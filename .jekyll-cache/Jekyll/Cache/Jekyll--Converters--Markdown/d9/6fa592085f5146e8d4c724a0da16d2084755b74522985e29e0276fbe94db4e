<p>This Challenge is open to any “Student Team,” which is defined as a group of at least three and not more than five adult (18 years of age or older at time of submission) individuals. Each team member (“Participant”) of the “Student Team” must be currently enrolled as a full-time  undergraduate or graduate student (someone who has earned a bachelor’s degree and is pursuing additional education in a specific field at a graduate school) at an accredited university or college or community college. Team mentors, including those who are both graduate students and teaching or graduate assistants, are not members of Student Teams.</p>

<p>The Student Teams are encouraged to be multidisciplinary, composed of students from diverse disciplines. Collaborations across programs that are novel and creative may include fine arts, performing arts, humanities, psychology, science, engineering, graphic design, IT (hardware and/or software), mathematics, statistics, environmental science, computational modeling, and others. Undergraduate students or graduate students (with or without graduate or teaching assistantships), except those that are designated as mentors for Student Teams, may participate in the Challenge in any combination.</p>

<p>To participate in and be eligible to win the Challenge, the Student Team must also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Have as a mentor to the team a faculty member employed at a Research Funding Organization, an Organization with Funded Research Grants, a Research Organization (i.e., academic research organizations, research institutes, or research centers), or a Department within a college or university, who has mentored undergraduate or graduate students in the past. The mentor will encourage success and provide ongoing guidance, support, and encouragement for the Student Team members.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The mentor should hold the position, including, but not limited to: Dean, Lecturer, Professor, Associate Professor, Assistant Professor, Research Assistant Professor, Instructor, or Teaching Assistant within a Grant or Research Organization or Center, Institute, or Department at a college or university in an academic setting similar to or the same as the Student Team.</li>
      <li>A Teaching or Graduate Assistant who is also a graduate student and is designated as a mentor for a Student Team cannot participate in the Challenge also as a member of the Student Team.</li>
      <li>Each mentor may only work with one team; however, a team may have more than one mentor. Co-mentors may be located at different institutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agree to submit only one entry into this Challenge through one student member of the Student Team that is appointed as the “Team Captain” by that Student Team. The Team Captain will carry out all correspondence with the NHLBI regarding the Student Team’s entry. On behalf of the Student Team, the Team Captain must certify the Student Team’s eligibility as part of the submission process.</p>
