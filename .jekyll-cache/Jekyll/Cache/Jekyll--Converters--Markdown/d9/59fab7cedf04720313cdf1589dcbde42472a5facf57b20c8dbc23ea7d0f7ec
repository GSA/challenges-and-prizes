I"c	<p>Devastating fungi are killing Hawaii&rsquo;s iconic ʻŌhiʻa trees.</p>
<p>Countless native species depend&nbsp;on the shade of the ʻŌhiʻa for their growth. Without its presence, native birds will lose a roosting habitat, and rainfall will erode the Hawaii's delicate island soils. Even the cycle of creation after a lava flow would be disrupted without the ʻŌhiʻa to help bring life back to the land.</p>
<p>Are you ready to invent a way to help us find the fungus before it wipes out this hallmark of Hawaii's landscape? Take up the challenge, be a HERO, win up $70,000, and establish yourself as a leader in the fungus world!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.savetheohia.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saving the ʻŌhiʻa</a> is an innovation competition that seeks novel turn-key tools and creative solutions to rapidly and inexpensively detect the fungal species <em>Ceratocystis lukuohia</em> and <em>Ceratocystis huliohia</em> in asymptomatic trees (i.e., trees that do not show signs of infection) as well as at the landscape scale in larger stands. We also seek tools that can detect the potential invasion transmission pathways (e.g., wind, streams, transported soil, forest products, tools, equipment, etc.) and potential reservoirs of the fungi that lead to its spread.</p>
<h4><strong>Help Others Develop Their Solutions</strong></h4>
<p>We encourage applicants to create a project profile in Conservation X Labs Digital Makerspace <a href="http://www.conservationx.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://conservationx.com/</a> to assist the applicant in the development of their proposed solution to the Challenge.</p>
<p>The Digital Makerspace is an online open community working toward creating tech solutions for conservation's greatest problems. Please see a detailed description of the <a href="https://www.savetheohia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohi'a Challenge</a> at the Conservation X Lab page. Note:&nbsp;The application needs to be submitted through "Submit" function on Challenge.gov.</p>
