<h4>Background</h4>
<p><a href="https://opportunity.census.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Opportunity Project (TOP)</a>, a program run by the Census Open Innovation Labs (COIL) at the U.S. Census Bureau, brings together government, communities, and the technology industry to create digital tools that address our nationâ€™s greatest challenges with open data. Through 12-week sprints, TOP challenges technologists outside of government â€“ companies, non-profits, and universities â€“ to create digital tools with Census and other federal open data to expand American economic opportunity.</p>
<p>TOP works with experts from the Census Bureau and other federal agencies to identify high-priority challenges facing the public, and then engages experts from the private and nonprofit sectors through technology development sprints. Each 12-week sprint results in new data-driven tools that directly serve families, local leaders, and businesses. This process helps to empower people with technology, make government data more accessible and user-friendly, and facilitate cross-sector collaboration to build new digital solutions with open data. </p>
<p>Since launching in 2016, 30 federal agencies and over 100 external organizations including companies, universities and community organizations have worked together to create 80 new digital products for the public.  These products provide solutions to challenges including the opioid crisis, disaster response, connecting veterans with jobs, promoting STEM education, and more. </p>
<p>TOP supports the Census Bureauâ€™s mission and Title 13 mandate to disseminate data to the public. It is also a component of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Presidents-Management-Agenda.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Presidentâ€™s Management Agenda</a> â€” namely, <a href="https://www.performance.gov/CAP/leveragingdata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cross Agency Priority (CAP) Goal 2:&nbsp; Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset</a>, championed by Commerce Deputy Secretary Karen Dunn Kelley, which focuses on utilizing data as an asset to grow the economy, increase the effectiveness of the Federal Government, promote transparency, and make government data more useful to the public, businesses, and researchers. TOP is also a <a href="https://strategy.data.gov/proof-points/2019/04/26/helping-baltimore-volunteers-find-where-to-help/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proof Point</a> within the first ever <a href="https://strategy.data.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Data Strategy</a>.</p>
<h4>The Problem</h4>
<p>Over 9 sprint cycles and nearly 4 years, it has become clear that one of the greatest challenges associated with civic technology development is product sustainability and adoption â€“ in short, what happens to these solutions after The Opportunity Project sprint process. Now, in order to help advance some of the most promising technology solutions developed through The Opportunity Project, the Census Bureau is launching a Prize Challenge to help tech teams deploy their technology solutions, ensure they reach end users and drive impact on the critical problems they aim to solve. This prize challenge is open to teams that have previously participated or are currently participating in The Opportunity Project, and built a digital product with open data through an Opportunity Project facilitated sprint or utilizing <a href="https://opportunity.census.gov/toolkit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Opportunity Project toolkit, which provides a step-by-step outline for replicating the sprint process</a>. <strong>The Census Bureau is conducting this challenge under the authority of and in accordance with the America COMPETES Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 3719.</strong></p>
<h4>Challenge Goals and Categories</h4>
<p>The Opportunity Project Prize Challenge is a new opportunity for teams who have participated in The Opportunity Project to compete for funding to expand their impact, deploy tools to end users, and begin to or continue to deliver impact on critical problems facing the public.</p>
<p>Because the challenges tackled in The Opportunity Project to date are so broad, COIL has identified five categories that capture a range of critical problems, described below. Teams applying for the prize must submit their product in at least one category, and can submit in up to 2 categories. </p>
<ol> <li><strong>2020 Census:&nbsp; Reaching Hard-to-Count Communities</strong>:&nbsp; e.g., products focusing on challenges such as increasing response rates in hard-to-count communities, bridging the digital divide, promoting online self-response through digital literacy, and promoting 2020 Census jobs;</li> <li><strong>Revolutionizing the Workforce:&nbsp; </strong>e.g., products focusing on challenges such as employment, training, education, supporting entrepreneurship, creating multiple pathways for careers, and developing regional talent pipelines for high growth development; </li> <li><strong>Building Thriving Communities:&nbsp; </strong>e.g., products focusing on challenges such as affordable housing, transportation information and infrastructure, public safety, investment in communities, and community infrastructure development;  </li> <li><strong>Creating Resilient People and Places:&nbsp; </strong>e.g., products focusing on challenges such as disaster preparedness and response, environmental stewardship, and local address databases to support first responders and other community needs; </li> <li><strong>Creating the Future of Health:&nbsp; </strong>e.g., products focusing on challenges such as the opioid crisis, connecting patients with clinical trials, public health and disease prevention, emotional wellbeing, and tick borne diseases.</li> </ol>
