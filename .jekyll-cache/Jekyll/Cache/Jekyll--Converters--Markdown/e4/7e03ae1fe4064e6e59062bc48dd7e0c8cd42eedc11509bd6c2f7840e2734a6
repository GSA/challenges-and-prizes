<p>The goal of the EHR Innovations for Improving Hypertension Challenge is to gather specific descriptions of health IT tools and approaches used by individual practices to implement an evidence-based blood pressure (BP) treatment protocol that has led to improvement in practice-wide blood pressure control (Phase 1), and identify models for quickly and widely spreading these to other practices (Phase 2). </p>
<p>A comprehensive clinical decision support (CDS) approach supports these <b>five protocol elements</b>:  <ul>   <li>1. Blood pressure measurement/recording</li>   <li>2. Blood pressure follow-up</li>   <li>3. Initiation and titration of medications</li>   <li>4. Patient engagement</li>   <li>5. Workup/referral for poor control</li>  </ul>  </p>
<p>In Phase 1 (three months), practices will document the electronic health record (EHR) tools they used to implement an evidence-based BP control protocol, as well as describe the details and results of the implementation. Practices must demonstrate high BP control levels and/or improvement to ensure that tools and strategies merit replication across practice settings.    </p>

<p>In Phase 2 (nine months), practices and their partners will conduct, evaluate and document dissemination strategies for tools recognized in Phase 1, emphasizing widespread, effective use of these tools by other practices. Submitters must demonstrate successful use of these tools in at least two additional practices.    Phase 1 will have up to four winners, each of whom will receive a $5,000 prize. Phase 2 will have a single winner of a $30,000 prize. Honorable Mention designations will be given for other Phase 1 submitters who provide CDS tools that reviewers select for Phase 2 dissemination efforts, and for other Phase 2 submitters with commendable CDS tool dissemination and implementation strategies. Both phases will recognize submitters in different categories such as practice type and size, based on the submissions received.    </p>
