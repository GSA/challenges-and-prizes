NIST will announce via the Event Website any Entry(ies) as to which the Judges have made a cash award (each, an “Award”).  The anticipated number and amount of the Awards that will be awarded for this Competition is set forth in the Federal Register Notice; however, the Judges are not obligated to make all or any Awards, and reserve the right to award fewer than the anticipated number of Awards in the event an insufficient number of eligible Entries meet any one or more of the Judging Criteria for this Competition, based on the Judges' evaluation of the quality of Entries and in their sole discretion.  Awards will be made based on the Judges’ evaluation of an Entry’s compliance with the Judging Criteria for this Competition.  All potential winners will be notified by the e-mail address provided in the submission document and may be required to complete further documentation confirming their eligibility.  Return of any notification as “undeliverable” will result in disqualification.  After verification of eligibility, Awards will be distributed in the form of a check or electronic funds transfer addressed to the official representative specified in the winning entry.  That official representative will have sole responsibility for further distribution of any Award among Participants in a group Entry or within a company or institution that has submitted an Entry through that representative.  Each list of Entries receiving Awards for the Competition will be made public according to the timeline outlined on the Event Website.    All Awards are a one-time offer and there is no offer of licensure, royalty, or other financial compensation implied beyond the Awards.  Winners are responsible for all taxes and reporting related to any Award received as part of the Competition.    All costs incurred in the preparation of Competition Entries are to be borne by Participants.  &lt;h4 id="evaluation-judging-and-selection-of-winner-s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation, Judging, and Selection of Winner(s)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 id="submission-evaluation-criteria"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Submission Evaluation Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  This section discusses how Participant submissions will be evaluated.  &lt;h5 id="entry-submission-and-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entry Submission and Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  The requirements for submission of a complete entry are detailed in the above section “Entry Process for Participants” and at the Event Website.  Submissions will be reviewed by Subject Matter Experts (described below), who will determine whether the submission &lt;strong&gt;meets the following minimum criteria for consideration for a Prize:  &lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ol&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General:&lt;/strong&gt; App submission should include detailed instructions on how to install and operate the App, and system requirements to run the App.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NIST Acknowledgment:&lt;/strong&gt; The following notice should be displayed prominently within the application: “This product uses data provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) but is not endorsed or certified by NIST.” The NIST SRD number must also be displayed prominently in the application. Use of the NIST or Department of Commerce logos is prohibited.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functionality/Accuracy:&lt;/strong&gt; A Submission may be disqualified if the software application fails to function as expressed in the description submitted by the Participant.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants should keep in mind that NIST considers protection of personal information an essential element of App security. Apps must seek user permission to access and use personal information.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security Vulnerabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants must agree that NIST may conduct testing on the App to determine whether malware or other security threats may be present. NIST may disqualify the App if, in NIST’s sole judgment, the App may damage government or others’ equipment or operating environment. For guidance about minimizing security vulnerabilities in mobile applications, Participants can consult NIST Special Publication 800-163, “Vetting the Security of Mobile Applications” (&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-163"&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-163&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Completeness:&lt;/strong&gt; other required components of the submission (as listed in the Entry Process for Participants section above) are complete.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  Submissions that meet the minimum criteria specified above will be presented to the Judges for evaluation.  Judges are not required to test the App and may choose to judge based solely on the text description, images, and video provided in the Submission. Judges will evaluate submissions using the following &lt;strong&gt;Judging Criteria (the weighting percentage for each criterion is given in parentheses)&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;ol&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential impact:&lt;/strong&gt; How strong is the potential of the submission to help students and other technical experts use NIST Standard Reference Data? (25%)&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creativity and Innovation:&lt;/strong&gt; To what degree is this submission innovative? Does it bring new thinking and creativity to improving access to NIST Standard Reference Data? (25%)&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation:&lt;/strong&gt; Does the App work well? Does it provide an engaging user experience and have interactive capabilities? (25%)&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uses scientific reference data:&lt;/strong&gt; Does the App use at least one of the eligible datasets? Preference will be given to applications that integrate more than one dataset. (25%)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;h5 id="awards"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Awards&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  First, Second, and Third Place Prizes will be selected by the Judges.  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;First Place Prize is $30,000&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Second Place Prize is $10,000&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Third Place Prize is $5,000&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;h5 id="subject-matter-experts-and-judges"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subject Matter Experts and Judges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  Subject Matter Experts, to be selected by NIST, will, as a body, represent a high degree of technical background in App development, software security, and scientific research data. Subject Matter Experts will consist of NIST employees or NIST associates and will provide initial assessments of App submissions using the criteria described herein to determine whether the submission meets the minimum criteria.  Subject Matter Experts will not select winners of any Awards.    A panel of highly qualified Judges appointed by the NIST Director will select winners of Awards to be awarded to First, Second, and Third Place Submissions using the Judging Criteria described herein. The panel of Judges has a collective expertise that creates an overall balanced panel with broad representation of relevant areas to the challenge such as App design, NIST datasets, measurement science, standards, data security, user interfaces, websites, and/or mobile devices. Judges include individuals from both inside and outside NIST who are experts in areas relevant to the challenge. The Judges may not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of any entity that is a registered Participant in this Competition, and may not have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a registered Participant.  In the event of such a conflict, a Judge must recuse himself or herself.  A Participant(s) should review the list of the Judges available at the Event Website, and must identify, as part of their Entry submission, any Judge who has personal or financial interests in, or is an employee, officer, director, or agent of any entity that is a Participant in this Competition, or who has a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a Participant.  Thereafter, a Participant(s) must immediately inform the Competition Sponsor through the Event Website of a change in status resulting in a conflict for any Judge as described above.  Failure to do so may disqualify a Participant(s) from receiving an Award.  &lt;h4 id="intellectual-property-rights"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellectual property rights&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h4&gt;  Other than as set forth herein, NIST does not make any claim to ownership of your Entry or any of your intellectual property or third party intellectual property that it may contain therein.  By participating in the Competition, you are not granting any rights in any patents or pending patent applications related to your Entry; provided that by submitting an Entry, you are granting NIST certain limited rights as set forth herein.
