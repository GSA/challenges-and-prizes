I"…	<p>The application will be scored based on the hypertension control rate for your most recent 12-month reporting period.¬†</p>

<p>Applicants with the highest score will participate in a two-phase process to verify their data. Applicant who are non-compliant or non-responsive with requests or timelines will be removed from further consideration.</p>

<p>Phase 1 includes verification of the hypertension prevalence and blood pressure control rate data submitted and a background check. For applicants whose Phase 1 data is verified as accurate, phase 2 consists of a medical chart review.¬† Phase 1 of the verification of hypertension prevalence and blood pressure control rate data is estimated to take 1 hours.¬† In addition, background checks will be conducted by an independent source for individual or small practice applicants to ensure there are no serious sanctions or that other misconduct has occurred (as outlined in the Eligibility section).¬† For large providers or health systems, their background check policy and implementation will be reviewed for compliance with the individual background check protocol.¬† In addition, a health system background check will include a search for The Joint Commission‚Äôs sanctions and current investigations for serious institutional misconduct (e.g., investigations for professional medical misconduct).¬†</p>

<p>Phase 2 of the validation, for applicants whose Phase 1 data is verified as accurate, consists of hypertension control validation via medical chart review.¬†</p>

<p>Applicants must provide documents showing the criteria used to include patients as ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and a list with each hypertensive patient found to have blood pressure in control. Thirty patient records (60 in the case of large health systems) will be selected randomly for file review for compliance. For the thirty records selected, electronic copies of all of the pertinent medical records will be submitted through a secure FTP site with a secure login. Criteria for compliance with the measure include having documentation of having at least one outpatient encounter with a diagnosis of hypertension during the first 6 months of the measurement period and evidence that the patient‚Äôs most recent blood pressure is adequately controlled (a reading of &lt;140/&lt;90 mmHg).</p>

<p>Performance categories: HIGH (90% ‚Äì 100% of the records are in compliance with the review criteria); MEDIUM (60% ‚Äì 89% in compliance); or LOW (less than 60% in compliance).</p>
