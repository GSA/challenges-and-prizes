I"<p><strong>What new insights can come from Congressional data?</strong>    A variety of Congressional publications and data sets are available on Congress.gov. The Library of Congress (LC) invites you to leverage that data to create new meaning or tools to help members of Congress and the public explore it in new ways.    <strong>What are we looking for?</strong>    LC would like to inspire creative use of technology to analyze digital Congressional information from Congress.gov. This could take the form of interactive visualizations, mobile or desktop applications, a website, or other digital creation.    <strong>Submission Criteria</strong>    Final submission will include a 2-minute demonstration video explaining a product, the data sources used, and its benefits. Source code is required to be published and licensed as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/">CC0.</a>    <strong>Prizes</strong>    LC will award $5,000 for first prize and $1,000 for the best high-school project. Honorable mentions may be awarded for:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Best tracking of legislative status&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Best data visualization, and&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Best data mashup&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  To get you thinking, we offer a few example projects:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;A visualization of how the legislative process works using legislative data&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Tools that could be embedded on Congressional and public websites&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Legislative matching service, to identify Members with similar legislative interests&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Tools to improve accessibility of legislative data, and&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;A tool that, based on bill text, identifies Members of Congress with legislative interests that are similar to the user’s, or to the legislative interests of other Members of Congress&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Solvers may want to review the winners of the <a href="https://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2016-07-25">Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers Data Challenge</a> for inspiration in how innovators of all ages have looked at data in different ways.    <strong>Acknowledgements</strong>    Thanks to all of those who helped shape this contest, especially the National Endowment for the Humanities following its successful <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/chronicling-america-historic-american-newspapers-data-challenge/">Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers Data Challenge</a>; the United States Government Publishing Office’s <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/">Federal Digital System</a> / <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/">govinfo</a> team; and the Internet Education Foundation, coordinator of the <a href="http://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/">Congressional App Challenge.</a></p>
