I"”<p>In the EmPOWER Air Data Challenge, EPAâ€™s Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) is seeking proposals from academic and research institutions for practical and replicable projects using at least one of CAMDâ€™s emissions or environmental monitoring datasets.</p>

<p>Submissions for innovative and creative uses of CAMD data should advance the knowledge, use, and understanding of CAMD data and related information, with priority on the following possible project themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Analyzing data:</strong> Answer timely and relevant research questions using CAMD data</li>
  <li><strong>Enhancing communications:</strong> Design new and innovative ways to present CAMD data to the public</li>
  <li><strong>Developing technology and data mashups:</strong> Develop new technologies or analytic methods to integrate CAMD data with other datasets to unlock the broader potential of CAMD data</li>
  <li><strong>Promoting environmental education:</strong> Explore opportunities to use CAMD data in high school or university classrooms</li>
  <li><strong>Improving data quality:</strong> Identify and apply algorithms (e.g., machine learning) to electronically audit CAMD data and enhance data quality</li>
</ul>

<p>Still looking for more inspiration? Past winners have integrated CAMD data with satellite data and other energy datasets to answer research questions. Others have created lesson plans for university students to create websites summarizing emissions at different power plants using CAMD data. Recent events may also spark ideas. Projects could characterize or evaluate energy equity or quantify the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic response on electricity and air quality.</p>

<p>Project submissions should use at least one of the following CAMD datasets:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/power-sector-emissions-data">CAMDâ€™s Power Sector Emissions Data:</a> CAMD collects the Power Sector Emissions Data from over 4,000 electricity generating units to ensure compliance with emission reduction programs like the Acid Rain Program and the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. This robust dataset includes information on: hourly emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon dioxide (CO2); operating parameters, like hourly heat input and gross electricity output; and facility attributes, like location, fuel types, monitoring systems, and air pollution controls.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.epa.gov/castnet">Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET) Data:</a> CAMD, in cooperation with the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and many other partners, operates theÂ <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/castnet/docs/CASTNET_Factsheet_2019.pdf">CASTNET monitoring program</a>Â to assess long-term trends in air quality and deposition and provide accountability for emission reduction programs. CASTNET measures hourly ozone concentrations to support EPAâ€™s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and regional transport evaluations. Weekly gaseous (SO2, HNO3) and aerosol (SO42-, NO3-, NH4+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, Cl-) concentrations are also collected at more than 90 sites.</li>
  <li><strong>NEW!</strong>Â <a href="https://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/monitoring-surface-water-chemistry">Long Term Monitoring (LTM) Data:</a> CAMD also partners with states, universities, and other federal agencies to run the Long Term Monitoring (LTM) program, which monitors critical water quality Â Â parameters to track the status of acidified and acid-sensitive lakes and streams in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States. LTM currently consists of a network of 171 lakes and streams that are sampled monthly to annually. Major parameters monitored include: anions (NO3-, SO42-, Cl-), cations (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+), acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), and pH.</li>
</ul>

<p>Project submissions may include other datasets not listed here but should include at least one of the three above datasets.</p>
