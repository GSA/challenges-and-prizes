I"6&<p>USSOCOM is pursuing a development effort to determine the operational utility of using CubeSats to directly support SOF in austere and denied areas. The intent is to solicit operationally relevant and technically feasible payload concepts for USSOCOM CubeSats.         Example areas that are relevant to USSOCOM missions are (not an exhaustive list):  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Next-generation CubeSat and/or sensor technologies&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Advanced communications; including full orbit Command &amp; Control and data exfiltration&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Electro-Optical (EO)/Infrared (IR) sensing and imaging&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Multi/Hyper spectral sensor technology&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Propulsion capabilities to modify or maintain orbits&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Advanced On-Orbit data processing&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Multi-function payloads&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Tagging, Tracking and Locating capabilities&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  What is needed to make a basic CubeSat? (not an exhaustive list):  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Solar Cells/Panels&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;A Battery Pack&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;A Power Management System&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Transceiver (FCC or equivalent license required)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Antennas&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Processor(s) (Microprocessors or FPGAs)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Flight Software (Satellite and payload control)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS, Optional)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Propulsion (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Ground Station (Separate)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;h2&gt;Prizes&lt;/h2&gt;  The CubeSat Challenge will award a grand total of up to $35,000 in cash prizes. Up to 7 - $5,000 prizes will be awarded in the following categories:    <strong>4</strong> - 3U Winners    <strong>2</strong> - 6U Winners    <strong>1</strong> people’s Choice Award         The $5,000 popular choice award will be awarded based on number of votes received during the voting period.  A competitor is eligible to win both a Judges’ Award and the People’s Choice Award.    All votes are subject to review. Any competitor using unfair methods to solicit votes will be automatically disqualified from the challenge.    Entries that are eligible for the voting stage will become viewable to the public. Make sure that if your entry moves on to the voting stage, that you’re OK with anyone seeing it! Depending on the number of entries received, either all or a selected shortlist will move on to the voting stage.    Potential future challenges may ask competitors to design, develop, and implement concept submissions entered in this challenge.       &lt;h2&gt;How do I win?&lt;/h2&gt;  To be eligible for an award, the solution must, at minimum meet the following specifications and standards:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt; Payload Volume  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Range from 1.5U to 4U. Concepts will be considered that utilize up to 4U volume (to integrate onto a 6U CubeSat), but primary interest is for 1.5U payload concepts.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Payload Mass  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Up to 2.7kg for a 1.5U payload. Payload mass up to 6.5kg for a 4U payload.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Conformity  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Conform to <a href="https://herox.com/cubesat-challenge/resource/129"><u>CubeSat Design Specification, Rev 13, Cal Poly SLO, February 20, 2014</u></a>&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Durability  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Survive launch environments as described in <a href="https://herox.com/cubesat-challenge/resource/130"><u>Goddard Space Flight Center Std-7000, General Environmental Verification Standard (GEVS), April 2013.</u></a>&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Form Factors  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Either:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;3U: 10cm x 10cm x 30cm  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Standard 3U host-side basic avionics takes up 1.5U, leaving &lt;1.5U available for a payload.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;6U: 10cm x 20cm x 30cm  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Standard 6U host-side basic avionics takes up 2U, leaving 4U available for a payload.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Viable for a prototype demonstration within 12-24 months&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;h2&gt;Judging Scorecard&lt;/h2&gt;  The judging panel will rank the eligible Solutions submitted using the following Judging Scorecard:  &lt;table border="1" width="524" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;  &lt;p align="center"&gt;<strong>Metric</strong>&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;  &lt;p align="center"&gt;<strong>Description</strong>&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;  &lt;p align="center"&gt;<strong>Weight</strong>&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Advances the State of CubeSat Technology&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Does the proposed solution advance the state of CubeSat technology?&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;  &lt;p align="center"&gt;25%&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Helps Special Operations Forces (SOF) Missions&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Does the proposed solution advance SOF missions?&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;  &lt;p align="center"&gt;25%&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Novelty and Innovativeness&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Is the proposed solution unique, stretches the bounds of science and engineering, and inspire a spirit of innovation?&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;  &lt;p align="center"&gt;25%&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Feasibility&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Is the proposed solution viable for a prototype demonstration within 12-24 months?&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;  &lt;p align="center"&gt;25%&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;  &lt;/table&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Rules&lt;/h2&gt;  <u>Eligibility:</u>    The CubeSat Challenge is open to individuals, age 18 or older, private teams, public teams, and collegiate teams.
