I"¿<p>DREAMS is an ambitious partnership to reduce new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women in 10 sub-Saharan African countries. The goal of DREAMS is help girls develop into <strong>Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-Free, Mentored,</strong> and <strong>Safe</strong> women. DREAMS is delivering a Core Package of evidence-informed approaches that go beyond the health sector, addressing the structural drivers that directly or indirectly increase girls HIV risk, including poverty, gender inequality, sexual violence, and lack of education.    The DREAMS Partnership has committed $85 million for the DREAMS Innovation Challenge to support solutions to address unmet needs not covered by the DREAMS Core Package.    The DREAMS Innovation Challenge seeks to award and implement innovative solutions in six focus areas that further DREAMSâ€™ commitment to reduce HIV infections by infusing new thinking and high-impact approaches to meet the urgent, complex needs of adolescent girls and young women in the 10 DREAMS countries â€“ Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The six Challenge Focus areas are:  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Focus 1: </strong>Strengthening capacity of communities for service delivery&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Focus 2: </strong>Keeping girls in secondary school&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Focus 3: </strong>Linking men to services&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Focus 4: </strong>Supporting pre-exposure prophylaxis&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Focus 5: </strong>Providing a bridge to employment&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Focus 6: </strong>Applying data to increase impact&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;</p>
