I"÷4<p>1) <em>Subject of Competition: </em>The Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking a new design to be used as the official logo of EV Everywhere.¬† EV Everywhere is the umbrella activity for DOE efforts to increase the use of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs).¬† Its mission is to raise awareness of the benefits of PEVs, help individuals realize that PEVs are a viable option for them, and position DOE as the definitive resource for unbiased, objective information about PEVs.    EV Everywhere supports DOE‚Äôs larger goal of reducing the use of petroleum in transportation to increase energy and environmental security.¬† In addition to public outreach and education, it also includes efforts to reduce the cost and improve the convenience of PEVs through research and development as well as increase community readiness for the use of PEVs. For further information, contact¬†<a href="mailto:ev-everywhere@ee.doe.gov">ev-everywhere@ee.doe.gov</a>.    ¬†    <br />2) <em>Dates: </em>The submission period for entries begins at August 13, 2015 and must be received electronically by September 25, 2015 by 11:59 p.m. EST.

You may use Federal facilities or consult with Federal employees during the competition if the facilities and employees are made available to all contestants participating in the competition on an equitable basis.    ¬†    <br />4) <em>Registration Process for Contestants:</em> Design competition contestants must submit their ‚ÄúEV Everywhere‚Äù Logo designs online as a vector-based image in an .ai, .eps, or PDF file using the link designated for that purpose on https://www.challenge.gov. Contestants can find the link on https://challenge.gov, either by filtering search criteria to ‚ÄúDepartment of Energy‚Äù or going to https://www.vehicles.energy.gov, where the link will be posted. DOE will accept logo design competition submissions only through https://www.challenge.gov.    Things to keep in mind as you design your ‚ÄúEV Everywhere‚Äù Logo:    a) The logo should translate the core elements of the EV Everywhere brand, including the benefits of PEVs, the viability of PEVs for the average driver, and EV Everywhere as the source for objective, data-driven, reliable information on PEVs. DOE‚Äôs <a href="http://www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric.html">Alternative Fuels Data Center</a> describes the basic technology of PEVs and PEVs‚Äô major benefits;    b) In addition, the logo can evoke through imagery ideas of: electricity, the ‚Äúfun‚Äù factor of PEVs, PEVs‚Äô cost savings, environmental sustainability, and energy security;    c) The use of the words ‚ÄúEV Everywhere‚Äù is recommended, but not required;    d) The use of the words ‚ÄúU.S. Department of Energy‚Äù is required;    e) The logo should use the following colors alone or in combination:  &lt;ol&gt;   &lt;li&gt;As primary, dark blue (Pantone 308; CMYK C100 M19 Y8 K46; RGB R0 G91 B130; HEX 005B82) and/or dark green (Pantone 356; CMYK C95 M8 Y93 K27; RGB R0 G121 B52; HEX 007934)&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;As highlights, light blue (Pantone 2995; CMYK C87 M1 Y0 K0; RGB R0 G169 B224; HEX 1F82BB), light green (Pantone 368; CMYK C63 M0 Y97 K0; RGB R105 G190 B40; HEX 69BE28), yellow (Pantone 116; CMYK C0 M12 Y100 K0; RGB R254 G203 B0; HEX FECB00), red (Pantone 158; CMYK C0 M64 Y95 K0; RGB R227 G114 B34; HEX E37222), and light gray (Pantone 428; CMYK C12 M6 Y5 K12; RGB R195 G200 B200; HEX C3C8C8)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  f) If the logo includes text, the text should be in Gotham font, or if not available, Calibri;    g) The logo should be unique enough that it could be easily recognized by the general public in the future;    h) Because it will be used on a vehicle magnetic logo the size of a small bumper sticker, the logo needs to be readable and/or understandable from the back of a moving vehicle.    i) The logo should not focus solely on light-duty PEVs; and    j) The logo should not conflict or be too similar to existing DOE/EERE logos (available on the <a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/communicationstandards/logos.html">EERE Communications Standards website</a>) or use elements of the DOE or any other federal agency‚Äôs logo.    When uploading your ‚ÄúEV Everywhere‚Äù Logo design, in the ‚ÄúSubmission Text‚Äù field, please include a brief description about your logo entry and thought process behind the design, including any personal experience the designer has with PEVs.    ¬†    <br />5) <em>Prize for Winner</em>: The winning contestant will be awarded a $5,000 prize and the design will become the official logo for the EV Everywhere activities, the magnetic decals, the program‚Äôs website and any official DOE purpose.    ¬†    <br />6) <em>Selection of Winner</em>: DOE will select a judging panel that will consist of DOE officials, EV industry leaders, and other communications experts. Judges will be fair and impartial. A judge may not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of any contestant or have a familial or financial relationship with a contestant.    Judges will use the following weighted criteria to judge the submitted designs:    (a) Effectiveness of communicating the EV Everywhere mission and brand (500/1000 points).¬† This includes the idea of plug-in electric vehicles, their benefits, their viability for the average driver, and the DOE as a source of unbiased, data-driven information. This may be done through a realistic or abstract design;    (b) Creativity and originality (300/1000 points). Is the visual quality of the design at once informative and representative of imagery connected to EV Everywhere; and    (c) Design can be easily replicated, especially as a magnetic decal (200/1000 points). Can this design be replicated successfully, without excessive cost, for many media formats.    The judging panel will evaluate the submissions and choose the final winning design from all submissions.¬† In the event that no entries fully meet the above criteria to the panel‚Äôs satisfaction, the Department of Energy is under no obligation to select a winner.¬† All decisions by DOE are final and binding with respect to the contest.¬† For questions or further information, please see the contact information listed in the <strong>DATES</strong> section above.    ¬†    <br />7) <em>Applicable Law</em>: This design competition is being conducted by DOE pursuant to the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act requirements at 15 U.S.C. 3719 and is subject to all applicable federal laws and regulations.
