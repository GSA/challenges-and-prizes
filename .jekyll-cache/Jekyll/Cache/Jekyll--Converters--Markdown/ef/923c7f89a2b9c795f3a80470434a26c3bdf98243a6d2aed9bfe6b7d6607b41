I"<p>This Challenge engages those in the health care community working on these issues, as well as new players from other industries, such as human-centered design and digital tech, to help in redesigning the “Medical Bill” or the “Medical Billing Process.” </p>
<p>   “A Bill You Can Understand” design and innovation challenge will invite participants to design a medical bill that is easier to understand, as well as reinvent cost of care estimation and the medical billing journey with the goal of improving the patient financial experience. Participants will be asked to submit entries that improve both the design of the medical bill and patient experience of the medical billing process. Submissions will include the (1) design concept for the redesigned medical bill, (2) journey map or wireframe for the redesigned patient experience, (3) written explanation of submission, and (3) video explanation of submission. </p>
<p>Specific criteria for the written and video explanations will be provided on the Challenge Website.  These may include but are not limited to explaining how the redesign will better empower patients to understand the financial information provided on their medical bill and take appropriate action and vision for an improved patient financial experience.</p>
<p>  The challenge is sponsored by AARP, administrated by Mad*Pow, an experience design agency, and organized in collaboration with HHS.    Two winning contestants will be selected for the following prizes:  <ul>   <li><u>Prize 1 – $5000</u>: Most Improved Medical Bill Design (Focusing on the design of the bill itself).</li>   <li><u>Prize 2 – $5000</u>: Transformational Approach to Medical Cost Estimation and Billing Process (Focusing on what the patient sees and does throughout the process).</li>  </ul></p>
