<p><!-- end of table --> &lt;p&gt;<em><span lang="EN">NOTE:  NIST makes an independent assessment of each Concept Paper based on the evaluation criteria. NIST will not review or consider incomplete Concept Papers. During the review, each subject matter expert and Judging panel member will review entire concept papers to which they are assigned. The review is not done in sections with different reviewers responsible for different assigned sections. Therefore, it is not necessary to repeat information in every part of the concept paper. Do not include sensitive materials in the concept paper, for example personally identifiable information like social security numbers, business sensitive information like tax id numbers, etc.</span></em>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;<strong><span lang="EN">Concept Paper Evaluation Criteria:</span></strong>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;<span lang="EN">To learn how papers will be evaluated, view the Judging Criteria tab or <a href="/a/buzz/challenge/1003/ideas/top#challenge-judging-criterias">click here</a>.</span>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;<strong><span lang="EN">How to Enter:</span></strong>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;<span lang="EN">For instructions on how to enter Phase 1, view the How to Enter tab or <a href="/a/buzz/challenge/1003/ideas/top#challenge-how-to-enter">click here</a>.</span>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;<a href="/community-library/1043/PSCR_HapticInterfacesforPublicSafetyChallenge_OfficialRules.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span lang="EN">View the Official Rules document for all contest phases.</span></strong></a>&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;<span lang="EN">For questions about the Official Rules, contact: <a href="mailto:psprizes@nist.gov">psprizes@nist.gov</a></span>&lt;/div&gt; <!-- end of Rules --></p>
