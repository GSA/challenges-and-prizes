I"§<p>An interested Participant (individual, team, or legal entity) must initiate the process of participating in the Competition by registering at the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/el/intelligent-systems-division-73500/agile-robotics-industrial-automation-competition">ARIAC website</a>. The party is then given access to view the documentation and download the tutorials (which provides instructions on how to run the simulations) from the ARIAC website. In the event NIST determines modifications to the documentation and tutorials are needed, all website registrants will be notified by email.</p>

<p>Once registered, the Participants are eligible to participate in the qualifier. The qualifier will occur in the April 2021 timeframe (specific deadlines will be published at the official challenge website and all Participants notified by email). Participants must complete the qualifier to be eligible to compete in the final competition. A minimum score will be determined, based on the metrics described below, which Participants have to meet or exceed in the qualifier to be eligible for the final competition.</p>

<p>Participants will run the qualifier from their own location. They will have two weeks from the date that the qualifier is released on the website (available to be downloaded) to submit their software control system that addresses the challenges in the qualifier. Registered participants will be emailed when the qualifier is released. They should run the qualifier at their own location and submit the resulting output files generated by their control system (listed below).  Their output files should be uploaded to an account (nfiles.nist.gov) that NIST will set up specifically for each Participant.</p>

<p>Specific files that need to be submitted include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Their environment configuration file specifying your choice of sensors.</li>
  <li>A performance log file that contains information about the task completion.</li>
  <li>A simulation state log file that contains information about the state of Gazebo during the trial.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your output files should be uploaded to an account (nfiles.nist.gov) that NIST will set up specifically for each Participant.</p>
