I"<p>Unidentified and misidentified prescription pills present challenges for patients and professionals. Unidentified pills can be found by family members, health professionals, educators, and law enforcement. The nine out of 10 U.S. citizens over age 65 who take more than one prescription pill can be prone to misidentifying those pills. Taking such pills can result in adverse drug events that affect health or cause death. To reduce such errors, any person should easily be able to confirm that a prescription pill or a refill is correct. For example, a person should be able to easily verify – or not – that a refill that has a different color, shape, or text imprinted on the pill is a different generic version of equivalent drugs he or she was already taking. The objective of the Challenge is the development and discovery of high-quality algorithms and software that rank how well consumer images of prescription pills match reference images of pills in the authoritative NLM RxIMAGE database. NLM may use all or part of any Challenge entry (i.e., algorithm and software) to create a future software system and a future API (Application Programming Interface) for pill image recognition; the system will be freely usable and the API will be freely accessible.     </p>
