I"T<p>Health and Human Services professionals understand that climate change impacts the health of their communities. Do you have an innovative idea for an app that could help communicate these impacts, and drive action to meet the population’s health needs? If your idea includes location data and Esri technology, then enter the Esri Human Health and Climate Change App Challenge.  </p>
<p>  <strong>The Challenge</strong>    <a href="http://www.esri.com/landing-pages/industries/health/climate-change-app-challenge">Esri's Climate Change and Human Health App Challenge</a> is open to everyone - including developers, start-ups, governments, academics, and NGOs to name a few. Get creative for this important initiative by using the growing pool of open data and Esri apps, maps, services, and APIs. Judges will select the best of the best apps to be featured at Esri’s Health and Human Services GIS Conference. Esri will award prizes and share the winning apps on our Collaborative Resource Portal.   </p>
<p> Participants are encouraged to create apps that help health and human services professionals understand how and where climate change is affecting the health of their communities, evaluate actions that can make a real difference, and communicate these results in an intuitive way.
