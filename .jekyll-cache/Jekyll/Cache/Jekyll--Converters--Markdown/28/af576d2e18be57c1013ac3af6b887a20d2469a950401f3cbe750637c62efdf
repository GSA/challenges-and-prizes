I"Ù/<p>Terms and Conditions: ORNL Buildings Community    <strong>Introduction:</strong>    UT-Battelle, LLC, managing and operating the Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL) pursuant to its Prime Contract with U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is hosting three crowdsourcing idea campaigns (Campaigns):  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Space Conditioning and Appliance Ideas&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Sensors and Controls Ideas&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Envelope Technologies Ideas&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  The goal of the idea Campaigns is to bring buildings sector stakeholders from industry, academia, and government, and technology innovation together, which will enable stakeholders to potentially shape the energy efficient building solutions reaching the market.    The UT-Battelle team will rely on website users to vote on the best ideas with potential for transforming the building energy efficiency technologies market. A shortlist of the top five ideas per Campaign will be identified based on the highest number of votes received per idea. A group of independent technical judges consisting of UT-Battelle staff and other industry stakeholders will review the shortlisted ideas. The technical judges will evaluate the ideas based on criteria such as technical feasibility, energy saving potential, market size, and novelty of the idea. The technical judges will then select the best one or two ideas per Campaign. The best one or two ideas will be recognized during Industry Day taking place at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in September of 2015. The submitters of the best ideas will potentially be invited to attend Industry Day, at their own expense, to present their idea or participate in panel discussions.    These Campaigns are being administered by UT-Battelle using the IdeaScale web platform. IdeaScale, UT-Battelle, and DOE, hereinafter ‚ÄúSupporters,‚Äù are cooperatively working to administer the Campaigns.    <strong>Important Dates:</strong>  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Submission Period Begins: Friday, February 20, 2015.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Submission Period Ends: Sunday, May 31, 2015 at 11:59 p.m. EST.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;UT-Battelle reserves the right to modify the Submission, judging and/or voting periods at any time for any reason.
