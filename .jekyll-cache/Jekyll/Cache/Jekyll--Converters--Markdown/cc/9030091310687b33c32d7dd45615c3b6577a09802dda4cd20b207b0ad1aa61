I"C<p>Entries should be submitted via the Challenge’s homepage on challenge.gov.</p>

<p>You can use existing tools or platforms or create your own application to produce these visualizations. The geographic scale of the visualization can be as small as the neighborhood or community level or as large as the regional or national level.</p>

<p>Submissions should help identify potential areas or zones of increased exposure and/or the degree of changes in exposure or health risk resulting from climate change.  You may consider a short-term time scale (e.g., 0 to 20 years) for impacts associated with extreme events, or a longer time scale (e.g., 2050 or beyond) for impacts associated with sea level rise or other phenomena whose greatest impact will clearly be decades from now.</p>

<p>The challenge will award prizes for visualizations, tools, or applications for decision making in two categories: Category 1 for use at the local or municipal level and Category 2 for use at a regional (multistate) or national level. In each category, up to three prizes and $17,500 will be awarded, for a total of $35,000 in prize money.</p>

<p><u>A complete submission should contain the following items and nothing more: </u></p>
<ol>
	<li>A brief (less than 250 words) description of the visualization and its potential value in improving our understanding of the relationship between environmental exposures and climate change.</li>
	<li>A detailed description (limited to 1000 words, not including figures or references) of the visualization, tool, or application, including the technical basis for combining data layers and references to the scientific literature supporting the relationships between climate change, altered exposures, and human health outcomes, where relevant.</li>
	<li>The visualization tool and any application or code needed to run the tool. Alternatively, instead of providing the tool or application itself, you may provide either a link to a visualization generated by the tool or application; a video demonstrating the tool or application; or one or more pdfs of example visualizations.</li>
	<li>Instructions on how to install and operate any application behind a visualization tool.</li>
	<li>System requirements required to run the application.</li>
	<li>A description of, rationale for selecting, and complete copy of the data set. For data sets contained within climate.data.gov or otherwise easily obtainable from Federal sources, the URLs for the datasets are sufficient.</li>
</ol>
<p>To be eligible to win this Challenge, submissions must also meet the following requirements:</p>

<p>1) Participants must provide continuous access to any submissions that include web postings through the Challenge period until January 12, 2016.</p>

<p>2) Submissions must be in English.</p>

<p>3) The data visualization tool or application must not use HHS or NIH logos or official seals in the submission, and must not claim or imply endorsement by the Federal government.</p>

<p>4) The data visualization tool or application must be designed for use with existing web, mobile, voice, or other platform for supporting interactions of the content provided with other capabilities.</p>

<p>5) A submission may be disqualified if the visualization tool or application fails to function as expressed in the description provided by the participant, or if the tool or application provides inaccurate or incomplete information.</p>

<p>6) Submissions must be free of malware. Participant agrees that NIH may conduct testing on the data visualization tool or application to determine whether malware or other security threats may be present. NIEHS may disqualify the submission if, in NIEHS’ judgment, the data visualization tool or application or any other part of the submission may damage government or others’ equipment or operating environment.</p>

<p>In order for submissions to be evaluated, they must include clear, detailed processes on how they were produced, including any code if applicable. The processes can be submitted in a text document.</p>

<p>This Challenge is most interested in submissions that show the interaction between these three data layers:</p>
<ol>
  <li>locations and concentrations of harmful agents (i.e., exposures);</li>
  <li>locations of potentially exposed populations; and</li>
  <li>geographic and climatologic parameters conveying changing risks of exposure.</li>
</ol>

<p>At a minimum, all submissions should include a data layer related to location of potential harmful agents and a data layer related to changes in levels of exposure to those potential agents cause by factors related to climate change.</p>
