I"+<p><strong>Finalist Criteria</strong></p>
<p>The first five eligible submissions that comply with the rules of this Federal Register Notice (see also the Rules page of this website), follow the detailed submission instructions, are complete, are able to fully replicate RAT-STATS on 60 target cases, and include a description of a reasonable method for adding additional modules will each be declared a finalist. Once five finalists have been identified, no further entries from teams not previously identified as finalists will be reviewed even if they are submitted prior to the May 15, 2017, 5:00 p.m. EST deadline. Moreover, the contest will end on May 15, 2017, at 5:00 p.m. EST even if fewer than five finalists have been selected.&nbsp;<br /><br />Finalists may update their entries without losing their finalist designation. Updates from the finalists will be accepted until 5:00 p.m. EST on the fourteenth day after the fifth finalist has been identified or May 15, 2017, 5:00 p.m. EST, whichever comes first. The newest entry from each team will be used for all judging purposes unless otherwise requested by the team.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Grand Prize Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Twelve OIG employees who use the current version of the RAT-STATS software will review the submissions from the five finalists and vote on which package they would prefer to serve as the RAT-STATS replacement. The package with the most votes will be the winner of the Grand Prize. Ties will be broken by the Office of Inspector General, Office of Audit Services, Director of Quantitative Methods. The instructions to the judges will be as follows, "Please review the operation of the following software packages and select one that you would prefer to use in the future for selecting and analyzing your statistical samples." Critically, the instructions do not ask which software is most like RAT-STATS, but rather which software they would prefer to use. As a result, during the review for the Grand Prize, judges will consider features even if they were not part of the original RAT-STATS package.</p>
