I"Õ<p>Long-Distance space travel will require astronauts to be able to launder clothing in space. There are currently few or no efficient means of washing clothing within the micro-gravity of space since terrestrial cleaning processes cannot be directly applied. This Challenge asks Solvers to conceive of new methods of cleaning clothing such that it can be performed either on the International Space Station or aboard a vehicle that travels beyond low-earth orbit.</p>
