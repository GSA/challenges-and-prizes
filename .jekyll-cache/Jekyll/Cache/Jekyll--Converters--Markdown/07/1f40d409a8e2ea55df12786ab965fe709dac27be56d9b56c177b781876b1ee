<p><strong>Submission Tracks</strong></p>
<p>The pace of innovation in both computer vision and satellite imagery have been increasingly rapidly. Much of that innovation is happening at universities, startups, and the commercial sector. To maximize the community of solvers who are able to participate in the Challenge, we have implemented three separate submission tracks for this Challenge. Solvers may choose to participate in whichever track best suits their needs:</p>
<p><strong>Track 1:&nbsp; Open Source</strong></p>
<p>If you choose to participate in Track 1, you agree to release your code under one of the approved permissive open source licenses:&nbsp; Apache 2.0, BSD, LGPL, or MIT. Participants in this track are eligible for both the main award pool and additional incentives reserved for Open Source submissions only.</p>
<p>Additional award:&nbsp; $25,000</p>
<p><strong>Track 2:&nbsp; Government Purpose Rights</strong></p>
<p>If you choose to participate in Track 2, you agree to grant non-exclusive Government Purpose Rights for your solution, and will be eligible for the main award pool.</p>
<p>1st - $37,950; 2nd - $28,750; 3rd - $23,000; 4th - $17,000; 5th - $8,300</p>
<p><strong>Track 3:&nbsp; Evaluation Only</strong></p>
<p>If you choose to participate in Track 3, you grant us only the minimal rights required to evaluate your submission and display results on the Challenge leaderboard. Track 3 participants are eligible for a special award pool, which is smaller than the main award pool.</p>
<p>1st - $3,000; 2nd - $2,500; 3rd - $2,000; 4th - $1,500; 5th - $1,000</p>
<p>All tracks are eligible for follow-on acquisition opportunities. For more detail on submission tracks and requirements</p>
