<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>The Deep Space Food Challenge seeks to create novel food production technologies or systems that require minimal inputs and maximize safe, nutritious, and palatable food outputs for long-duration space missions, and which has a potential to benefit people on Earth.</p>

<p>NASA and CSA are focused on how to provide crew members with a viable food system for all long duration planetary missions, specifically an integrated solution providing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All daily nutritional needs</li>
  <li>A variety of palatable and safe food choices</li>
  <li>Acceptable, safe and quick preparation methods</li>
  <li>Limited resource requirements and no dependency on direct periodic resupply from Earth over durations increasing from months to years</li>
</ul>

<p>NASA and CSA will need to provide its crew members with nutritional foods they will want to eat and enjoy eating within all of the constraints of current technology for life away from Earth. NASA must also ensure that the process to create, grow, and/or prepare the food is not time consuming and unpleasant. Although there are many food systems on Earth that may offer benefits to space travelers, the ability of these systems to meet spaceflight demands has not yet been established.</p>

<p>The Deep Space Food Challenge will seek to meet these needs by identifying and fostering the development and demonstration of novel technologies, systems, and/or approaches for food production for long duration space exploration missions.</p>

<p>Additionally, food insecurity is a significant, chronic problem on Earth in both urban and rural communities.  Disasters that disrupt supply chains, on which all people depend, further aggravate food shortages. Developing compact and innovative advanced food system solutions could have applications in home and community-based local food production, providing new solutions for humanitarian responses to floods and droughts, and new technologies for rapid deployment following disasters.</p>

<h3 id="prizes">Prizes</h3>

<p><strong>Total Cash Prize Pool</strong></p>

<p>Phase 1 of the Deep Space Food Challenge is a prize competition with a total prize purse made up of $500,000 USD, (five hundred thousand United States dollars) and $300,000 CAD (three hundred thousand Canadian dollars) to be awarded to competitor teams for the design of novel food production technologies for long duration space exploration missions.</p>

<p><strong>Prize Breakdown</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>NASA Prize Purse for U.S. Teams</em></strong></p>

<p>Up to 20 top scoring U.S. Teams that achieve a score in five or more of the scoring categories will receive $25,000 USD each from NASA and be invited to compete in Phase 2 (should Phase 2 open for competition).  Teams must meet the eligibility requirements for the NASA Prize in order to be eligible to receive a prize from NASA.</p>

<p><strong><em>CSA Prize Purse for Canadian Teams</em></strong></p>

<p>Up to 10 top scoring Canadian Teams will receive $30,000 CAD each from CSA and be invited to compete in Phase 2 (should Phase 2 open for competition).  Teams must meet the eligibility requirements for the CSA Prize in order to be eligible to receive a prize from CSA.</p>

<p><strong>Non-monetary Prizes</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Recognition for Other International Teams</em></strong></p>

<p>The 10 top scoring Teams will be recognized as Challenge winners. Teams must meet the eligibility requirements for participating in the Challenge.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Eligibility requirements may vary between the NASA and CSA</p>

<h3 id="judging-criteria">Judging Criteria</h3>

<p><strong>Judging Panel</strong></p>

<p>The Deep Space Food Challenge will have distinct Judging Panels for U.S. and Canadian Teams; and a combined Judging Panel for Other International Teams.  The Judging Panels will communicate and collaborate throughout the entirety of the Challenge.</p>

<p>Following the Phase 1 submission deadline, the Judging Panels will review the submissions and discuss, evaluate, and rank the entries. Each Judging Panel has discretion in the assessment and scoring of submissions and in recommending the winners. NASA and CSA will review the recommendations from their respective Judging Panels, validate the recommendations as required by their Agency, and select final winners for awards.</p>

<p><strong>Judging Criteria</strong></p>

<p>The Judging Panels will evaluate designs according to the criteria defined on page 14 of the Official Rules Document (<a href="https://www.deepspacefoodchallenge.org">www.deepspacefoodchallenge.org)</a>.</p>

<p>The criteria categories include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Overall Criteria:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Adherence to Constraints</li>
      <li>Design Approach and Innovation</li>
      <li>Scientific and Technical Merit</li>
      <li>Feasibility of Design</li>
      <li>Terrestrial Potential</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Performance Criteria:</p>

    <ul>
