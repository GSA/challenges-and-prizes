I"C<p>The U.S. Department of Education has launched the Career and Technical Education (CTE) Makeover Challenge that calls upon eligible high schools to design models of makerspaces that strengthen career and technical skills through making.  Makerspaces are places that provide resources, materials, and equipment for students to conceive, create, collaborate, and learn through making.  Making and CTE both bring a hands-on learning approach that encourages students to imagine, create, tinker, and learn through the process of manufacturing, testing, and demonstrating their ideas.  Through making, CTE educators enable students to immerse themselves in problem-solving and the continuous refinement of their products while learning essential 21st-century career skills, such as critical thinking, planning, and communication.  The Department is seeking models of CTE makerspaces across a wide range of facility types, such as classrooms, libraries, and mobile spaces, that it can share with educators to encourage the creation of affordable, scalable, and replicable makerspaces.</p>
