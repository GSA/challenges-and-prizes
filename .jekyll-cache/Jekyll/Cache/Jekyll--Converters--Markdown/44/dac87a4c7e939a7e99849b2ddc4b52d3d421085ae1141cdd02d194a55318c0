I"É#<p>Are you good at creating user-friendly mobile apps for smartphones? Do you like to make a positive difference in the lives of others and in our nation‚Äôs communities? Then we‚Äôre looking for you to work on this challenge! Just as there are apps to help people with diabetes manage their disease, people in recovery from opioid use disorder could benefit from an app that provides features and information that support their recovery.</p>
<p>Addiction is a chronic brain disease. Those who suffer from a substance use disorder need help to change their behavior and learn new strategies to maintain health. They can get this help with treatment‚Äîwith the care of doctors and substance use disorders treatment providers. Treatment can help people stop using substances. It helps them get through withdrawal and cope with cravings. Treatment also helps address other harmful behaviors that are not conducive to recovery.</p>
<p>Just as important, treatment helps people address life issues they might have that can trigger relapse, such as feelings of low self-worth, a bad situation at work or home, a co-occurring mental disorder, or spending time with people who use drugs. In short, treatment helps people move into healthy lifestyles‚Äîinto a new way of living which is referred to as recovery.</p>
<p>Treatment may include medication. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is treatment that includes the use of medication along with counseling and other types of support. Treatment that includes medication-assisted treatment is an important option for opioid use disorder. Medication-assisted treatment can reduce problems of withdrawal and craving. Research also shows maintenance treatment typically leads to reduction or cessation of illicit opioid use and its adverse consequences, including cellulitis, hepatitis, and HIV infection from use of nonsterile injection equipment, as well as criminal behavior associated with obtaining drugs. These changes can give the person the chance to focus on the lifestyle changes that lead back to healthy living.¬† People in outpatient MAT could benefit from a mobile app for smartphones that provides features and information that supports their maintenance in recovery.</p>
<p>Below are some ideas and information on the insights regarding what patients receiving MAT might need, and what an app like this might do to respond to those insights. There are some required features and resources that must be included in the final product we‚Äôve provided them in the¬†<a href="https://challenges.s3.amazonaws.com/ABT/Challenge%20Assets%20_FINAL%20APPROVED.xlsx" target="_blank">assets</a> file. <em>The rest is up to you.</em> We ask you to be creative and innovative, and to develop a good user experience. You might want to collaborate with an existing recovery tool already on the market, or think of a recovery-related use to an existing tool.</p>
<p>What does someone in recovery from opioid use disorder need and what type of mobile app could you create?</p>
<p><br /><strong>Here‚Äôs insight one:</strong> Since medication-assisted treatment is likely an important part of an individual‚Äôs recovery, patients may need drug interaction and side effect information for methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone that they can access on their own, 24/7. For instance, an individual may have started methadone treatment a couple of days ago but is suddenly feeling some side effects and can‚Äôt reach a doctor to ask them about these side effects. With the app, they can look up side effects, how long they might last, and what else they can anticipate ‚Äì all via the privacy of their smartphone.    <br /><strong>Insight two</strong>: Patients receiving MAT need education and psychoeducational materials for opioid recovery support, such as how to manage their time; information on parenting skills; and the effects of drug use on their family. Perhaps they haven‚Äôt told their friends yet that they‚Äôre receiving MAT, and aren‚Äôt sure how to go about it. Access to information that explains to friends and family what MAT is and how it helps with recovery could be made available, or shared with a friend, via their smartphone.    While a person receiving MAT has a doctor, case manager, and addiction counselor, the provider may not have enough time in an appointment to provide all of the resources that a patient may need. A patient could use a one-stop shop for psycho-educational resources that provide tips, facts, and worksheets on how to deal with common issues and concerns that occur in opioid recovery, such as problems sleeping; dealing with drug triggers; avoiding relapse; dealing with guilt; managing time, life, money, and emotions; repairing relationships; and dealing with other health issues. Having these resources on a smartphone ‚Äì a tool many people carry with them everywhere ‚Äì means that they are available for use and referral in down time, waiting time, or crisis time.   <br /> <strong>Insight three</strong> is related to relapse prevention ‚Äì an important component of recovery. One of the main ways to prevent relapse is getting involved in healthy activities - replacing unhealthy habits with new habits that have emotional, physical, and/or social wellness benefits, such as participating in peer support groups, and exercise. An app feature that helps patients find local recovery support meetings easily and anonymously, or online peer support groups they could access via their phone ‚Äì would put recovery support at their fingertips. The second important component of relapse prevention is being aware and avoiding triggers for drug use. Triggers could be certain people, places, or situations. Perhaps a feature that reminds patients, via a call or text when a trigger is present would be useful ‚Äì to help keep their recovery at the forefront of their awareness.    <br /><strong>Insight four</strong> describes how individuals in MAT need support in relapse prevention such as warning signs, trigger alerts, and motivations for recovery. Could recovery motivation reminders in a calendar tool, with links to personal motivations ‚Äì such as photos of family, friends, pets, or goals ‚Äì help patients stay focused on their reasons for recovery? Could a trigger response feature be created with contacts when a person needs support? Perhaps they could link other motivational materials to reminders ‚Äì like links to inspiring YouTube videos, songs, talks/podcasts, fitness links, memes, or photos from their photo gallery. Another important component of relapse prevention is being aware and avoiding triggers for drug use. Triggers could be certain people, places, or situations. Perhaps a feature that reminds patients, via a call or text when a trigger is present would be useful ‚Äì to help keep their recovery at the forefront of their awareness.    <br /><strong>Insight five</strong> shows that Individuals in MAT maintenance are often juggling their work, personal, and treatment schedules. Maintaining recovery means finding new ways to live a healthy lifestyle just as other individuals with chronic health conditions must do.¬† How could an app help with this? Could a time management tool, with daily reminders for doctor, counselor, and treatment appointments help?    &lt;p&gt;So here is the Challenge‚Ä¶SAMHSA would like the development of a free, opioid recovery focused and user friendly <em>Opioid Recovery Support app</em> available to patients in recovery who are receiving outpatient medication-assisted treatment. Any features, tools, or¬†<a href="https://challenges.s3.amazonaws.com/ABT/Challenge%20Assets%20_FINAL%20APPROVED.xlsx" target="_blank">assets</a> in the app need to be tied to the insights provided, because the insights came from evidence-based practices, which means that they‚Äôve been proven effective through practice and research.    Interested in making a difference? There are already several recovery support, time management, and sobriety helper apps on the market that do some of the things we‚Äôve mentioned above but may not be specific to opioid recovery or address the insights of this challenge. You may want you partner with them to develop a version that meets the requirements of this challenge. Or you can develop a brand new app that responds to the insights and delivers the required features and resources in a robust and user-focused format? Don‚Äôt forget to read the <a href="https://challenges.s3.amazonaws.com/ABT/Challenge%20Assets%20_FINAL%20APPROVED.xlsx" target="_blank">Rules and Requirements</a>, because they have important additional information you need in order to participate. Whether you update an existing recovery support app or develop an entirely new one, SAMHSA wants you to submit your solutions!
