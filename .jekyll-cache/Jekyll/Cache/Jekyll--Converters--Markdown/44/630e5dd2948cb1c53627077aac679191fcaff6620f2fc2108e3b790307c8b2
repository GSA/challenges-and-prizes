I"a<p><strong>First Place - R. Jason Cronk and Professor Daniel J. Solove</strong></p>
<p>$20,000.00</p>
<p>Jason Cronk and Professor Daniel J. Solove&rsquo;s generator (https://github.com/privacymaverick/mpn-generator) features a side-by-side, live-updating view allowing application developers to see the MPN as they complete the app&rsquo;s sections. It also clearly shows the developer which sections are completed or require more information. The MPN most successfully combines the clarity and simplicity of a nutrition facts-type label with visual icons that aid comprehension of the privacy concepts. Cronk and Solove best specified which terms and language were changed to enhance consumer understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Second Place - 1upHealth</strong></p>
<p>$10,000.00</p>
<p>1upHealth&rsquo;s team (https://github.com/rickysahu/mpngen) uses a side-by-side view that includes live checking of entered information to verify websites and phone number formats. The generated MPN allows for extensive customization, available in HTML, JSON, and Markdown formats. Detailed interviews and usability testing were held to receive consumer feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Third Place - MadeClear.io</strong></p>
<p>$5,000.00</p>
<p>MadeClear.io&rsquo;s generator (https://github.com/ajveach/MadeClear) features expandable headers allowing developers to easily see how far they have progressed in completing the MPN. The MPN uses alternating background images that help differentiate the sections and colorful icons that add context to the privacy language. The team&rsquo;s consumer testing included surveys completed by 30 individuals.</p>
