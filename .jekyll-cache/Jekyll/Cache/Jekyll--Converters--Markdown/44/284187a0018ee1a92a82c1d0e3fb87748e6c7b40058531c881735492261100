<p>New technologies, including wearable interfaces like heads up displays, smart watches, and biological monitors have the potential to increase first responder safety while enhancing performance. However, variability in current testing procedures/environments pose a challenge in assessing the effectiveness of emerging technologies. To assess the potential of new technologies and compare technologies against each other, NIST is crowdsourcing ideas that use virtual/immersive environments in conjunction with physical spaces to create accurate first responder scenarios and a repeatable test environment for technology evaluation.</p>
<ul> <li>Your job is to propose a physical environment, along with immersive virtual reality tools, to facilitate the future of first response in a controlled and repeatable way.</li> <li>Possible First Responder Scenarios, Metrics/ Data to be collected, and Technologies to be tested are included on the Resources Tab, provided by NIST.</li> <li>This is an ideation prize only and does not require the development of virtual or physical spaces, only proposals.</li> </ul>
<h4>Timeline</h4>
<ul> <li>Open to submissions:&nbsp; March 28, 2017</li> <li>Submission deadline:&nbsp; May 3, 2017 at 5 p.m. ET</li> <li>Judging:&nbsp; May 4 to June 11, 2017</li> <li>Crowd Voting:&nbsp; May 8 to May 19, 2017</li> <li>Winners Announced:&nbsp; June 12, 2017</li> </ul>
<h4>Prize</h4>
<p>NIST will award a grand total of <em>up to</em> $50,000 in overall cash prizes:</p>
<ul> <li>The guaranteed minimum prize amount, per finalist, will be $5,000</li> <li>Up to 5 competitors could share a $45,000 prize purse, as awarded by the judges</li> <li>A popular choice award of $5,000, determined by crowd voting, will be given following the submission deadline.</li> </ul>
