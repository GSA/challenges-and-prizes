I"x<h4>Judging Panel</h4>
<p>The Judging Panel will be composed of federal and/or non-federal scientists and other technical and subject matter experts.</p>
<h4>Judging Criteria</h4>
<p>Submitted ideas and solutions will be scored by performance using the following criteria with approximate weights noted in parentheses:</p>
<ul> <li>Readiness:&nbsp; How sufficiently developed is the idea? Do intended users have to develop other technologies or methods to apply the idea? Can it use “off the shelf” parts to carry out? (20%)</li> <li>Deployment Scale:&nbsp; Which geographic regions of the United States and Canada will the idea work in? Can it work in more than one region?  What kinds of bat habitats can the idea work in? Will it work in the presence and absence of Pd? (15%)</li> <li>Species Susceptibility:&nbsp; Will the idea work for the most highly susceptible bat species? (20%)</li> <li>Ease of Use:&nbsp; How easy is the idea to apply? For example, will carrying it out require significant physical exertion, extensive time in the field, highly trained scientists or other specialists, or significant safety training and precautions? (10%)</li> <li>Cost Efficiency:&nbsp; Submitted Solutions are not required to include a specific cost per bat to implement the idea, but do you have a sense of what it would cost to implement the idea? (10%)</li> <li>Efficacy:&nbsp; How effective is the treatment at the point of application to eliminate or weaken Pd to help bats survive? (25%)</li> <li>Risk to Resources:&nbsp; When used at the proposed scale, will the idea keep harm to native natural or cultural resources at a minimum? Solutions that the judges find help bats, but only at the expense of causing irreparable harm to natural or cultural resources near bat populations, or solutions that cause significant harm to bats themselves, will not be considered for winning this Challenge.</li> </ul>
