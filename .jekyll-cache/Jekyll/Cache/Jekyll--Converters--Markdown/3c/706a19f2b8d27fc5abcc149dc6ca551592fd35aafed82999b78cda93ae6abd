I"<p>Although the VA engages with over 9 million Veterans, there are currently 17.4 million Veterans in the United States. Even Veterans who do receive VA care may not be in regular contact. We want to ensure the VA serves all veterans, and there may be ways to promote well-being, enhance preventative care, predict future hospitalizations, or monitor chronic conditions for this population. All of these interventions are aimed at improving outcomes for our Veterans.</p>

<p>We invite interested solvers to participate in a three-month AI Tech Sprint. The sprint is an iterative prototyping process where outside teams will receive novel synthetic data and connect with health care providers, experts, and stakeholders from the Department of Veterans Affairs. We will work with each team to craft a suitable project that fits the team’s abilities and improves VA care. Teams will participate in weekly meetings with government experts and researchers, and monthly opportunities to demonstrate a prototype. The tech sprint culminates in a demo day, where participants receive recognition from the VA as well as $100,000 in total awards.</p>

<p>Select projects may also receive offers to pilot their product with VA hospitals, the largest health care system in the United States. We seek to establish collaborative public-private partnerships beyond the challenge window and facilitate the production of contract-ready solutions for improving Veterans’ care.</p>

<p>Applications are due Dec 16, 2020, with the tech sprint kickoff on Jan 4, 2021, and final demo day on April 2, 2021.</p>
