I"‰<p>WELCOME TO THE TRANSFORM TOX TESTING CHALLENGE</p>
<p>Out of thousands of chemicals in use today, very few have been fully evaluated for potential health risks.</p>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Institutes of Healthâ€™s (NIH) National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), and the National Toxicology Program (NTP), headquartered at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) are pleased to announce the upcoming launch of the Transform Tox Testing Challenge.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;p&gt;Scientists from EPA, NTP and NCATS have used high-throughput screening (HTS) assays to evaluate the potential health effects of thousands of chemicals. The Transform Tox Testing Challenge: Innovating for Metabolism is calling on innovative thinkers to find new ways to incorporate physiological levels of xenobiotic metabolism into HTS assays. Since current HTS assays do not fully incorporate xenobiotic metabolism, they may miss chemicals that are metabolized to a more toxic form. Adding metabolic competence to HTS assays will help researchers more accurately assess chemical effects and better protect human health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We are looking for innovative technological solutions to retrofit these assays to allow both chemicals and their metabolite products to be evaluated. With your help, we can transform chemical testing methods to make them more relevant to real life and more effective at predicting health effects.    &amp;nbsp;    Do you have a solution that could fill this critical gap in environmental science and technology?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the first stage of the Challenge, you are encouraged to submit your practical design for how HTS assays could be retrofitted to include xenobiotic metabolic competence. Your idea should be implementable but not necessarily ready for immediate widespread use. In Stage 1, up to 10 submissions will be selected as semi-finalists, awarded a prize of $10,000 each and invited to participate in the next stage of the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
