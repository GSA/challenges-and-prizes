<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;p&gt;The next Industrial Revolution is happening &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, and this is your opportunity to change its trajectory forever! Your participation in this challenge could directly affect the advancement of an entire industry, and subsequently our nation’s economic growth. Sounds daunting? We promise it isn’t. There is just a five page paper standing between you and big opportunities that will allow you to transform your future while transforming an industry. Not only are there incredible opportunities and cash prizes on the line (upwards of $10,500!), but the challenge could also serve as an impressive thesis, capstone or finals project. You have to do these projects for class anyway, you might as well make your mark on history while you’re at it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your challenge is to brainstorm and develop innovative and adaptable manufacturing intelligence, drawing from data acquired using the MTConnect standard. MTConnect is an open, XML- and HTTP-based communications standard that acts as the enabler for the Internet of Things for manufacturing by fostering improved connectivity and interoperability between manufacturing equipment and devices. Within the challenge itself— there are two separate competitions, and you can choose to participate in one or both.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;#1— Idea Creation: You must identify a manufacturing intelligence need, and build a business case for your proposed solution. Your solution must be written out, and including a cover page and 200 word abstract, &lt;em&gt;may not exceed five pages&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;#2— Applications: Read more about the Application Challenge &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/mtconnectstudentapps/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.
