<p>Reservoir sedimentation has become a significant problem with the aging of water storage facilities.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Reservoir sedimentation has become a significant problem with the aging of water storage facilities. This problem is a big deal because there are 90,580 dams listed in the National Inventory of Dams and 3,381 of those are owned by the Federal government (USACE, 2016). Sediment deposition in reservoirs limits the active life of reservoirs by reducing reservoir storage capacity for water supply or flood risk reduction. Sedimentation also impairs dam outlets, reservoir water intakes, water quality, and lake recreation, increases upstream ground water level and flood stage, and causes downstream degradation of habitat and erosion of infrastructure.</p>
<p>Most reservoirs are older than 50 years and many are older than 100 years. The sediment-design life (typically 50 or 100 years) will be reached when the sediment level at the dam is higher than the outlet and the outlet is prone to plugging by sediment and debris. Conventional temporary dredging has been used to remove sediment from some reservoirs, but it can be very expensive.&nbsp; Periodic pressure flushing with a full reservoir is another method used, but only removes a small amount of sediment around the dam outlet. Drawdown flushing can be effective through low-level outlets, but sacrifices the much needed water stored in the reservoir.&nbsp; Conventional dredging and flushing methods have shortcomings that reduce their applicability to large reservoirs designed for multi-year water storage, with relatively larger volumes of sediment that require removal.</p>
<p>This Challenge seeks new or improved techniques for reservoir sediment removal in a cost-effective manner that still preserves and sustains the operational objectives of reservoirs managed by the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In order to minimize future loss in reservoir storage capacity, the ideal solution would include effective, affordable, and environmentally acceptable methods of removing sediment that are implementable at Federal water storage facilities. Sediment removal includes the collection, transport, and delivery of sediment through or around a reservoir to the downstream river channel area. Off-stream beneficial uses of removed reservoir sediment are outside the scope of this prize competition. Solutions are needed for the removal of both fine sediment (clay &amp; silt) as well as coarse sediment (sand &amp; gravel).</p>
<p>Solutions are needed to facilitate long-term reservoir sediment management focused on maintaining the remaining reservoir storage capacity, rather than trying to recover past decades of storage loss.</p>
<h3>About the Collaborators</h3>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Federal Regulatory Commission, National Resources Conservation Service, and American Rivers are collaborating with Reclamation on various aspects of this Challenge such as design, technical review, judging, and promotion.</p>
<p>The mission of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is to deliver vital public and military engineering services; partnering in peace and war to strengthen our Nation&rsquo;s security, energize the economy and reduce risks from disasters (<a href="http://www.usace.army.mil">www.usace.army.mil</a>).</p>
<p>The mission of the Federal Regulatory Commission (FERC) is to assist consumers in obtaining reliable, efficient and sustainable energy services at a reasonable cost through appropriate regulatory and market means.</p>
<p>The mission of the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is to provide resources to farmers and landowners to aid them with conservation. Ensuring productive lands in harmony with a healthy environment is our priority.</p>
<p>The mission of the American Rivers is to protect healthy rivers, restore damaged rivers and conserve clean water for people and nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
