I"<p>Last summer 2013, the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (WHIAAPI) launched the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/edblogs/aapi/issue-areas/the-affordable-care-act/hey/">Healthy Engaged Youth (HEY!) Program,</a> encouraging young AAPI leaders to become Ambassadors by conducting outreach around the Affordable Care Act <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">(ACA)</a> within their campuses and communities.</p>
<p> This summer 2014, WHIAAPI is launching the E3! Program in order to “Educate, Engage, and Empower” young leaders to increase awareness and outreach around the following four issue areas: <b><a href="http://www.ed.gov/edblogs/aapi/education/">education,</a> <a href="http://www.ed.gov/edblogs/aapi/health/behavioral-health-and-aapis/">mental health,</a> <a href="http://www.ed.gov/edblogs/aapi/workforce-diversity/">pathways to public service,</a> </b> and <b><a href="http://www.ed.gov/edblogs/aapi/immigration/">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)</a>.</b>    </p>
<p>The mission of the WHIAAPI E3! Ambassador Program is to Educate, Engage, and Empower young leaders to increase awareness around critical issues facing the AAPI community and to highlight key federal programs and resources in which AAPIs may be underserved. Selected E3! Ambassadors are encouraged to conduct outreach within their campuses and communities – whether it’s setting up a table to share resources at a campus fair, facilitating a workshop during a conference, or even utilizing social media – with the goal of improving the quality of life and opportunity for young AAPIs.
