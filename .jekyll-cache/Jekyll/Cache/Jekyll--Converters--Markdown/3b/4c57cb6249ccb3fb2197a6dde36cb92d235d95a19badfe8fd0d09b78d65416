I"<h4><strong>STAGE 1 &ndash; ACTION PLAN SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</strong></h4>
<p>Eligible teams are required to submit a plan on challenge.gov by clicking on the "Submit Solution" tab on the Nutrient Sensor Action Challenge page. If you have not worked with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">www.challenge.gov</a>&nbsp;in the past, you will need to&nbsp;<strong>register</strong>&nbsp;on the site, and&nbsp;<strong>create an account</strong>. Click on the New to Challenge.gov Register for an account&nbsp;link to register in order to submit nominations for the Nutrient Sensor Action Challenge. There is no cost to register or participate in the Challenge. Complete the registration; you will need to activate the account you create within 24 hours (look for an email to activate the account) in order to submit a nomination. Action plans must address the components listed below (<strong>A - G</strong>) Deadline &ndash; The submission must be available on Challenge.gov for evaluation by <strong>September 20, 2017</strong> <strong>at 11:59 PM ET&nbsp;</strong>for judging. &nbsp;Applications submitted via regular mail, facsimile, or email will not be accepted.&nbsp;No additions or modifications to the submissions will be accepted after the submission deadline. Applications must be submitted in English. Preferred file formats are .pdf, .doc, or .docx. Submissions must be no longer than 10 pages, (Times New Roman, size 12, single-spaced) and must address the information requested. Limit 1 plan per team.</p>
<h4><strong>A.&nbsp;Nutrient Issue:&nbsp; </strong></h4>
<p>Describe the nutrient-related topic or need that will be addressed by the addition of data and information from continuous nutrient sensors. Describe how data from continuous sensors will be incorporated into your monitoring operations. Explain how nutrient sensors will enable improved decision-making for nutrient reduction.</p>
<h4><strong>B. Team</strong>:</h4>
<p>Identify the team that will be working on the challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Lead:</strong> Provide the name and contact information for the team lead. The team lead serves as the primary point of contact and may participate on only one Nutrient Sensors Action Challenge team.</p>
<p><strong>Members:</strong>&nbsp; Describe team member and roles and responsibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of team members is not limited. &nbsp;Teams should include expertise in:</p>
<p>- Water quality monitoring</p>
<p>- Data Management / Information technology</p>
<p>- Communication</p>
<p>- Data Analytics</p>
<p>- Continuous Nutrient Sensors&nbsp;<strong><em>(</em></strong><a href="http://www.act-us.info/nutrients-challenge/Participants.php"><em><strong>Click here </strong></em></a>&nbsp;for a list of participants from the 2014<em>&nbsp;</em><em>Nutrient Sensor Challenge</em>)</p>
<h4><strong>C. Current Monitoring</strong>:</h4>
<p>Describe current water quality monitoring efforts, locations and assets including links to any relevant websites, data or publications.</p>
<h4><strong>D.&nbsp;Sensors and monitoring:&nbsp; </strong></h4>
<p>Please provide plans for sensor deployment that includes placement of sensors, power considerations, sensor maintenance, telemetry, calibration, sampling regime etc. Teams must plan on deploying <strong><em>2 or more</em> </strong>low-cost (less than $15k each) continuous nutrient sensors.</p>
<h4><strong>E. Data:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>1. Solution Architecture:</strong>&nbsp;Provide a diagram which illustrates the overall configuration of the proposed data solution. The diagram should provide information about how data is taken from the sensor and loaded into the data storage and how the data repository will be accessed for judging (e.g. web services)</p>
<p><strong>2. QA/QC</strong>:&nbsp; Describe how quality assurance and data validation will be addressed</p>
<p><strong>3. Data Sharing</strong>:&nbsp; Teams are required to make the sensor data accessible for judging using web services that follow Open Geospatial Consortium data standards for communicating and sharing continuous monitoring data. (<a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sos">www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sos</a>, <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/waterml">www.opengeospatial.org/standards/waterml</a>). &nbsp;Describe any additional plans for sharing data.</p>
<p><strong>4. Metadata</strong>:&nbsp;Teams are expected to provide metadata that will explain the data content. &nbsp; Describe your metadata approach and identify and describe the naming convention for characterizing the nutrient data. &nbsp; Teams may consider using one of the formats below:</p>
<p>- NOAA/IOOS metadata standards and SOS guidelines:&nbsp;<a href="http://ioos.github.io/sos-guidelines/">http://ioos.github.io/sos-guidelines/</a></p>
<p>- NWQMC Water Quality Data Elements:&nbsp; a user's guide:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ioos.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/national_water_quality_monitoring_council_elements.pdf">https://www.ioos.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/national_water_quality_monitoring_council_elements.pdf</a></p>
<h4><strong>F. Analytics and Interpretation</strong><strong>:&nbsp; </strong></h4>
<p>Describe plans for analyzing the data and if there are specific analytical and statistical tools (e.g. platforms, algorithms, models) that you anticipate using. Please describe how these analytics will provide insight and support use of the data and information.</p>
<h4><strong>G.&nbsp;Communication and Use</strong><strong>:</strong></h4>
<p>Please describe plans communicating the data and information for use by decision-makers. Describe how the data and information will be integrated with existing water quality data to improve decisions about nutrient reduction.</p>
<h4><strong>FAQs &amp; SUPPLEMENTAL RESOURCES</strong></h4>
<p>Review a list of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.act-us.info/nutrients-challenge/Download/FAQs_Resources_8_2_17.pdf">FAQs&nbsp;</a>as well as added resources to get started. <em>Please direct any requests for clarifications and additional information about this challenge to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:NutrientSensorActionChallenge@erg.com">NutrientSensorActionChallenge@erg.com</a>. &nbsp;ERG will contact the federal partners, as needed, to answer your questions and will also make the responses available to all registered solvers if they provide relevant additional information.</em></p>
