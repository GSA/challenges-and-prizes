I"¸<p>Challenge participants are encouraged to submit any idea that could improve and benefit the authorization process. No idea is too small!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants should submit their idea to <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a> by 5pm EDT August 22, 2019 with the subject line:&ldquo;FedRAMP Challenge Response.&rdquo; Submissions should be no more than two pages, 11 point Arial font, attached to the message as a PDF or Word document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responses should include brief details on your relationship to FedRAMP, such as how you would identify yourself (CSP, 3PAO, Agency, Industry, Interested Citizen, or other). All approaches to this challenge are welcome, but here is an optional outline to organize your response:&nbsp;</p>
<ol> <li>Clearly identify and describe the improvement/initiative</li> <li>Detail existing challenges the improvement/initiative addresses</li> <li>Provide a technical or management approach to implementing the idea&nbsp;</li> <li>Identify resources required for idea implementation and sustainment (e.g. level of effort, expertise needed, tooling, etc.)</li> <li>Describe intended outcomes of implementing the idea</li> <li>Develop and list metrics to successfully monitor and manage initiative post implementation&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ol>
<p>Given the increasing capabilities of technology and innovative services, it is our expectation that new ideas can propose improvements in ways that continue or improve security rigor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Submissions will be reviewed by the FedRAMP PMO. As a result of this challenge and internal efforts, FedRAMP will define its next big move as a program and communicate the results of this effort through the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/blog/">Focus on FedRAMP blog</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of a larger coordinated effort, the PMO will also release a Special Announcement on FedBizOpps in addition to this posting on Challenge.gov in order to gather ideas from the broadest possible community. These public announcements will contain a direct link to this page for further details about the ideation challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your effort and commitment to partnering with FedRAMP to improve cybersecurity for all.</p>
