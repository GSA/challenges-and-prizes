<p><strong>Challenge Overview</strong></p>

<p>The American-Made Perovskite Startup Prize is a $3 million prize competition designed to accelerate the growth of the U.S. perovskite industry and support the rapid development of solar cells and modules that use perovskite materials. Through two contests, established perovskite researchers will launch a company and move toward commercialization in under a year.</p>

<p>As part of the American-Made Challenges series, the Perovskite Startup Prize unites the world‚Äôs best-in-class research base with the unparalleled entrepreneurial support system of the¬†<a href="https://americanmadechallenges.org/network/index.html">American-Made Network</a>. Consisting of pioneering maker spaces, dozens of energy incubators, universities, and 17 U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories, the Network is primed to assist entrepreneurs in bringing perovskite-focused concepts to market.</p>

<p><strong>Prize Contests</strong></p>

<p>The Perovskite Startup Prize consists of two consecutive contests that accelerate efforts to develop new, innovative perovskite solar companies with the potential to manufacture commercially viable products in the United States. The best-performing competitors in the Countdown Contest are awarded with cash prizes and are eligible to compete in the Lift-off Contest. This cycle of contests repeats until 2-3 final winners are selected for successfully completing the challenge.</p>

<h3 id="prizes"><strong>Prizes</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Total Cash Prize Pool</strong></p>

<p>The total prize pool for these two contests is $3 million. Winners will receive up to $700,000 in cash prizes and $100,000 in technical support vouchers.</p>

<p><strong>Prize Breakdown</strong></p>

<p>The Two Contests:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Countdown Contest</strong> ‚Äì This contest will reward world-class teams, with high-quality perovskite technology platforms, that form new companies with a clear and credible plan to resolve critical business and technical risks. Only new, for-profit companies‚Äîwhose date of incorporation is within six months prior to the announcement of this competition or any time after the announcement of the competition‚Äîare eligible to compete. DOE expects to select approximately six to nine companies that will receive $200,000 in cash and become eligible to compete in the Liftoff Contest. It is not expected that all winners will be selected in the first open-application period; the Countdown Contest has a rolling application period with quarterly submission deadlines. Participant submissions will be reviewed quarterly by a panel of expert reviewers from industry, the national laboratories, and the government. Participants who are not selected will be given feedback and encouraged to resubmit in future open-application periods. The DOE will announce when the Countdown Contest is over.</li>
  <li><strong>Liftoff Contest</strong> ‚Äì This contest will reward the achievement of substantial technical progress toward goals set in the Countdown Contest, while simultaneously establishing the critical business and research infrastructure the company will need to be successful. Only winners of the Countdown Contest may compete in the Liftoff Contest. Winners of the Countdown Contest are eligible to apply to the Liftoff Contest within 12 months of winning the Countdown prize. Over the length of this prize competition, DOE expects to select approximately two to three companies that will receive $500,000 in cash and $100,000 in vouchers redeemable at national laboratories and qualified service providers. Liftoff Contest competitors who do not win on their first attempt will have one more opportunity to apply to compete in the Liftoff Contest within 15 months of winning the Countdown prize. Competitors who are not selected twice or are outside of these time windows will not be eligible to compete for the Liftoff prize. The Liftoff Contest will end when the prize pool is exhausted, regardless of whether all Countdown winners have applied to enter the Liftoff Contest. Liftoff Contest submissions will be reviewed quarterly by a panel of expert reviewers from industry, the national laboratories, and the government.</li>
