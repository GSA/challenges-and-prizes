<p>If multiple technologies of similar type or category are submitted, the review panel may choose the most advantageous solution(s) within each type or category to continue competing in the prize challenge. The Government selection may be based on the highest scored participant solution that has the most innovative concept or unique capabilities for each type or category. In doing so, the Government may, at its discretion, select a participant that scored lower points than an unselected participant of a different type or category. The Prize Selection Decision will be a subjective evaluation of all entries for each phase at completion of this challenge.</p>
