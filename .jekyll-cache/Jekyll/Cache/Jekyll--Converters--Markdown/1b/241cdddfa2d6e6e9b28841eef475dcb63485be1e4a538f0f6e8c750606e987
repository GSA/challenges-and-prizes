<p>Engineering-based results are acceptable, but true metered data is preferred. The submission will be evaluated, in part, on the magnitude of the energy and energy cost savings. Please detail any impacts beyond the direct energy savings from the projects (increased awareness and engagement, replicability for other plants, auxiliary benefits beyond energy savings).</p>

<h4 id="initiativeleadership---30">Initiative/Leadership - <strong>30%</strong></h4>

<p>Participants should show how their actions made the process or facility more energy efficient or increased productivity since when the project was completed (no earlier than Nov 1, 2017). Participants are encouraged to add in personal anecdotes such as how working with and engaging other plant manufacturing staff increased energy savings were realized and how the action will continue to lead to savings. In addition, please share content about the facility and the energy-related components of the project (e.g., why it was selected/implemented? How does it fit into a broader sustainability strategy?), what was the process for identifying the opportunity, defining the project, and deciding to proceed? Also, describe what your organizationâ€™s goal or desired outcomes for the project, barrier(s) to implementation and what were your solution(s) to implementing the project? Please detail the extent to which the individual had to overcome significant obstacles (e.g., economic, technological, management support, etc.) to implement the project. Please explain, to the extent possible, how the project or practice described in the submission catalyzed greater engagement amongst other employees at the company.</p>

<h4 id="innovation---20">Innovation - <strong>20%</strong></h4>

<p>Please articulate how this represents a new way of doing business for the individual, plant or the manufacturer. Where applicable, please describe the new technology and the impact it is having. How imaginative or creative is the practice or project? How replicable is the project?</p>
