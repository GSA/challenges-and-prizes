If the Entry includes any third party works (such as third party content or open source code), You must provide the Competition Sponsor with all appropriate licenses and releases for such third party works. In the event You cannot provide all such required licenses and releases, the Competition Sponsor reserves the right, in the Competition Sponsor’s sole discretion, to disqualify the applicable Entry.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  <strong>7.5</strong>     You may participate by registering, but You may not register more than one true and uniform identity; multiple registrations for a participant using multiple identities are not allowed. NASA and/or RAMPIT reserve the right to disqualify any Entry made by a participant violating this limitation, regardless of whether all of the respective parties had knowledge of such violation. You may only submit one Entry.    <strong>7.6</strong>      The application requirements for your Entry are clearly described on this website. Your Entry will be assessed initially by five reviewers, who will be assigned to score your Entry either randomly or after considering any potential conflicts of interest, using the scoring rubric and any other judging criteria that are also described on this website. In cases where a Judge indicates any potential conflict of interest, the Entry will be assigned to another Judge. Those Judges, each of whom is named on this website, will be responsible for scoring your Entry. The Selection Committee judges are permitted to communicate with Participants solely for the purposes of carrying out due diligence for evaluating your Entry and assigning a score during the review process, but those Judges are not required to contact directly any individual. The judging criteria are to be applied in the sole discretion of the Judges. By participating in the Earth &amp; Space Air Prize, You acknowledge and agree to be bound by the final decision of the Judges.    <strong>7.7</strong>      Once a rank order of Entries has been calculated, the top three Competitors will be named as Finalists. Finalists will be asked to attend a one-week demonstration period, currently scheduled for the week of October 2, 2018, where they will present and test their prototype. Finalists may be asked to prepare additional materials in advance or upon the date of the event or shortly thereafter. You will be required to respond to any invitations to attend any events as promptly and as clearly as possible. If a Finalist is unable to attend the demonstration, then they may forfeit their award, and the next Competitor in the rank order of Entries may be named a Finalist in their place.    <strong>7.8</strong>     The Selection Committee will be present during the demonstration period to review and discuss the Finalists’ prototypes and will determine the Winner using judging criteria that may not incorporate the same scoring rubric employed by the previous assessment.    <strong>7.9</strong>      While RAMPIT, LLC (“RAMPIT”) is providing an online platform for your participation, RAMPIT is not responsible for the payment of any Award(s). Payment of any Award(s) is the sole responsibility of NASA and its designees, and under the Terms each participant has agreed to look solely to NASA, as the Competition Sponsor, for the payment of any Award.    <strong>7.10</strong>     By submitting your Entry, you agree to release, discharge and hold harmless NASA, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, The Common Pool, LLC, and RAMPIT and their partners, affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising agencies, agents and their employees, officers, directors and representatives from any Loss arising out of your participation in Competition and the acceptance and use, misuse, or possession of any Award(s).

In the event of a dispute about the identity of any Competitor, an online registration will be declared as if made by the authorized account holder of the e-mail address submitted at time of entry.    <strong>7.11</strong>    THIS COMPETITION IS VOID WHERE PROHIBITED. Competitors agree that this Competition shall be subject to and governed by the laws of the United States of America and the forum of any dispute shall be in the courts of the United States of America.    <strong>7.12</strong>     If for any reason Competition is not capable of running as planned, due to infection by computer virus, bugs, worms, Trojan horses, denial of service, tampering, unauthorized intervention, fraud, technical failures or any other causes beyond the control of RAMPIT that corrupt or affect the administration, security, fairness, integrity, or proper conduct of this Competition, RAMPIT reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to disqualify any individual(s) who tamper with the process, and/or to cancel, terminate, modify, or suspend the Competition. If NASA and/or RAMPIT terminates the Competition, it will not retain any rights in the submitted Entries.    <strong>7.13</strong>    The Competition Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any Competitor who is found to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Earth &amp; Space Air Prize, to be acting in violation of these Rules, or to be acting in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner, or with the intent to disrupt or undermine the legitimate operation of the Earth &amp; Space Air Prize, or to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any other person.    <strong>7.14</strong>     Entry into the Earth &amp; Space Air Prize does not constitute entry into any other NASA competition, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Competition, RAMPIT competition, or promotion that may be offered by the Competition Sponsor and/or its affiliates.    <strong>7.15</strong>      NASA and/or RAMPIT reserves the right to disqualify any participant who violates these RULES, the Terms and any standards of behavior expressed or implied in them.    <strong>7.16</strong>       The names of the Finalists and Winner will be posted on this website for such period of time as the Competition Sponsor deems reasonable.          </p>
