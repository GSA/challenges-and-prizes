<p>The Remote Pregnancy Monitoring Challenge will award $375,000 in prizes to support the creation of tech innovations to help prenatal care providers remotely monitor the health and wellbeing of pregnant women, as well as place health data into the hands of pregnant women themselves as a tool to monitor their own health and make informed decisions about care. Solutions would especially benefit women who live in rural and medically underserved areas who have limited access to on-site prenatal care.</p>
<p>Many women who are low-income in both rural and urban communities face barriers in accessing prenatal care. And once pregnant, conflicting priorities such as work, child care, and transportation make it difficult to make the approximately 15 recommended prenatal visits to their provider's office, which include critical medical assessments and instructions about self-care. This Challenge is designed to make technology work for pregnant women by increasing access to care, improving communications between patients and providers and across providers, and empowering pregnant women to take charge of their health and their care.</p>
