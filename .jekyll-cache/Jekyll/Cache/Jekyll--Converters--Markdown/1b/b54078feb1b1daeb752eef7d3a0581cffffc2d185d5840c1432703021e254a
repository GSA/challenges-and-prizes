<p>This year, we‚Äôve been forced to rethink the myriad of different ways we connect, socialize and interact with each other. In the absence of face-to-face time, can technology and online tools help us make, maintain,  and strengthen those connections so vital to everyday life? We believe they can. That‚Äôs why we need your help.</p>

<p>Can you design an easy-to-use online directory of social engagement programs and technology tools and products that matches end-users who are socially isolated with customized suggestions, tailored to meet their specific needs, interests, and abilities, in one seamless end-to-end experience? Then we want to hear from you.</p>

<p>The Administration for Community Living (ACL) along with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), components of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, are offering up to $750,000 in prizes and an opportunity to reach up to 10 million Americans. The prize will be awarded to the winner at the CES in January 2021. ACL and OASH are joined by the Consumer Technology Association Foundation (CTA Foundation), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in promoting the competition and judging and/or evaluating the submissions.</p>

<h4 id="backgroundissue">Background/Issue</h4>

<p>The number of people in the United States aged 65 or older will almost double from 49 million in 2020 to 95 million by the year 2060 comprising nearly one quarter of the total US population. Among the senior population, nearly 25% of Americans aged 65-and-over are considered to be socially isolated - ‚Äúthe objective state of having few social relationships or infrequent social contact with others‚Äù - while 43% of those 60-and-over report feeling lonely.</p>

<p>A constellation of harmful health outcomes have been associated with isolation and loneliness including premature mortality, a higher risk for developing dementia, heart failure and stroke, and increased risk of hospitalizations. In light of these health risk factors, it is unsurprising that analyses of Medicare spending has revealed an additional $6.7 billion spent annually on enrollees who are socially isolated.</p>

<p>Recognizing the importance in fostering the development of innovative solutions to combat the harmful effects of these risk factors and the role technology has in addressing social isolation and loneliness, in March 2019, the White House National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) released a report on ‚ÄúEmerging Technologies to Support an Aging Population.‚Äù</p>

<p>The challenges brought forth by social isolation and loneliness has come to the fore during the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  As the nation continues to adhere to public health recommendations of social distancing, an increasingly recognized secondary outcome is the risk social distancing can have on rates of loneliness and social isolation especially among our nation‚Äôs most vulnerable populations including older adults, persons with disabilities living alone, as well as those who live in care facilities and group homes and our nation‚Äôs Veterans population.</p>

<h4 id="purpose">Purpose</h4>

<p>While there are an array of technologies and social engagement programs in the marketplace, there are considerable gaps in both awareness of and access to these technologies and programming for those individuals most likely to be lonely and isolated. Consequently, there is an opportunity to increase access and awareness to technologies and social engagement programming.</p>

<p>ACL and OASH are pleased to announce the <strong>M</strong>obilizing and <strong>E</strong>mpowering the <strong>N</strong>ation and <strong>T</strong>echnology to <strong>A</strong>ddress <strong>L</strong>oneliness &amp; social isolation (MENTAL) Health Innovation Challenge to address this need. Supporting partners include the VA, FCC, and the CTA Foundation.</p>

<p>With this health innovation challenge we hope to recognize innovative ideas and solutions that seek to develop a software platform that increases awareness of, access to and use of social engagement technologies and programming to help curtail the impact of loneliness and social isolation.</p>

<h4 id="subject-and-scope-of-prize-competition">Subject and Scope of Prize Competition</h4>

<p>The MENTAL Health Innovation Challenge asks care partners, local communities, businesses, non-profit organizations, institutions, healthcare providers, technologists, academics, among others in the global community for innovative solutions to combat loneliness and social isolation in vulnerable populations including Veterans, older adults, persons with disabilities living alone, racial and ethnic minority populations, as well as those who live in care facilities and group homes that may be isolated from visitors and family members during a quarantine.</p>

<p>The goal of this challenge is to increase consumer awareness and use of technology tools that keep older adults, people with disabilities, racial and minority populations, and Veterans socially engaged and connected to families, friends, communities and activities of interest. The Challenge is seeking solutions that assess socially isolated individuals and match them with appropriate technology tools and social engagement programming that best meet their needs. The winning solution will become part of a public-private campaign to reach up to 10 million socially isolated older adults, people with disabilities, racial and minority populations and Veterans. Successful solutions will build from existing assessments, technology tools, and utilize state of the art matching algorithms to address the following topic area:</p>

<p><strong>Topic Area: Increase Awareness and Use of Technology and Social Engagement Programming Through an Accessible Social Engagement Clearinghouse</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an accessible technology and social engagement clearinghouse that catalogs and links the array of technology, apps and social engagement programming resources.</li>
  <li>Allow consumers to be matched to appropriate technology tools and programs based on their identified needs, interests, and abilities. This will require the design of a consumer interface and a user friendly assessment process that can inform the development of algorithms to match individuals to technology tools and social engagement programming that would best meet their needs and interests.</li>
  <li>Design a user centered process to enable a seamless end to end experience for an individual in identifying, acquiring/accessing and using appropriate solutions to address their social isolation. This would include making informed decisions on options, enrolling into selected programs, acquiring technology, and securing training necessary to use selected solutions. The Social Engagement Clearinghouse will be interoperable, enable real-time indicators on program, technology and service availability, and enable assessment and screening information to be pushed by the consumer to their provider(s) of choice or whoever is supporting their care needs.</li>
  <li>Propose a mechanism to include and update user reviews and other information about usability, quality, accessibility and availability of social engagement programming and technology tools that informs individual decisions about which products to select.</li>
  <li>Pilot the use of the assessment and clearinghouse in a variety of settings including Aging and Disability Resource Centers.</li>
  <li>The user interface of prototypes should be designed with a feedback loop to continue to assess quality and accessibility of experience during the pilot.</li>
  <li>Evaluation of the pilot should also include the performance of the matching algorithms, the ability of the individual to enroll in selected social engagement programs and acquire the selected technology, and the impact the selected social engagement programs and technology tools have had on increasing the individual‚Äôs level of social engagement (i.e. reducing social isolation).</li>
</ul>

<p>Critical partners for designing solutions to this challenge should include a team of key stakeholders with relevant technical expertise as well as knowledge in technologies and programs that address social isolation. Preference will be given to teams that coordinate with or are informed by a state <a href="https://nwd.acl.gov/vdc.html">ADRC/No Wrong Door (NWD) System</a>. Since 2003, states and community-based organizations (CBOs) have invested in state NWDs to streamline access to long term services and supports for older adults, individuals with disabilities, and their caregivers. State NWD systems include a community-based approach to person-centered planning and assessment, information and referral to state and community resources, and a governance structure that ensures these functions are available across the state.</p>

<p>The challenge will compete in two phases with cash prizes awarded in each phase. The total prize award available is $750,000.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> The plan and design a Social Engagement Clearinghouse Interactive Prototype phase invites all eligible entities to submit a concept white paper outlining their technology, the potential impact for older adults, people with disabilities, racial and minority populations and Veterans that may be socially isolated, the innovative idea / concept behind how their platform could work and leverage existing efforts, and how this is informed by user needs they have identified. Each concept, wireframe, and prototype will be reviewed by a panel of judges with knowledge and expertise in technology, user design and experience. Only the first three pages (inclusive of any visual representations or graphics) of the concept description document will be reviewed along with the interactive prototype submission and its one page description, and the proposed plan to pilot the prototype in Phase 2. During the Phase I review process, the concept paper, interactive prototype and the proposed plan to pilot the prototype in Phase 2 will be redacted for both applicant and any specific organizational partner names referenced (versus broader categories of organizational partners) and reviewed by Federal evaluators screened to avoid conflicts of interest. Judges will review all submissions for Phase 1. A subset of the highest scoring submissions will be asked to be available September 15 through September 22, 2020 to participate in a 45 minute session to present and demo their Social Engagement Clearinghouse Interactive Prototype to the judges. ACL will provide additional criteria throughout the various phases to further define requirement expectations.</p>

<p>A panel of judges will review and score submissions between September 8, 2020 through September 29, 2020. Finalists to move to Phase 2 will be notified by September 30, 2020.</p>
