I"\<p>This is the second of three challenges the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is sponsoring. It is focused on the use of biotechnology to improve the performance of aerospace fuels. Participants will submit white papers on viability of the approach to bio-synthesize two molecules A and B needed for aerospace thermosets. In Phase Two, submitted white papers will be down-selected from the viable entrees.</p>

<p>The potential awardees will be given two weeks to enter into a subsequent agreement with a company that can scale up their production concept and demonstrate the capability to manufacture testable amounts with
a U.S. company (if they cannot manufacture themselves). Semi-finalist teams will be given a one-hour time slot to pitch their concept and scale up strategy, with their manufacturing partner (if needed), to the evaluation team.</p>
