I"æ3<p><em><strong>Competition Details:</strong></em><br />    <strong>1) Subject of Competition:</strong> The SBA is seeking a new design to be used as the official logo of the SBIR/STTR Programs and the recently redesigned website <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/"><em>https://www.sbir.gov/</em></a>. The SBIR/STTR Programs are extremely competitive and encourage small businesses to engage in federally funded research and development (R&amp;D) through eleven Federal agencies with R&amp;D needs. SBIR/STTR awards enable small businesses to explore their technological potential, stimulate innovation to meet federal R&amp;D needs, and potentially profit from private-sector commercialization of developed technologies. Since inception in 1982, 150,000 awards totaling $40 billion have been awarded to the small firms that participate. The programs touch, catalyze and seed the creation of STEM driven innovations in industries critical to the nation‚Äôs long term competitiveness and growth - from nanotech to robotics to mobile communications to genetic therapies to clean energy to advanced weapons to space exploration. Many of today‚Äôs technology giants ‚Äì or their underlying technological components ‚Äì received seed funding through SBIR or STTR awards via the eleven participating Federal agencies; the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Home Land Security and Transportation. (Visit the <em>sbir.gov</em> website at <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/"><em>https://www.sbir.gov/</em></a> for more information.)
