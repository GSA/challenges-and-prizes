I"“<p>Registration Process for Participants</p>

<p>To register for this Challenge, Challenge participants may access the registration on the Challenge website (<a href="https://www.synapse.org/upforachallenge">https://www.synapse.org/upforachallenge</a>).¬† Access to this website may also be found by searching the <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">www.challenge.gov</a> site for ‚ÄúUp For A Challenge.‚Äù¬† Individuals may participate in the Challenge as individuals or as Teams.¬† Details about participating as a Team are provided below:</p>
<ol>
	<li>After registration, you may participate alone or on a Team with other Challenge participants. To work on a Team, you may either create a new Team or join a pre-existing Team.</li>
	<li>There is no maximum Team size.</li>
	<li>All Teams must designate a Team Captain. Each individual member of a Team must be a registered participant in the Challenge.</li>
	<li>Individuals may participate on multiple Teams, and Challenge Teams may merge (requiring mutual agreement of Team Captains). Individuals are allowed to leave a Team to work alone or join another Team.</li>
</ol>
<p>Data Access Process

Once registered for the Challenge, participants must apply for controlled access to the designated Challenge genetic datasets following instructions on the Challenge website.¬† Challenge participants may use any of these dbGaP datasets or any other datasets available to anyone (either publically available or available through controlled access) such as data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (<a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">http://cancergenome.nih.gov/</a>) or the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project (<a href="http://www.genome.gov/encode/">http://www.genome.gov/encode/</a>).

Data will be requested through database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) application process.¬† Details regarding the process for requesting data are provided on the Challenge website (<a href="https://www.synapse.org/upforachallenge">https://www.synapse.org/upforachallenge</a>).¬† Data Access Requests will be reviewed by the appropriate NIH Data Access Committees (DAC) to ensure that the proposed project is consistent with any Data Use Limitations for the requested dataset(s).</p>
<p>¬† &lt;p&gt;NOTE: that any scientific collaborators, including contractors, who are not at the same institution as the PI must submit their own DAR. Data cannot be shared with collaborators from other institutions until they have submitted an application (and explicitly named this collaborators) to use the dataset(s) from their institution(s) and have received approval. If Approved Users are provided access to NIH genomic datasets for inter-institutional collaborative research described in the research use statement of the DAR, and all members of the collaboration are also Approved Users through their home institution(s), data obtained through this DAR may be securely transmitted within the collaborative group.</p>

<p>Challenge participants who obtain data from dbGaP should note that they are agreeing to the NIH Genomic Data User Code of Conduct (<a href="http://gds.nih.gov/pdf/Genomic_Data_User_Code_of_Conduct.pdf">http://gds.nih.gov/pdf/Genomic_Data_User_Code_of_Conduct.pdf</a>) and they are agreeing to the terms of specific Data Use Certificates for each individual dataset requested (The model Data Use Certificate can be found here ‚Äì <a href="http://gds.nih.gov/pdf/Model_DUC.pdf">http://gds.nih.gov/pdf/Model_DUC.pdf</a>).¬† Note that individual datasets may have additional limitations in regards to use of the data.¬† As the GWAS datasets obtained from dbGaP are considered controlled access data, individuals approved to use these data must abide by dbGaP security best practices in regards to the data (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/pdf/dbgap_2b_security_procedures.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/pdf/dbgap_2b_security_procedures.pdf</a>).&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>If submitting a request to dbGaP for use of data for the Challenge, participants should be aware that the data requested should be used solely for the research purpose described in the Data Access Request, i.e. solely for the Challenge. New uses of these data outside this Challenge will require submission of a new Data Access Request.

Challenge Entries

As used in this notice, ‚ÄúEntry‚Äù is the information submitted in the manner and format specified on the Up For A Challenge (U4C) website (<a href="https://www.synapse.org/upforachallenge">https://www.synapse.org/upforachallenge</a>). All Entries must be received by the applicable deadline. Entries submitted after a posted Challenge deadline will not be considered.

Entries may be submitted on behalf of a Team by any of its participants.¬† It is up to each Team to organize its Entry(ies) and to follow the Challenge submission requirements. On submission of an Entry, Challenge participants must include the Team name under which they are submitting.

All final Entries must be submitted through the Challenge website on Synapse, following website instructions and should provide necessary and sufficient detail and annotation for reproduction of the submitted results.</p>
<p>¬† Information accompanying each Entry should include:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Title of project</li>
	<li>Name of Team</li>
	<li>Names and field of expertise of Team members</li>
	<li>List of new pair-wise collaborations on Team (defined as individuals not having published together in the past 5 years)</li>
	<li>Information about how Team learned about the Challenge</li>
	<li>Identification of datasets used (1 page)</li>
	<li>A description of methods used to generate the findings (4 pages maximum)</li>
	<li>Narrative which addresses the evaluation criteria (identification of novel findings, replication of findings, innovation of approach, evidence of novel biological hypothesis(es), and collaboration) (6 pages maximum)</li>
	<li>The corresponding source code so that the Challenge organizers can re-run and manually review and verify that the code affiliated with the top scoring Entries yield the submitted results. Warranties</li>
	<li>By submitting an Entry to the Challenge, Challenge participants represent and warrant that all information provided in their Entries and as a result of the Challenge registration process is true and complete, that Challenge participants have the right and authority to submit such Entry on their own behalf or on behalf of the persons and entities specified within the Entry, and that the Entry:</li>
	<li>Only complete Entries, which follow application instructions, will be reviewed and eligible to win. Top performing Entries will be reviewed thoroughly.
