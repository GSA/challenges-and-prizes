<p>  The submission deadline for this competition has been EXTENDED to July 15, 2016. Winners will be announced by September 17, 2016. Finalists will be invited to Chicago to attend <a href="http://www.imts.com/" target="_blank">IMTS-The International Manufacturing Technology Show</a>, one of the largest manufacturing trade shows in the world, taking place September 12-17, 2016</p>
<p>Attention all college and university students! We are standing at the intersection of big data and industrial manufacturing, and we needÂ <em>you</em>Â to help us maximize connected technologies to revolutionize the manufacturing industry. Although the Industrial Internet of Things has been around for some time now,Â right now there isÂ a new wave of innovation in how these industrial machines communicate. Every piece on the factory floorÂ isÂ a potential source of valuable data that could be used to improve the entire manufacturing industry, from the products themselves toÂ how work gets done.</p>
<p>So weâ€™re asking you to develop super innovative and advanced manufacturing intelligence application solutions, which are both innovative and deployable, using data acquired through the MTConnect standard.Â MTConnect is an open, XML- and HTTP-based communications standard that acts as the enabler for the Internet of Things for manufacturing by fostering improved connectivity and interoperability between manufacturing equipment and devices.Â Within the challenge itself,Â there are two separateÂ competitions, and you can choose to participate in one or both.</p>
<p>#1â€”Â Idea Creation: Read more about the Ideation ChallengeÂ <u><a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/mtconnectstudentideas/" target="_blank">here</a></u>.</p>
<p> #2â€”Â Applications: Using either an independent idea/solution, or your solution from the Ideation Challenge (should you chose to complete both challenges),Â you must create an innovative and effective application of your solution. Your submission must include a written summary of the application, a video of the application in action, and a thumbnail image.</p>
