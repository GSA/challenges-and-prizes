I"˜<p>As NASA works to extend human exploration of the solar system, a sustained presence on the Moon will be critical for developing and testing the technologies and systems needed for future missions to Mars and beyond.</p>

<p>In situ resource utilization (ISRU)â€”the development of lunar materials for life support, fuel, energy, manufacturing, and constructionâ€”is necessary to limit the delivery of supplies from Earth.</p>

<p>One of the most important of these resources is water. Water supports all life on Earth, and will be critical to supporting human exploration beyond Earth. On the Moon, water is trapped in icy regolith at the lunar poles, including inside permanently shadowed regions (PSRs).</p>

<p>Phase 1 of the Break the Ice Lunar Challenge is focused on incentivizing new ideas and approaches to a system architecture for excavation and movement of icy regolith and water on the lunar surface.</p>
