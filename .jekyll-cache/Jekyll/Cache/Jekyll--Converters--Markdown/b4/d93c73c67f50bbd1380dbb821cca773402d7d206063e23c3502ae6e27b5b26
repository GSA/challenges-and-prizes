I"Ω<p><em>Challenge is closed. See press release below about the¬†winner and how the¬†code was used.¬†</em>    <a href="https://www.nga.mil/MediaRoom/News/Pages/First-Challenge-gov-winner-announced.aspx">NGA press release August 17, 2016</a>    NGA is looking for an easy-to-use time slider or another simple mechanism to track a living story as edits change the story.¬† Most version control comparison systems are based on radio button and point selection.¬† We‚Äôd like to turn this behind-the-scenes function into a friendly front-page dynamic solution. Basically, we would like to see what you come up with for a dynamic, fast, and aesthetic way to easily track versioned changes within our existing construct for the ‚Äúliving document,‚Äù in this case, a Wordpress post.    The Wordpress theme below was an attempt to move the version control behind the scenes to a vertical time slider. Red and green color codes show additions and deletions by bouncing around the page attempting to show where the content was added or modified.    The problem is page edits not currently within the browser active view cause vertical scrolls too quick for visual digestion.¬† How can we improve this?¬† The color codes highlighting additions and deletions move too fast. How can we slow this down? ¬†Or do you have another original idea to solve this?

The edits will be coming in frequently, so the time slider will have to update in real time.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;A friendly front-page solution that does not interfere with page loading or scrolling. This solution could be static, a panel which hides/fades, or something else altogether.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The solution should only appear in the browsers‚Äô active view.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Transition effects from one time period to another should happen very smoothly.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Source code must be simple enough to understand and extend, yet robust enough to function as intended.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  <em>Audience</em>: Your submission should be developed for end-users or readers who would like to easily view versioned changes within our existing construct for the ‚Äúliving document.‚Äù The primary audience is NOT the developer but the general reader.    <em>Platforms</em>: Your submission must be a custom theme or plugin that functions without errors on WordPress, and seamlessly work on any type browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
