I"4<p>Submit your design ideas for energy efficient buildings technologies to Oak Ridge Laboratoryâ€™s crowdsourcing community. The best technical ideas will get recognized at ORNL Industry Day, in presentations and possibly with 3-D printed prototype of the design. By combining the ORNL crowdsourcing community with the state-of-the-art capabilities at ORNL, innovators can rapidly collaborate with ORNL and other industry partners to develop the next big thing for the buildings market, allowing residential and commercial buildings customers to save money and energy.    New submissions and voting by online community members will run through the end of May. Ideas could be submitted within one of the three campaigns: Equipment &amp; Appliances, Sensors &amp; Controls, and Envelope Technologies. The five ideas with the highest votes per campaign will then be reviewed by a team of independent judges including ORNL building experts and industry partners. Judges will evaluate the technical feasibility of the top ideas. The judges will identify the best one idea per campaign that are technically feasible and with the greatest potential energy savings by the end of June. Design idea drawings or other supplemental materials may be requested, and prompt response is required to ensure timeliness of prototype 3-D printing.</p>
