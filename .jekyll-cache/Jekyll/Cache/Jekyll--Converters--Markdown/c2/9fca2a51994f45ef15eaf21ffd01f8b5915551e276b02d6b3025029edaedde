<p><strong>Description:</strong> The plan and design a Social Engagement Clearinghouse Interactive Prototype phase invites all eligible entities to submit a concept white paper outlining their technology, the potential impact for older adults, people with disabilities, racial and minority populations and Veterans that may be socially isolated, the innovative idea / concept behind how their platform could work and leverage existing efforts, and how this is informed by user needs they have identified. Each concept, wireframe, and prototype will be reviewed by a panel of judges with knowledge and expertise in technology, user design and experience. Only the first three pages (inclusive of any visual representations or graphics) of the concept description document will be reviewed along with the interactive prototype submission and its one page description, and the proposed plan to pilot the prototype in Phase 2. During the Phase I review process, the concept paper, interactive prototype and the proposed plan to pilot the prototype in Phase 2 will be redacted for both applicant and any specific organizational partner names referenced (versus broader categories of organizational partners) and reviewed by Federal evaluators screened to avoid conflicts of interest. Judges will review all submissions for Phase 1. A subset of the highest scoring submissions will be asked to be available September 15 through September 22, 2020 to participate in a 45 minute session to present and demo their Social Engagement Clearinghouse Interactive Prototype to the judges. ACL will provide additional criteria throughout the various phases to further define requirement expectations.</p>

<p>A panel of judges will review and score submissions between September 8, 2020 through September 29, 2020.  Finalists to move to Phase 2 will be notified by September 30, 2020.</p>
