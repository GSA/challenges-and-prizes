I"D<h4>Around the world, tens of millions of people are estimated to be in modern slavery, generating global profits estimated at $150 billion a year. The ILO estimates that 14.2 million people are victims of forced labor in private economic activities.</h4>
<p>We believe that forced labor has no place in the goods and services that make up today’s global economy and that we need new ideas, tools, and efforts to address this problem. From connecting with workers to identifying where forced labor is occurring, technology-informed approaches and tools will have a critical role to play. We encourage individuals, organizations, and teams to submit their ideas for using technology to address any aspect of forced labor in global supply chains. We look forward to supporting the best and most innovative ideas to become reality.</p>
