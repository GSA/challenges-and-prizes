I"ò<p><em>Note: This Competition is open only to the <strong>local governments of United States cities</strong> (referred to as municipalities and townships by the U.S. Census Bureau) or <strong>American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian communities, or their constituent agencies and subdivisions</strong>. See more details regarding eligibility rules for participating in the competition under ‚ÄúRules.‚Äù</em>    The SBA is seeking to support entrepreneurs who are navigating the requirements to start a business.¬† Currently many of these requirements are in multiple locations and a streamlined approach could help entrepreneurs startup more easily. The Startup in a Day Competition ‚Äì Dream Big Model is designed to spur the development, implementation, and improvement of online tools that will let entrepreneurs learn about the business startup process in their area, including how to register and apply for all required local licenses and permits, in one day or less. This announcement, the Startup in a Day Competition ‚Äì Dream Big Model, is specific for cities and Native American Communities that will develop an open source solution that may be freely adopted by localities across the United States. An ‚Äúopen source‚Äù solution is software that can be freely used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone<a href="https://www.challenge.gov/create-new-challenge/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> and complies with generally accepted criteria for distribution outlined by the Open Source Initiative (for this criteria, see http://opensource.org/docs/osd#fields-of-endeavor).    In order to maximize the success of this competition, SBA will work with the National League of Cities (NLC), an advocacy organization representing thousands of municipalities, to establish a formal mechanism by which all Startup in a Day competition winners will be able to collaborate and share best practices.    In conjunction with the Startup in a Day Competition, President Barack Obama is asking cities and Native American Communities across America to take a pledge to support entrepreneurs in their area by making it easier to start a business (for the text of this pledge, see sba.gov/startup). While it is not required to enter this Competition, all cities and Native American Communities are encouraged to take the pledge. As an additional encouragement, entries submitted by cities and Native American Communities that do take the pledge will receive five (5) bonus points during the evaluation process, as stipulated in Item 3: Part V below. Furthermore, all Startup in a Day Competition ‚Äì Dream Big Model winners will be required to take the pledge prior to receiving their prizes.    <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/create-new-challenge/#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Open Source Initiative, Welcome to The Open Source Initiative, Palo Alto, CA: Open Source Initiative.
