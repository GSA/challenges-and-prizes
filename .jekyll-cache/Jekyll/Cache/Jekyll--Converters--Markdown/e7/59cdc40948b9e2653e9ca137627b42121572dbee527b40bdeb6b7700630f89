<p>The current chemical biological suit’s burden, weight, and bulkiness restrict the warfighter’s agility, range of motion, and maneuverability necessary to conduct their duties. It also adds additional heat stress during physically active tasks. The suit materials and its various parts are disjointed and do not seamlessly integrate. This inhibits the ability of the warfighter to be skillfully tactile and dexterous during a mission. Altogether, these challenges may increase the physical and cognitive fatigue in an already challenging environment.    We are seeking innovative ideas for solutions that will increase warfighter mobility, dexterity and tactility, allowing the warfighter to complete all relevant tasks (including running, climbing, etc.) in a fast and comfortable manner, without cognitive/physiological fatigue associated with the ensemble.    We are also seeking ideas for heat management that reduce heat burden and actively cool the warfighter as various physical tasks are conducted. Finally, we welcome ideas that improve the seamless integration between suit components, such as mask-helmet or glove-boot interface. Ultimately, the solution must aid in protecting the warfighter against chemical and biological warfare agents and radiological particles. The goal is to relieve any burdens and hazards to the warfighter and improve operational capabilities in combating chemical and biological wartime threats.    The challenge consists of a 10-week idea submission period followed by a two-week blitz round for rapid refinement. Participants will compete for prizes within a $250,000 prize pot. The following prizes will be awarded:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Up to five small prize contest winners of up to $5,000 each<em>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Up to three runners-up winning up to $25,000 each</em>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Up to three finalists winning $50,000-$150,000*&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;For finalists who opt-in and meet further acceptability criteria:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Cooperative Research &amp; Development Agreement (CRADA) assessment and/or third party testing. Important Note: Solutions may be selected to test on a case-by-case basis given the feasibility to test the solution. The government reserves the right to not release the test data for any reason, including the data’s security classification. Data may not be made available to participants based on data security classification.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  *The Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) for Chemical and Biological Defense reserves the right to allocate fund amounts based on submission score.</p>
