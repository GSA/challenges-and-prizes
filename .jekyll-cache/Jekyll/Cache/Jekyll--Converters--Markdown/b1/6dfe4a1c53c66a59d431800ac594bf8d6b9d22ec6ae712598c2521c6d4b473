<p><strong>9.7 Mediation:</strong>
These Participation Terms and Conditions and our relationship with You will be governed exclusively by laws in force in Washington, D.C., USA. Any litigation arising out of or relating to the Artisanal Mining Grand Challenge: the Amazon must be filed and pursued exclusively in the Courts of Washington, District of Columbia (D.C.), USA and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts. If either Party resorts to legal action relating to the participation, the prevailing party will be entitled to an award of all its costs and reasonable attorneys‚Äô fees. Prior to filing any litigation claim, Parties both agree to seek mediation with a third party, not directly associated with the claim and selected by mutual agreement from the standing members of the review committee of the Challenge, in an effort to resolve any dispute.</p>

<p>The Parties shall cooperate with one another in selecting a mediator and in scheduling the mediation proceedings. Each Party shall designate at least one (1) person with full settlement authority to attend an in-person mediation in Washington, District of Columbia, USA. The mediation must take place within thirty (30) days of a Party‚Äôs written request to engage in mediation, unless agreed otherwise in writing by the Parties.</p>

Failure to file the demand to arbitrate with JAMS within such 180-day period shall mean that any right to arbitrate or litigate in any manner such Dispute shall be forever forfeited and waived.</p>

<p><strong>9.8.1 Mandatory and Binding Arbitration</strong> ‚Äì The arbitration and the Parties‚Äô agreement therefore will be deemed to be self-executing, and if either Party fails to appear at any properly-noticed arbitration proceeding, an award may be entered against such Party despite said failure to appear and the matter will be dismissed with prejudice. Failure by either Party to pay the fees (or provide a required deposit) of the arbitrators and/or the arbitration administrator in accordance with the rules and policies of the applicable arbitration administrator will result in a forfeiture by the non-paying Party of the right to prosecute or defend the claim which is the subject of the arbitration, but will not otherwise serve to abate, stay, or suspend the arbitration proceedings. The Parties will share equally the arbitrators‚Äô fees and expenses, administrative expenses, or other costs incurred in the arbitration; provided, however, that each party shall bear its own attorneys‚Äô and experts‚Äô fees and its own costs incurred in connection with any Dispute hereunder including the arbitration of any Dispute. Further, each Party shall compensate and pay all expenses for its employees and, with respect to Team, all other Team Members for their participation in the arbitration.</p>

<p><strong>9.8.2 Scope of Arbitrators‚Äô Authority</strong> ‚Äì The arbitrators will have no power or authority to grant attorneys‚Äô fees, punitive or exemplary damages as part of their award. In no event may the provisions of this Agreement, or any ancillary agreement executed in connection with this Agreement, including, without limitation, amendments to this Agreement, be waived, modified, changed, or otherwise equitably excused by the arbitrators at any arbitration hearing. The Parties do not grant the arbitrators the powers of an amiable compositeur and the arbitrators do not have the power to decide ex aequo et bono. The arbitrators will apply Washington DC substantive Law to the proceeding. The arbitrators will not have the power to commit errors of Law or legal reasoning, and the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error. Any arbitration will be conducted in English in Washington D.C., USA.</p>

<p><strong>9.8.3 Jurisdiction for Entering Arbitration Awards</strong> ‚Äì The award of the arbitrators will be the exclusive remedy between the Parties regarding any claims, causes of action, counterclaims, issues, or accountings presented or pleaded to the arbitrators. Any petition, motion, or request to vacate the award shall be filed exclusively in the Superior Court of the District of the Columbia, and the Parties expressly consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the District of Columbia.</p>

<p><strong>9.8.4 Stage 1 Arbitration</strong> ‚Äì The first stage of arbitration shall be conducted before JAMS in Washington DC, in accordance with the JAMS Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures by three (3) arbitrators appointed as follows: each Party shall select an arbitrator, and such arbitrators shall select a third; provided, however, that in all events at least two (2) out of the three (3) arbitrators must be active members of the bar of a U.S. State and that each arbitrator must be fluent in English. The matters to be considered and determined by the arbitrators in Stage 1 Arbitration shall include and be limited to the following:</p>

<p>(i) First, the arbitrators shall determine whether or not the Party that served the Notice of Dispute strictly complied with the requirements set forth in Section 9.6 above. If the arbitrators determine that the Party that served the Notice of Dispute failed to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 9.6 above, then the arbitrators shall issue an award dismissing the Dispute with prejudice and ruling that the Party that served the Notice of Dispute shall take nothing thereunder.</p>

<p>(ii) Next, if (a) the arbitrators determine that the Party that served the Notice of Dispute did strictly comply with the requirements of Section 9.6 above, and (b) either Party asserts that the Limitation of Liability provisions set forth in Section 8.5 above are unenforceable in whole or in part, then the arbitrators shall next determine whether or not the Dispute is subject to the Limitation of Liability provisions set forth in Section 8.5 above and issue a ruling of their findings. For purposes of this determination, the Parties agree and represent that the Limitation of Liability Clauses are not contrary to public policy.</p>

<p>(iii) Each Party‚Äôs representation in this paragraph is a material inducement for the other party to enter into this agreement. If neither party asserts that the limitation of liability provisions set forth in Section 8.5 above are unenforceable in whole or in part, then the arbitrators shall issue a ruling that such provisions are fully enforceable with respect to the dispute.</p>

<p>(iv) All awards, decisions and rulings made with regard to the items specified above by the arbitrators in Stage 1 Arbitration shall be binding upon both Parties and upon the arbitrators in 9.8.4 Stage 2 Arbitration (if applicable). However, except as required to establish the decisions and rulings of the arbitrators, the records of the proceedings in Stage 1 Arbitration shall not be admissible as evidence in Stage 2 Arbitration proceedings.</p>

<p><strong>9.8.5 Ninety (90)-Day Cooling Off Period</strong> ‚Äì If the arbitrators have not dismissed the Dispute with prejudice when they issue their final rulings pursuant to Section 9.8.4 (i) above, then the Parties shall wait for a period of ninety (90) calendar days before proceeding with Stage 2 Arbitration, during which ninety (90)-day period, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve the Dispute. This period may be extended by mutual agreement of the Parties.</p>

<p><strong>9.8.6 Stage 2 Arbitration</strong> ‚Äì If necessary, the second stage of arbitration shall be conducted before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Washington DC, in accordance with the then-prevailing Rules of Arbitration of the ICC by three (3) arbitrators appointed as follows: each Party shall select an arbitrator, and such arbitrators shall select a third; provided, however, that in all events at least two (2) out of the three (3) arbitrators must be active members of the bar of a U.S. State and that each arbitrator must be fluent in English. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the arbitrators used in Stage 1 Arbitration may be selected in Stage 2 Arbitration.</p>

<p><strong>9.9  Attorney‚Äôs Fees:</strong>
Unless otherwise expressly set forth herein, the Parties shall bear their own attorney‚Äôs fees, costs, and expenses in connection with the matters set forth in the Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>10. Confidentiality</strong></p>

<p>10.1 ‚ÄúConfidential Information‚Äù Defined: Pursuant to this Agreement, each Party may provide the other, or its affiliates, certain information or material that is confidential to the disclosing Party. Such information or materials shall be marked as ‚ÄúConfidential‚Äù by the disclosing Party prior to disclosure.</p>

<p>10.2 Exclusions from ‚ÄúConfidential Information‚Äù: Information or material will not be considered as confidential hereunder if it: (i) is public knowledge as of the Effective Date or subsequently becomes such through no breach of this Agreement; (ii) is rightfully in the receiving Party‚Äôs possession prior to the disclosing Party‚Äôs disclosure, as shown by written records; (iii) is rightfully disclosed to the receiving Party by a third party without restriction on its disclosure; (iv) is independently developed by or for the receiving Party without reliance upon Confidential Information received from the disclosing Party; and/or (v) is required to be disclosed by law.</p>

<p>10.3 Obligation of Confidentiality: Each Party will: (i) hold the other Party‚Äôs Confidential Information in confidence (using at least the same measures as it does to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature) and not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party except to the extent permitted by the terms of this Agreement; and (ii) not remove or permit to be removed from any item any proprietary, confidential, or copyright notices, markings, or legends placed thereon by either Party. This obligation will continue in effect for five (5) years after expiration or termination of the Agreement.</p>

<p>10.4 Applicant‚Äôs Entry and Submissions: Conservation X Labs acknowledges that information relating to technical aspects of any Entry developed by an Applicant and submitted to CXL‚Äôs platform or the Judging Panel as required by this Agreement, will be deemed Confidential Information of the Applicant, regardless of whether or not it is marked as such.</p>

<p>10.5 Injunctive Relief: Each Party acknowledges that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Section 11 above (Confidentiality), and such breach would result in irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, each Party, in addition to any other remedies that it may have, will be entitled, without the requirement of proving actual damages or posting a bond or other security (to the extent permitted under Law), to obtain equitable relief, including without limitation injunctive relief and specific performance in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p>10.6 Remedies: The remedies stated in Section 11.5 above are non-exclusive and the exercise of any right a Party may have will not preclude the exercise of any other right under this Agreement, at law, or in equity.</p>

<p><strong>11. Media Rights Agreement</strong></p>

<p><strong>11.1   Unlimited License</strong></p>

<p>CXL intends to capture audio, video, digital, and photographic material related to the Challenge (‚ÄúCXL Media‚Äù). CXL shall retain (on behalf of itself, its Coalition, and Funders) the right to use Applicant‚Äôs name, likeness, image, and biographical information in any and all media for any purpose, including, without limitation, advertising and promotional purposes relating to the Competition and (b) releases CXL, its contractors, its coalition partners, and its Funders, as well as the directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, licensors, and suppliers of each, from any liability with respect thereto.</p>

<p><strong>11.2  Right of Access</strong></p>

<p>The Applicant shall give Conservation X Labs preferential (above Applicant media partners and other media organizations) access to any and all Applicant facilities or events for the purposes of the capture of CXL Media for later usage; these requests shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed. Applicant shall use best efforts to provide similar access to facilities of Applicant contractors, Funders, or partners for the purposes of capture of CXL Media. If such access is not possible, such as for reasons of confidentiality or health and safety, Applicant shall provide a CXL with a written communication describing with particularity the reasons that such access is not possible. CXL shall consider such communication in good faith and will then determine whether or not (in its sole discretion) to waive this requirement with respect to the particular facility or event. The parties acknowledge and agree that Applicant‚Äôs agreement to provide such preferential access constitutes material consideration under this Agreement and CXL‚Äôs ability to capture and use CXL Media in communications to the general public is a primary purpose for which the Challenge is conducted. Accordingly, submission of bad faith requests or other abuse of this provision may, in the sole discretion of CXL, result in Applicant‚Äôs disqualification or other adverse consequences to Applicant.  Applicant agrees to execute all papers and to perform any acts as CXL may deem necessary to secure for CXL or its designee the rights herein assigned or granted, including, without limitation, any third-party consents that may be necessary to capture and use CXL Media. Further, Applicant irrevocably appoints CXL as Applicant‚Äôs attorney-in-fact to do all of the foregoing, such appointment being coupled with an interest.</p>

<p><strong>11.2. No Limitation on License</strong></p>

<p>CXL shall have the right to use, copy, sublicense, modify, transmit, display, distribute, perform, make, sell, assign, license, transfer, import, export, and otherwise dispose of or exploit CXL Media in any manner or medium whatsoever, existing now or in the future, including, without limitation, all motion picture rights of every kind, including, without limitation, theatrical and documentary motion picture rights, television motion picture rights, and home video rights, and all allied, subsidiary, and derivative rights, including, without limitation, sequel, prequel, and remake rights, novelization, comic book, comic strip, newspaper comics, ‚Äúmaking of‚Äù book, merchandising rights, commercial tie-ups, stage rights, radio rights, webcast rights, internet display rights, and promotional and advertising rights, including, without limitation, the right to broadcast over radio, television, the internet, and all other media, advertisements with respect to any production produced based on the Challenge or the story of the Challenge. The right to capture and use CXL Media shall include, without limitation, all rights and title in and to any and all audio, video, or photographic material created by, or on the behalf of, CXL or its agent, representatives and assignees. CXL shall not receive any pecuniary consideration in exchange for the license or distribution of CXL Media. Except as necessary for purposes of judging the Challenge, CXL will not require Applicant to disclose their Craft in dissembled form or permit access to discussions with respect to pending patent applications or other Confidential Information of Applicant. Nevertheless, Applicant bears ultimate responsibility for ensuring that its Confidential Information is not revealed during the recording of any CXL Media.</p>

<p><strong>11.3. Depiction of Intellectual Property</strong></p>

<p>If CXL desires to depict any Applicant Intellectual Property not covered by the grants of rights herein in its production of CXL Media or for advertising or promotional purposes, CXL shall submit a request to Applicant for permission to use such materials solely for such purposes of producing media content or educational materials related to the Challenge. Applicant agrees not to unreasonably withhold, condition, or delay approval for CXL to depict Applicant Intellectual Property for production of CXL Media or educational materials related to the Challenge, it being understood that such approval would be withheld reasonably if it were to unduly interfere with Applicant‚Äôs revenue generation, efforts to file patent applications, agreements with financiers or customers, or trade secrets. Furthermore, Applicant agrees not to unreasonably withhold permission for advertising or promotional use related to the Challenge. Applicant shall use best efforts to respond to such requests within ten (10) business days. If the content of any CXL Media is subject to 17 U.S.C. 106A or any similar laws, Applicant hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert all rights under such laws and irrevocably appoints CXL as its agent to assert on Applicant‚Äôs behalf, Applicant‚Äôs moral rights or any equivalent rights regarding the form or extent of any alteration to the CXL Media (including, without limitation, removal or destruction) or the making of any derivative works based on the CXL Media, including, without limitation, photographs, drawings or other visual reproductions of the work, in any medium, for CXL‚Äôs purposes.</p>

<p><strong>11.4. Prior Review of Applicant Media Partners</strong></p>

<p>CXL will use reasonable efforts to promote the Challenge. CXL also anticipates that Applicant may enter agreements with media partners that are interested in promoting Applicant‚Äôs participation in the Challenge (‚ÄúApplicant Media Partners‚Äù). Applicant shall provide notice to CXL no later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the execution of any agreement with an Applicant Media Partner, by submitting the following information to CXL: (i) name of Applicant Media Partner; (ii) a brief description of the media, marketing, or promotional rights granted to the Applicant Media Partner; and (iii) a written summary of the business points of any agreement with the Applicant Media Partner. CXL shall review such agreement terms within ten (10) business days. If such contracts or relationships involve any contractual or implicit commitment to exclusivity, then CXL may impose limitations on or reject the proposed Applicant Media Partner Agreement as CXL determines to be in the best interests of the Challenge. CXL may also reject the proposed Applicant Media Partner Agreement, if such agreement , in CXL‚Äôs sole opinion: (i) would cause Applicant to breach any term of this Agreement; (ii) would require unsuitable advertising including, but not limited to, any advertising that depicts, describes, implies, or promotes obscene or sexually explicit matters, libelous or illegal matters, violence, racial, sexual or other types of legally prohibited discrimination, a particular political view, or may infringe on or otherwise violate any rights of CXL or any third party; (iii) conflicts with the exclusivity of or jeopardizes any sponsorship associated with the Challenge; or (iv) undermines the Challenge, its underlying goals, or the mission of CXL. Team is encouraged to work with CXL well prior to finalizing any agreements with an Applicant Media Partner to streamline the approval process. If Applicant has signed agreements with Applicant Media Partners or other similar relationships prior to the execution of this Agreement, Applicant shall provide to CXL a detailed written summary of the business points of such agreements and shall amend or terminate such agreements upon request by CXL in accordance with this Exhibit.</p>
