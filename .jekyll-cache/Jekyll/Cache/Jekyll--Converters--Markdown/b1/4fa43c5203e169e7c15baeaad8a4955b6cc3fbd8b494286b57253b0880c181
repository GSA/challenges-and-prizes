I"·<p>NEI is seeking innovative solutions to achieve significant advances over currently available protocols to grow retina organoids. As solvers address the evaluation criteria outlined below, they should state how and why they expect their proposed new methods or changes/additions to existing methods will improve aspects of retina organoids. Solutions must outline ideas to produce 3-D retina organoids&nbsp;that:</p>
<ul> <li>Are generated from human cells (derived from iPSC, federally approved ESC, multipotent cells, or adult cells subjected to a combination of transdifferentiation/reprogramming&nbsp;methods);</li> <li>Are physiologically and morphologically relevant to normal or disease state;&nbsp;and</li> <li>Consist of the major retina cell types and represent their biological functions and&nbsp;interplay.</li> </ul>
<p>Solutions that propose to grow cells in 2-D culture using a tissue-on-a-chip system are not of interest for this Challenge. However, creative approaches that incorporate use of microfluidics or perfusion to enhance culture of 3-D organoids are&nbsp;encouraged.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Evaluation Criterion 1. Cell Type, Structure, Viability, and Function (Recommended weighting&nbsp;50%)</em></p>
<ul> <li>Cell Types:&nbsp; What aspects of protocol ensure that all five neuronal retina cell types (photoreceptors, bipolar cells, ganglion cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells) will be produced on included? Will other cell types be generated or included? If the method eliminates a cell type, justify why it is not included (i.e. the disease being modelled lacks the specific cell&nbsp;type).</li> <li>Structure:&nbsp; What approach (e.g., self-organization or bioengineering with scaffolds, bioprinting, and/or a microfluidic apparatus) is proposed to achieve 3-D assembly? What aspects of the protocol ensure that 3-D organoids will be properly oriented and have layers recapitulating a laminated&nbsp;retina?</li> <li>Viability:&nbsp; Does the protocol incorporate new procedural steps or technologies that aim to increase duration of viability as compared to current&nbsp;protocols?</li> <li>Functional characterization of cell types:&nbsp; Does the solution incorporate novel steps or technologies that may enable all cell types to remain functional through the latest viable time&nbsp;point?&nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p><em>Evaluation Criterion 2. Robustness and Reproducibility (Recommended weighting&nbsp;25%)</em></p>
<ul> <li>Is the protocol sufficiently clear and detailed to facilitate inter/intra-laboratory utility and reproducibility? What other resources will be developed to facilitate&nbsp;transferability?&nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p><em>Evaluation Criterion 3. Scientific applications and uses for models &nbsp;(Recommended weighting for each category:&nbsp;25%)</em></p>
<p><em>Biology/Disease&nbsp;Modeling</em></p>
<ul> <li>What aspects of the protocol are in place to improve faithful recapitulation of the biological&nbsp;complexity?</li> <li>How will this recapitulation be&nbsp;validated?</li> <li>How will viability be tested, and how is the disease state expected to affect&nbsp;viability?&nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p><em>High Content&nbsp;Screening</em></p>
<ul> <li>How will the proposed model&rsquo;s amenability to high content screening be enhanced? How will this be&nbsp;tested?</li> <li>How will the model&rsquo;s ability to recapitulate known retina toxicities be&nbsp;tested?</li> <li>What methods will be used to mass-produce the proposed&nbsp;model?</li> </ul>
