I"j<p>Our goals are to spur new, innovative thinking in radiation detection algorithms by engaging a broader community. For this competition, we have used radiation transport simulations to create thousands of data sets resembling typical radiological search data collected on urban streets in a mid-sized U.S. city. Each data set &ndash; called a run &ndash; simulates the detection events received by a standard thallium-doped sodium iodide detector driving along several city street blocks in a search vehicle. All of the runs contain data on radiation-detector interaction events from the natural background sources (roadway, sidewalks, and buildings), and some of the runs also contain data arising from non-natural extraneous radiation sources.&nbsp;Your task is to determine whether there&rsquo;s a source present on the street, and if so where and what kind it is.</p>
