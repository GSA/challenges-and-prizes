I"<p>Books are essential to early grade reading instruction. However, often times when books (both textbooks and supplemental reading materials) are ordered for low income countries, they do not end up in the hands of the students who need them. The first step in solving this problem is the ability to track books in transit and trace them to their destination. As such, <em>All Children Reading: A Grand Challenge for Development</em> has launched the Tracking and Tracing Books Prize Competition.  The competition seeks innovations to track books destined for early-grade classrooms and learning centers in low-income countries and allow stakeholders, ranging from parents to Ministries of Education and donor agencies, to quickly and easily access tracking information.</p>
