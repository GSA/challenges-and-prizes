I"™<p>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) helps power and secure Americaâ€™s future and ensure the countryâ€™s role as a leader in science and technology. In 2015, the Secretary of Energy authorized the formation of the Office of Technology Transitions (OTT) to be responsible for developing and overseeing delivery of DOEâ€™s strategic vision and goals for technology commercialization and engagement with the business and industrial sectors across the United States. OTTâ€™s mission is to expand the commercial impact and public benefit of DOEâ€™s research and development portfolio to advance the economic, energy, and national security interests of the Nation.Â </p>

<p>Energy startups and innovative technologies are critical to the growth of the energy economy in the United States and abroad. Startups drive technology development, business model innovation, and job creation. The private sector has had difficulty providing sufficient capital, business development services, and entrepreneurial training to early-stage, high-risk, longer-term, capital-intensive technologies, like those required for transforming the nationâ€™s energy systems.Â </p>

<p>Strong business incubation servicesâ€”including, but not limited to, mentoring, entrepreneurial training, access to testing and prototyping assistanceâ€”not only provide direct support for early-stage startups, but also have the potential to de-risk the startups for follow-on investors. Incubators have the potential to accelerate regional economic development, strengthen national innovation capacity, and expand domestic energy-related manufacturing. By providing due diligence, screening applicant companies, assisting with prototyping, connecting entrepreneurs with manufacturers, and advising startups to prudently use their capital on vital services, incubators play a critical role in supporting startups as they transition into the market.</p>

<p>The EPIC prize seeks to recognize the most novel, comprehensive, and impactful incubator plans that focus on developing strong innovation clusters, connections, and support for energy-related technology and entrepreneurial innovation. Prize competitors will develop a strategic plan to create or bolster innovation clusters through regional engagement, including engagement of other private actorsâ€”both for- and non-profitâ€”as well as state and local entities that can provide additional resources. 
The prize seeks to address a capital gap in supporting these critical organizations by providing funds to be applied where incubators need them most. Providing capital to enable creative, forward-thinking organizations is critical to allow organizations to think more expansively about the role of incubators in the broader regional and national innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem. Further, it is DOEâ€™s hope that this funding will enable winners of this prize to enhance their organizationâ€™s resilience and operational sustainability.</p>
