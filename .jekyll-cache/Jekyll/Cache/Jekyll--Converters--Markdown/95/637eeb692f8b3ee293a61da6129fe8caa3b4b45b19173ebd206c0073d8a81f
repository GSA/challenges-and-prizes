<div class="description">
                          <p>Competitors will be asked to produce an in-vitro vascularized tissue that is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&gt;</span> 1 centimeter in thickness in all dimensions at the launch of the trial and maintains <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&gt;</span>85% survival of the required parenchymal cells throughout a 30-day period. Tissues must provide adequate blood perfusion without uncontrolled leakage into the bulk tissue to maintain metabolic functionality similar to their in-vivo native cells. Histological measurement of the quality and amount of functional performance will be required to determine survival of parenchymal tissue. Teams must demonstrate 3 successful trials with at least a 75% trial success rate to win an award. In addition to the in-vitro trials, teams must also submit a Spaceflight Experiment Concept that details how they would further advance some aspect of their tissue vascularization research through a microgravity experiment that could be conducted in the U.S. National Laboratory (ISS-NL) onboard the International Space Station.</p>
