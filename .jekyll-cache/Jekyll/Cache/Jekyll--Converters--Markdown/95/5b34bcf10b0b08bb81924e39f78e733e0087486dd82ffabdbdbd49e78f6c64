<p>The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is seeking new methods for detecting soil particle movement:</p>
<ul> <li>Directly or indirectly&nbsp;in earthen structures and foundations</li> <li>Earlier than occurs by current visual inspection and instrumentation methods</li> </ul>
<p>There are 85,000 dams, nearly 100,000 miles of levees, and thousands of miles of water delivery canals across the U.S. &nbsp;Solving this problem could impact millions of people who receive water, power, and flood protection from this infrastructure. This is an Ideation Challenge with a guaranteed award for at least one submitted solution.</p>
