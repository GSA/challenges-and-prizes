I"õ<p>Do you have improvements or suggestions to make the Department of the Interiors (DOI) Agency Financial Report (AFR), which provides important financial and performance information, more beneficial? We hope that increasing our financial data with visualization tools like DOIs U.S. Heat Map (www.doi.gov/pfm/afr/2013/maps/index.cfm) will add value by promoting transparency, increasing financial accountability, and communicating information in a useful, relevant, and easily digestible manner.</p>
