I"X<p>DHS S&amp;T is calling upon innovators to design a better UI for digital wallets that store credentials. DHSâ€™s prize competition is for better Trusted UI for Digital Wallets with a total prize purse of $25,000. The winning designs will be easy-to-use, trustworthy and improve the overall user experience and management of digital wallet-based credentials.</p>

<p>Some DHS operations are using blockchain and distributed technologies to issue and verify credentials using open standards. These systems use credentials that may be issued by DHS and held in a digital wallet. DHS is looking for UI design that supports best practices for visual consistency, ensures security and privacy, is interoperable, and can be integrated with existing back-end processes. The user interface needs to instill confidence in the user of the digital wallet that their online interactions are secure and that the parties they are interacting with are legitimate. The goal of this Challenge is to foster better UIs for digital wallets to be used by DHS and anyone in the community.</p>

<p>This Challenge will compare UI designs.</p>
