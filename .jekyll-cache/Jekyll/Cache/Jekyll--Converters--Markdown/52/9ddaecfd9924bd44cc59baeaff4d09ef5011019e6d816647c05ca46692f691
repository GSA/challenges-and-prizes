<p>Submission Requirements   </p>
<p> <strong>The Challenge has three phases.</strong>  </p>
<p>  <em>Phase One â€“ Design </em>    The first stage of the prize competition aims to attract a large set of ideas and innovators. The target product of the first stage will be the conceptualization of the most promising innovations to help support parental and caregiver behavior change around the early language environment. The submissions should aim to demonstrate that the proposed intervention will be accessible across diverse backgrounds and easily implemented by users.    The Phase 1 Submission shall include:    A comprehensive description of the proposed intervention in 5 pages or less, including:  <ul>   <li>A one-paragraph executive summary that clearly states the question to be solved;</li>   <li>Background information linking the evidence to support the intervention;</li>   <li>A descriptive analysis of how the applicant arrived at their idea;</li>   <li>Descriptions of the methods and technologies involved in implementation of the intervention; and</li>   <li>An assessment describing the applicantâ€™s ability to execute the proposed solution in Phase 2 and 3.</li>  </ul> </p>
<p> <em>Phase Two â€“ Development and Small Scale Testing</em>    The winners of Phase One of the prize competition will then advance to a second stage focused on prototyping the intervention, and testing of the effectiveness of the intervention. Using support from the Phase One prize, intervention developers will test the efficacy of their models, to show that the proposed intervention demonstrates an impact on the outcomes of interest for children and families. The applicants should demonstrate both the evidence base for the intervention and its usability. Mentors will be made available to help solvers design appropriate testing methodologies and learn more about the evidence base.   </p>
<p> <em>Phase Three â€“ Scaling</em>    The final phase of the Word Gap Incentive Prize will involve testing the most promising models at greater scale through rollout at the program or community level. This will test the scalability of the device at low-cost, the feasibility of implementation, and the impact on the intended outcomes. Applicants will be assisted in matching their submission with a community or program.</p>
