I"ê'<p>Winner Update:    &lt;p&gt;The Challenge Managers, Traci Walker and Joanie Newhart, both of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), made the call to notify <strong>Team ICF International and ASI Government</strong> that their program design had been selected as the winner of the Digital Service Contracting Professional Training and Development Program challenge. This means they will have the opportunity to partner with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and the US Digital Service to pilot their training program with 30 Federal contracting professionals and help foster transformative change in the Federal Digital Service acquisition culture.    The winning program design comprises customized learning paths, self-directed learning, guided learning, and a live digital assignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the six month pilot, which kicks off on October 20, 2015, the challenge winner will work in close collaboration with OFPP and the U.S. Digital Service to test its concepts and produce the first cohort of certified digital service contracting experts. After successful completion of the pilot and incorporation of lessons learned, the final program design will be turned over to federal acquisition training institutions for implementation. This challenge is only the beginning of OMB‚Äôs efforts to develop digital service and IT expertise for contracting professionals, program managers, and other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Digital Service and Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), as part of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), give notice of the availability of the ‚ÄúDigital Service Contracting Professional Training and Development Program‚Äù prize competition and rules. Through a multi-phased challenge, participants are eligible for prize money up to $360,000.00 under this competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2014, the US Digital Service was launched to bring in the country‚Äôs brightest digital talent to transform how government works for American citizens and businesses by dramatically improving the way government builds and buys digital services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On December 4, 2014, Anne Rung, Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, issued a memorandum titled Transforming the Marketplace: Simplifying Federal Procurement to Improve Performance, Drive Innovation, and Increase Savings.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this memorandum, Administrator Rung lays out several initiatives for driving greater innovation and strengthening Federal acquisition practices, one of which is building digital information technology (IT) acquisition expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of this initiative, OFPP and the U.S. Digital Service are working together to focus on improving the process of IT acquisition, and specifically the acquisition of digital services. OFPP and the US Digital Service recognize the need for improving and simplifying the digital experiences that citizens and businesses have with the Government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strengthening digital services expertise in the Government is a key component of being able to reduce the risk of failed acquisitions and systems, and save taxpayer dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Digital Service Contracting Professional Training and Development Program prize competition seeks to spur innovation in the training and development of Federal Contracting Professionals who are fundamental to the success of digital service acquisitions. Through program concept white papers, up to three design presentations, and a pilot program, the effectiveness and feasibility of innovative training and development program approaches will be explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please send inquiries or questions to Challenge@omb.eop.gov or post to the discussion thread on challenge.gov    <strong>Objective:¬† </strong>The goal of this prize competition is to develop a Digital Service Contracting Professional Training and Development Program for the Federal Government, which will be used to add a digital service core-plus specialization for contracting professionals under the Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting (FAC-C) Program issued by OFPP<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a>.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final results of the challenge will be provided to Federal training institutions, such as the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) and Defense Acquisition University (DAU), for those institutions to implement and maintain the program. This program will be one of many initiatives to foster transformative change in the Federal Digital Service acquisition culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The optimal comprehensive training and development program, intended for Federal Contracting Professionals, specifically Contracting Officers and Contract Specialists, will enable them to understand and apply strategic thinking, industry best practices, market place conditions, and appropriate acquisition strategies to the procurement of digital supplies and services. An ideal training and development program will be no longer than 6 months in total, and may include strategies such as rotational assignments, mentoring, in-classroom training, and detail assignments woven into an innovative approach to accomplish the stated objectives. A definition of a successful digital service buyer, novel ideas, leading-edge approaches, and iterative methodologies are highly encouraged in response to this Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital services, as defined by OMB, refers to ‚Äúthe delivery of digital information (data or content) and transactional services (e.g., online forms, benefits applications) across a variety of platforms, devices, and delivery mechanisms (e.g., websites, mobile applications, and social media).‚Äù Digital services may be delivered to customers either internal or external to the Government, or both.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[ii]</a>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary outcomes of this Digital Service Contracting Professional Training and Development Program are that participating Federal contracting professionals:  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Become digital service procurement experts;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Are equipped with the knowledge necessary to be imbedded within agency Digital Service teams to serve as a business advisor to the team, its customers, and its stakeholders; and&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Have the knowledge to lead agency training, workshops, and consultations in order to expand digital service procurement expertise within their agency and the government.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Specifically, the program must teach Federal Contracting Professionals how to:    (1) Understand and procure digital services and supplies utilizing concepts such as those described in the Digital Services Playbook <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[iii]</a> and the TechFAR<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[iv]</a> (e.g, DevOps, UX, Design Services, Agile Software Development, Open Source, Cloud, Iaas, SaaS, and PaaS);    (2) Appropriately measure the success of these contracts based on industry standards;    (3) Accurately describe and define the value received; and    (4) Encourage the use of commercial practices and innovative approaches (e.g. modular contracting, broad agency announcements, challenges and prizes) to ensure procurements can capture flexible and rapidly changing technology advancements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prize challenge will include three phases. <br /><strong>Phase I</strong> asks for participants to submit a white paper that describes their concept for a training and development program that will meet the stated objectives. Up to three Phase I submissions will be selected as finalists and move to <br /><strong>Phase II</strong>. These finalists are awarded $20,000 each in prize money to design in more detail their proposed concept program. At the end of Phase II, these finalists will present their in-depth program designs at an oral presentation and a one hour mock classroom training to a panel of Federal senior leaders. One winner will be selected and moves to <br /><strong>Phase III</strong>, which requires that participant to develop and pilot its program for approximately 30 students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Phase III<strong>,</strong> up to $250,000 in milestone payments will be provided to assist the participant in developing their proposed pilot for a training and development program that can be easily adopted and implemented by the Government. Upon completion of Phase III, the finalist can win up to $50,000 in additional prize money for developing a program that fully met the stated objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pilot will be held in the Washington, DC area with local students. However, approaches for the proposed program that include virtual components to allow participation of students outside of the Washington, DC area (with some in-person sessions required) and/or self-pacing are highly encouraged, but must also demonstrate cost effectiveness.    <a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[i]</a> <a href="http://www.fai.gov/drupal/sites/default/files/2006-1-20-OMB-Memo-FAC-C-Certification.pdf">http://www.fai.gov/drupal/sites/default/files/2006-1-20-OMB-Memo-FAC-C-Certification.pdf</a>    <a href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2">[ii]</a>¬†<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/digitalgov/digital-services-governance-recommendations">http://www.whitehouse.gov/digitalgov/digital-services-governance-recommendations&lt;/span&gt;</a>    <a href="#_ednref3" name="_edn3">[iii]</a><a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">https://playbook.cio.gov/&lt;/span&gt;</a><a href="#_ednref4" name="_edn4">[iv]</a><a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/techfar">https://playbook.cio.gov/techfar</a>    <a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1">[i]</a>¬† <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/procurement/memo/simplifying-federal-procurement-to-improve-performance-drive-innovation-increase-savings.pdf">http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/procurement/memo/simplifying-federal-procurement-to-improve-performance-drive-innovation-increase-savings.pdf</a>.</p>
