I"ñ<p>Did you know that every year the Federal government&nbsp;invests over $135 billion in research and development? Almost one-third of these funds support intramural research - by Federal researchers within Federal laboratories - covering a wide range of technologies with applications in aerospace, biotechnology, chemical engineering, communications, electronics, and much, much more. Many of the technologies developed by Federal researchers are transferred to the private sector through formal agreements (e.g. patents, licenses, or cooperative research and development agreements) or through informal exchanges (e.g. publications, conference presentations or collaborations).&nbsp;Without doubt these Federal investments have yielded extraordinary long-term impacts, creating new knowledge and ultimately new industries. But we need more efforts to quantify these impacts. How can we most accurately and completely capture the economic and societal impact&nbsp;of federal technology transfer activities?&nbsp;This challenge calls on you to analyze a federally-developed technology that has been transferred to the private sector, and present the results in a paper suitable for an archival publication.</p>
<p><strong>Why this Challenge?</strong></p>
<p>Despite the proliferation of Federal research and the profound effect that many Federally-developed technologies have upon our everyday life, more effort is needed&nbsp;to assess the impact of these technologies -- as emphasized in President Obama's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/10/28/presidential-memorandum-accelerating-technology-transfer-and-commerciali" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2011 Memorandum Accelerating Technology Transfer and Commercialization of Federal Research in Support of High-Growth Businesses</a>. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Journal of Technology Transfer aim to stimulate efforts in this area through this Challenge.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Federally developed technology?</strong></p>
<p>Eligible technologies for this Challenge must meet two criteria, namely 1) the technology must have been developed in whole or in part by a Federal employee(s) during the course of their employment duties at any time over the past 30 years, and 2) the technology must have been transferred in a manner that can be traced back to the agency.&nbsp;Information about federally transferred technologies and technology transfer success stories can be found on the Federal Laboratories Consortium (FLC) website at <a href="http://www.federallabs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.federallabs.org</a>. &nbsp; See&nbsp;a list of Federal agencies that prepare annual <a href="http://nist.gov/tpo/publications/agency-technology-transfer-reports.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technology transfer reports</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How do I assess one?</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this Challenge is to identify and measure economic and societal impacts&nbsp;that result from the transfer of&nbsp;Federally developed technologies.</p>
<ul> <li>First, &nbsp;identify a technology that was developed in a Federal agency. Information about federally transferred technologies can be found on the Federal Laboratories Consortium (FLC) website at <a href="http://www.federallabs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.federallabs.org</a> as well as individual Federal agency websites, including NIST's <a href="https://www.nist.gov/tpo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Technology Partnerships Office</a>. NIST provides&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.nist.gov/tpo/agency-technology-transfer-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of Federal agencies that issue annual technology transfer reports</a>.</li> <li>Next, research the impact of this technology by examining&nbsp;who is using the technology,&nbsp;how they are using it, and what impacts have resulted from its use.&nbsp; Impacts may be assessed at the local, regional, national, or global levels using economic data or other societal data (e.g., measures of health, safety, or security).</li> <li>Finally,&nbsp;prepare an original paper describing your research and the impact that you have identified. Your paper should clearly describe the technology you are assessing and include evidence of how it has been used since being transferred. &nbsp;Note that a variety of assessment methodologies could be used by Participants in this Challenge including, but not limited to, <a href="https://www.nist.gov/tpo/nist-economic-impact-studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIST's economic impact studies</a> and these&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nist.gov/tpo/other-agency-economic-impact-studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">examples of commonly used approaches</a>.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Who should participate?</strong></p>
<p>This Challenge is open to anyone (or any organization) that meets the eligibility requirements described in the Rules. You do not need to be a technology expert or economist,&nbsp;but you should have an appetite for research and some familiarity with methods of impact analysis. Teaming is encouraged because of the scope and diversity of potential technology transfer studies, from understanding the technology to tracking its transfer&nbsp;and assessing its impact.</p>
<p><strong>To enter:</strong></p>
<p>Submit a research paper that identifies a federally developed technology and analyzes the economic or social or economic impact that occurred as a result of it being transferred outside of the federal agency in which it was developed.&nbsp; If your paper is selected as a winner, you will receive a $5,000 cash award and you will be invited to have your paper considered for publication in&nbsp;<em>The Journal of Technology Transfer</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Before you begin,&nbsp;carefully review the Rules to make sure you are eligible to Participate and for more details&nbsp;about&nbsp;the Challenge.
