<p>Legacy aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) used by the Department of Defense (DoD) as a firefighting foam is facing increasing regulatory scrutiny throughout the world due to environmental and human health concerns associated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS are persistent in the environment, and the DoD will be requiring PFAS-free firefighting agents in the near future. The DoDâ€™s Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) and Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) are tasked with developing and demonstrating PFAS-free firefighting agents for use as a replacement for legacy AFFF.</p>

<p>This challenge provides an opportunity for individuals and firms of various sizes to contribute to the development of an AFFF alternative by submitting innovative formulations that can approach and match the capabilities of legacy AFFF. The submitter will initially demonstrate these capabilities by performing a small pan fire extinguishing test as described later in this document and in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S2XEpmXMJw">supporting video</a>.</p>
