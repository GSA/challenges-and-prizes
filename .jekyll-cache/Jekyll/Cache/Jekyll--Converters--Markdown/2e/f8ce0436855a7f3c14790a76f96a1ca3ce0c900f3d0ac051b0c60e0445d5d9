<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;strong&gt;The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) “America’s Seed Fund” Logo Design Competition, pursuant to the America Competes Act&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt; is seeking submissions from artists and/or designers &lt;em&gt;to create a thoughtful and imaginative visual representation of the government's largest innovation effort focused on research-driven, innovative and cutting-edge small businesses&lt;/em&gt; through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs. &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our tag-line is 12 Agencies...1 Vision: Seed The Future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background Info:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    The SBIR/STTR Programs are extremely competitive and encourage small businesses to engage in federally funded research and development (R&amp;amp;D) through eleven Federal agencies with R&amp;amp;D needs. SBIR/STTR awards enable small businesses to explore their technological potential, stimulate innovation to meet federal R&amp;amp;D needs, and potentially profit from private-sector commercialization of developed technologies. Since inception in 1982, 150,000 awards totaling $40 billion have been awarded to the small firms that participate. The programs touch, catalyze and seed the creation of STEM driven innovations in industries critical to the nation's long term competitiveness and growth - from nanotech to robotics to mobile communications to genetic therapies to clean energy to advanced weapons to space exploration. Many of today’s technology giants – or their underlying technological components – received seed funding through SBIR or STTR awards via the eleven participating Federal agencies; the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Home Land Security and Transportation. (Visit the &lt;em&gt;sbir.gov&lt;/em&gt; website at &lt;a href="https://www.sbir.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;https://www.sbir.gov/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more information.)    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prize:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    The new logo will serve as the official logo for the SBIR/STTR Programs to be used for promotional and educational information, including but not limited to, the Programs’ website, SBA’s website, participating Federal agency websites, conferences, events, television, print, and other media outlets. &lt;strong&gt;The winner of the competition will receive $2,500 and their winning logo is intended to be unveiled at the 2015 Tibbetts Awards ceremony on June 15, 2015, at The White House and also be highlighted at the National SBIR Conference, June 15-17, 2015 at the Gaylord Hotel &amp;amp; Convention Center at The National Harbor in Washington DC.&lt;/strong&gt;
