Specific instructions and deadlines are described below.    <em>Registration Form:</em>Â <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/xTechSearch-Registration-Form.pdf">xTechSearch-Registration-Form</a>    Â     <strong>Background Information:</strong>    The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA(ALT)) is announcing the Army Expeditionary Technology Search â€“ xTechSearch â€“ to be featured at the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C., on 8 to 10 October 2018. xTechSearch will highlight opportunities for nontraditional defense partners to collaborate with the Army to tackle the most poignant Army modernization challenges.    The ASA(ALT) recognizes that the Army must enhance engagements with the entrepreneurial funded community, small businesses, and other non-traditional defense partners, by: (1) understanding the spectrum of technologies being developed commercially that may benefit the Army; (2) integrating the sector of nontraditional innovators into the Armyâ€™s research and development ecosystem; and (3) providing mentorship and expertise to accelerate, mature, and transition technologies of interest to the Army.    Pursuant to Title 15, United States Code, Section 3719, the xTechSearch competition will provide prizes to select businesses for innovative technologies and ideas that can solve Army challenges. The program will also integrate these nontraditional innovators into the Armyâ€™s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) ecosystem by providing cooperative research opportunities with Army labs, including access to the Armyâ€™s organic intellectual and technical capital. xTechSearch is an opportunity for small businesses to pitch technology solutions â€“ a new application for an existing technology or a new technology concept entirely â€“ to the Army.    xTechSearch is a novel approach for linking innovators directly with the Army labs, with a focus on lowering the entrance barriers and spurring innovation.    Â     <strong>Eligibility Requirements:</strong>    The entities allowed to participate in this competition are small businesses as defined in 13 C.F.R. Part 121. To qualify, the participating entity must fall within the size standard by North American Industry Classification System code 541713, 541714, and 541715.    There may be only one submission per business. In addition, each entity:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Shall provide registration information in the xTechSearch Cover Letter registration form;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Shall perform the work in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;May not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Registered participants shall be required to agree to assume any and all risks and waive claims against the Federal Government and its related entities, except in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue, or profits, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising from their participation in a prize competition, whether the injury, death, damage, or loss arises through negligence or otherwise.    Participants shall be required to obtain liability insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility, in amounts determined by the Army, for claims byâ€”  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Third parties for death, bodily injury, or property damage, or loss resulting from an activity carried out in connection with participation in a prize competition, with the Federal Government named as an additional insured under the registered participantâ€™s insurance policy and registered participants agreeing to indemnify the Federal Government against third party claims for damages arising from or related to prize competition activities; and&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Federal Government for damage or loss to Government property resulting from such an activity.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Â     <strong>Intellectual property</strong>    The Army is a strong proponent of deliberate intellectual property (IP) rights and management by the private sector and the Department of Defense. A deliberate and commercially oriented IP management posture will foster greater innovation while preventing the loss of military technologies to open sources which may benefit adversaries. Enhanced IP management, coupled with modularity and open system architecture, improves our ability to deliver systems that can be readily adapted to partner needs and integrated with their existing systems while advancing interoperability.    For the xTechSearch program:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The Federal Government may not gain an interest in IP developed by a participant without the written consent of the participant;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Nothing in the xTechSearch prize competition shall diminish the Governmentâ€™s rights in patents, technical data, technical information, computer software, computer databases and computer software documentation that the Government had prior to this xTechSearch prize competition, or is entitled to, under any other Government Agreement of contract, or is otherwise entitled to under law; and&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The Federal Government may negotiate a license for the use of IP developed by a registered participant in the prize competition.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Â     <strong>Technology Focus Areas:</strong>    The Army wants the innovation community to explore the full ideation space and the art-of-the-possible. The ASA(ALT) is soliciting innovative, paradigm-breaking technologies from the nontraditional defense community to support the following Army modernization priorities:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<u>Long Range Precision Fires</u>. Provide massed, mobile, operational-level kinetic and non-kinetic strike options to restore overmatch, improve deterrence, and disrupt Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD) on a complex, contested, and expanded battlefield. Potential technology areas include:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Propulsion for extended long-range missiles&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Extended range cannon artillery&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Enhanced guidance/navigation for weapon systems&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Advanced energetics&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Advanced warheads for cluster munitions&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Next-generation RADARs&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<u>Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV)</u>. Develop replacements for current tanks and infantry fighting vehicles that realize weight, sustainment, and cost-per-unit savings. This will increase the capability of our existing formations and improve our ability to survive and win in the complex and densely urbanized terrain of an intensely lethal and distributed battlefield where all domains are continually contested. Potential technology areas include:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;NGCV Design&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Vehicle Protection against advanced threats&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Robotics and autonomy for combat operations and logistics&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Advanced power generation&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Advanced materials&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Efficient Manned-Unmanned Teaming Constructs&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Autonomy&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<u>Future Vertical Lift (FVL)</u> to develop replacement aviation platforms that include unmanned and autonomous attack, reconnaissance, utility, and MEDEVAC with increased speed and extended range and station time to operate in complex, dense urban terrain on an intensely lethal, distributed, and expanded battlefield within contested air space. Potential technology areas include:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Platform development and demonstration&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Next-generation unmanned aircraft system technologies&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Aviation protection and aircraft survivability&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Improved situational awareness&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Integrated Mission Systems&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Advanced power systems&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Efficient Manned-Unmanned Teaming Constructs&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Autonomy&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<u>Network</u> <u>with</u><u> hardware, software, and infrastructure</u> to provide resilient mission command on the move to wage the maneuver ISR, joint fires, and sustainment fights to retain and exploit the initiative against a peer adversary in an inherently contested cyber and electromagnetic environment. Potential technology areas include:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Secure Tactical Communications&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Interoperable hardware, software, and information systems&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Cyber Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Assured Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<u>Air and Missile Defense</u> to reduce the cost curve of missile defense, restore overmatch, survive volley-fire attacks, and operate within sophisticated A2/AD and contested domains. Potential technology areas include:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Smaller and more affordable missiles&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;High Energy Lasers&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Gun-based counter-tactical and small unmanned air systems (UAS) capabilities&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Advanced seekers&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Advanced energetics and propulsion&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Next-generation RADARs&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<u>Soldier Lethality</u> to improve Soldier and small unit performance, reduce surprise, increase protection, and enhance lethality in close combat on an intensely lethal and distributed battlefield and within complex, urban terrain. Potential technology areas include:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Advanced lethality and projection&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Training&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Improved Soldier protection equipment&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Improved situational awareness and communications&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Optimized and enhanced human performance&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Asymmetric Vision and Decide Faster technologies&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Prolonged field medical care&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Â     <strong>Proposal Submission</strong>    The xTechSearch program is voluntary and open to all interested traditional and nontraditional small businesses. xTechSearch is an opportunity for businesses to pitch novel technology solutions â€“ a new application for an existing technology or a new technology concept entirely â€“ to the Army.
