<p>The xTechSearch competition is voluntary and open to all entities that meet the eligibility requirements. There may be only one submission per eligible entity. The registration information and upload submission must be received by <strong>5:00 PM ET on September 2, 2021</strong>. Submissions received after the deadline will not be considered.</p>

<p>All xTechSearch submissions are treated as privileged information and contents are disclosed to Government employees or designated support contractors only for the purpose of evaluation and program support.</p>

<p>Detailed feedback will be provided to all participants at the end of each phase. The purpose of providing this feedback is to help accelerate transition of the technology to an Army user by providing insight on best applications for the technology within the Army, suggestions for product improvement for Army use, and recommended next steps for development. However, the Government will not respond to questions or inquiries regarding this feedback.</p>

<p>While the authority of this program is 10 U.S.C. § 2374a, a concept white paper submitted to the xTech Program may generate interest by another Army organization for a funding opportunity outside of this program (e.g., submission of a proposal under a Broad Agency Announcement). The interested Army organization may contact the participant to provide additional information.</p>

<p><strong>Submission Format</strong></p>

<p>The xTechSearch Part 1 submission is a 2-page concept white paper. Please adhere to the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All concept white papers must be submitted using the template found on the Valid Eval registration page, “xTechSearch_6_WhitePaper_Template.doc”. Any proposals submitted in a format other than that provided by the template will not be reviewed, please read all instructions on the first page of the template document carefully.</li>
  <li>Please list your company name, and proposal title EXACTLY how you would like them to appear on any contest marketing materials, recommend clear and concise proposal titles to give readers and potential stakeholders understanding of how your technology would benefit the Army.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Army Focus Areas</strong></p>

<p>xTechSearch is seeking novel, disruptive concepts and technology solutions with dual-use capabilities that can assist in tackling the Army’s current needs and be applied to current Army concepts. The intent is to provide the Army with transformative technology solutions while enabling cost savings throughout the Army systems’ life cycle. Critical technology focus areas include Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML); Advanced Materials; Advanced Manufacturing; Autonomy; Cyber; Electronics; Human Performance; Immersive; Network Technologies; Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT); Power; Software Modernization; and Sensors. See attached document on the Valid Eval registration page for a list of the top Army Modernization Priorities and other critical Army Focus Areas.</p>

<p><strong>xTechSearch Application Process</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Part 1:  Concept White Paper</em></strong>
All eligible entities are invited to submit a 2-page concept white paper outlining their technology, the potential impact on the Army, technology and concept viability, and descriptions of the dual-use technology applications for both the commercial and defense space.
