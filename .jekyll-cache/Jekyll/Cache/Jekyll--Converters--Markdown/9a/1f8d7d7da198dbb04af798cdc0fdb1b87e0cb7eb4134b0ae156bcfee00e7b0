I"t<p>The National Park Service (NPS), the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), and Van Alen Institute are collaborating on Memorials for the Future, an ideas competition to reimagine how we think about, feel, and experience memorials with the <strong>Memorials for the Future</strong> challenge.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;p&gt;Memorials enshrine what we as a society want to remember. But the places, people, and stories that we memorialize, and the audiences who engage with them are constantly changing. A memorial tells its story through subject matter and design. This story is often complex and multi-dimensional, as a memorial's interpretive elements embody ideas of identity, culture, and heritage, and each has intensely personal interpretations for every individual.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As a national capital, Washington is a place of collective memory. The wealth of monuments sited throughout the city take on heightened significance as they reflect relationships among nations, of national remembrance, and of many important events and figures in our history. Often the traditional and fixed nature of memorial design does not allow for adaptation and redefinition over time and does not encourage more than one interpretation of a given narrative.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The traditional approach to developing memorials in Washington has resulted in a commemorative landscape that is thematically similar and increasingly land-intensive, which poses challenges for Washington, and has long-term implications for the potential uses of a memorial's surrounding park setting.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The planning and design process is often costly and lengthy, which limits opportunities to groups or individuals with significant resources. Current trends raise a number of questions about the future of Washington's memorial landscape and the ability to provide space and resources for future commemorative works.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memorials for the Future&lt;/strong&gt; calls for designers, artists, and social scientists to develop new ways to commemorate people and events that are more inclusive and flexible, and that enrich Washington's landscape while responding to the limitations of traditional commemoration. As NPS celebrates its centennial in 2016, Memorials for the Future creates new ideas for honoring our diverse histories, heritage, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The entries will be narrowed to three teams to participate in a research and design process, working closely with the competition partners to develop site-specific designs for memorials in Washington D.C. that are adaptive, ephemeral, virtual, event-focused, or interactive. The teams' proposals will advance a framework for the design of 21st-century memorials and provide future memorial sponsors with fresh approaches to commemorating their subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;    The goals of the competition are to create new approaches to and forms of memorializing:  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;That advance a framework for the planning and design of commemorative works in the 21st century.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;That demonstrate how temporary, mobile, interactive or adaptive displays can provide powerful and memorable experiences that are cost-efficient.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;That develop ways to commemorate that are inclusive of multiple narratives and have the potential to be flexible as perspectives change.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;That Honor the scale, context and national significance of Washington, DC.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The competition results will be displayed online and at an exhibition in Washington D.C., published in an illustrated report, and will inform NPS, NCPC, and their partners on future design and policy opportunities.    The deadline for registration and electronic submission of the Request for Concepts is &lt;strong&gt;11:59 p.m. EDT on May 4, 2016&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;PHASES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase I&lt;/strong&gt; – Initial Application  April 11 – May 4, 2016    Applications from multidisciplinary teams for this Request for Concepts are due May 4, 2016. (See submission requirements below for more information on applying.) Phase I will conclude on May 30, 2016, with the notification of the three teams selected to participate in the competition.    Finalist teams will attend a launch event in Washington, DC, on June 8, 2016 and June 9, 2016. Teams will present their initial proposals to the competition partners, advisory committee, and any public attendees.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase II&lt;/strong&gt; – Research and Design Concept  June 8 – July 10, 2016    Over the course of the subsequent five weeks, teams will continue to conduct research and refine designs. Teams will participate in weekly calls with competition partners during which they will show in-progress work (via PDF sent beforehand). Teams are expected to incorporate feedback from the competition partners throughout the five-week process.    For one to two days during the week of July 11, 2016, teams will reconvene for a design framework mid-review working session.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase III&lt;/strong&gt; – Final Designs  July 11 – August 1, 2016    Teams will have between three and four weeks to develop their final memorial proposals. During this period, teams will participate in weekly calls with competition partners and show in-progress materials via PDF.    For one to two days during the week of August 1, teams will meet again for a final design presentation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase IV&lt;/strong&gt; – Exhibition Development and Installation  August 1 – September 8, 2016    During the time period between the final review and exhibition launch, teams will participate in weekly calls with competition partners and show in-progress materials for the exhibition via PDF.    &lt;strong&gt;TIMELINE&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;April 18, 2016 – Pre-registration Deadline (Encouraged but not required)&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;May 4, 2016 – Submission DeadlinE&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Early June 2016 – Top Three Finalist Teams NotifieD&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;June 8, 2016 – Competition Launch Event&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Mid-July, 2016 – Design Framework Working Session (Exact dates TBD)&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Early August, 2016 – Final Presentation&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;August 8, 2016 – Final Deliverables Due&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;September 8, 2016 – Announcement of Competition Winner &amp;amp; Exhibition Launch&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
