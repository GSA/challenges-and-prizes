I"l<p>In recognition of Native American Heritage Month, the&nbsp;National Institutes of Health (NIH) announces the &ldquo;Storytelling about Health and Wellness in American Indian and Alaska Native Communities&rdquo; Challenge. The goal of this Challenge is to develop a brief digital story (i.e., a video) that communicates how traditions and heritage promote health in American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN).&nbsp;The NIH invites the public to participate to share stories about:&nbsp; 1) how heritage and tradition leads to health and wellness in AI/AN communities; and 2) how future research can improve the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives.&nbsp;The videos will augment the agency&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to inform a strengthened research portfolio that advances AI/AN research needs. This challenge is also designed to attract more interest and attention to the research needs of these communities and communicate these needs in a culturally appropriate manner.</p>
<p>Submissions are limited to a video that may not exceed five minutes. Submissions must be substantially free of scientific jargon and understandable by viewers without scientific/technical backgrounds. The video must include at least one member of a federally recognized tribe(s) and address the following:</p>
<ul> <li>A brief historical background that puts the story in context. For example, what is the traditional or cultural practice? How does it contribute to health and wellness in AI/AN populations?</li> <li>A description of how this tradition or culture affects people&rsquo;s lives. The impact could be lives saved, suffering reduced, fewer visits to health care facilities, adopting a healthier lifestyle, and similar such benefits. How is this practice promoted within tribal populations?</li> <li>Information about the unmet health and wellness needs of AI/AN communities. What is the unmet need? Is there an understanding of what interventions or actions may help address these needs?</li> <li>A discussion of how biomedical or behavioral research can further Tribal health and wellness. What are the current gaps in Tribal health research and opportunities for improving health in AI/AN communities?&nbsp; What are some of the barriers or challenges in closing these gaps?&nbsp; How would addressing them reduce mortality, improve quality of life, or otherwise positively affect Tribal communities? &nbsp;The video must convey the research question of interest as part of a holistic picture of Tribal health or AI/AN communities.</li> </ul>
<p>Contestants must include a link to a public or unlisted video on YouTube.com, Vimeo.com, or other internet accessible site. The submission may be disqualified if the video is primarily promotional, contains inappropriate material or language, or presents material unrelated to this challenge, as determined by the NIH. &nbsp;A video must:</p>
<ul> <li>Be in English if dialogue is present. Use of Native language is encouraged but must include an English caption or other method of translation to English.</li> <li>Be no longer than five minutes. The NIH recognizes that there may be a desire to prepare a longer video. However, any part of a video exceeding five minutes will be disregarded as part of the judging process.</li> <li>Not include copyrighted material, such as music or photos, unless the Contestant has obtained written permission to use such material.</li> <li>Not include proprietary information.</li> <li>For any video with dialogue, captioning must be included or a written transcript of the video must be submitted in English to ensure the video can be understood by viewers with disabilities. <ul> <li>The video must remain posted at the URL submitted with the entry for at least one year after the Challenge closes. The video (or the link to it) may be displayed publicly on the NIH web site.</li> <li>Before posting a video online, a Contestant must obtain consent from anyone appearing in the video. If a minor appears in the video, the contestant must obtain consent from the minor&rsquo;s parent or legal guardian.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<h4>Technical Evaluation Panel</h4>
<p>Submissions first will be assessed by a technical evaluation panel consisting of individuals who will review the relevance of the entry to the AI/AN communities, the accuracy of the advance and impact on AI/ANs, cultural sensitivity, and confirmation of the unmet research need(s) in AI/AN populations.</p>
