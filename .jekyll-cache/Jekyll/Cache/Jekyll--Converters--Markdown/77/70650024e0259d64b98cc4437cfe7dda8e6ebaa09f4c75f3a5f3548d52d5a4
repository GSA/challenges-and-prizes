I"Y!<p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION</strong>    The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to being green, because we believe a green planet is a happy planet.  At GSA, we know that sustainability helps federal agencies meet their missions today, without sacrificing their ability to serve future generations.  But we can’t do it without you!  That’s why we’re inviting you to participate in the Government-wide Earth Day Hackathon, hosted by GSA’s <span style="font-weight: 400;">Office of Citizen Services, and, Innovative Technologies and 18F (OCSIT/18F)</span>.  We hope to see you on Earth Day, April 22, 2016, as we work together to keep our planet green and clean.    The goal of this competition is to have industry, academia and government develop smart technology solutions in the form of an application, application programming interface (API), web/mobile application, data mashup, and dashboards that have the capability to provide GSA with key insights and recommendations for future enhancements.    All coders, developers, designers, engineers, data scientists, and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from industry, academia, and federal government are invited to participate.  Participants will be competing on self-selected teams to develop smart technology solutions.    GSA’s OCSIT/18F Organization will be partnering with the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the General Services Administration (GSA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the United States Forest Service (USFS).    <strong>PROJECTS - </strong>Listed below are the agency challenges that will be presented at the Earth Day Hackathon:  &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;<strong>White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)</strong>&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;<strong>Federal Dashboard on Sustainable Purchasing: </strong>Create a visual dashboard on sustainable purchasing by agencies using data captured in the government-wide procurement system.  Show which agencies are putting their dollars towards environmentally sustainable products and services.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong><strong>Assessment of Wildfire Hazard Location for Federal and Public Users: </strong></strong>Create a website or app that allows federal agencies or the public to assess whether or not their property is located in an area of wildfire risk as defined by the Wildland Urban Interface guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;<strong>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</strong>&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Develop a Method to Identify Fraudulent Reporting to the EPA:</strong> Using Benford’s law of statistical probability, build a tool to scan environmental data from industries or other regulated entities to identify potential cases of fraudulent reporting.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Tailored UV Index Forecast for Beaches: </strong>The UV Index, a numeric index of the strength of cancer-causing UV rays from the sun, is a forecast produced by the National Weather Service.  The forecast data are run through the EPA’s Envirofacts and put out to the public through our app and widget.  The app has been featured on nationwide media and TV.  Develop code that can be deployed on Android and iOS mobile apps that displays UV Index forecast information specific to a defined beach.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Climate Change Indicators Report: </strong>The Office of Air has published several climate-related indicators and datasets.  Develop improved data visualizations or a consolidated dashboard associated with the climate change indicator data.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Geofence Application to Improve Environmental Awareness: </strong>Develop a mobile app that improves environmental awareness through the use of geo-fences.  User would get a push notification of the presence of a green infrastructure project, wilderness area, habitat restoration or other projects from Geo Grants that the EPA has funded.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;<strong>GSA</strong>&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;<strong>Simplifying Sustainable Procurement: </strong>Make it easier for purchasers to buy green products by filling out procurement forms automatically while shopping on the web.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;<strong>Sustainable Decision-Making for Building Project Management:</strong> Build a streamlined management tool to help teams collaborate and incorporate sustainability into any building project.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;<strong>Sustainable Facility Camera App:</strong> Build an app that allows a user to take a photo of products, building materials, and systems and receive green tips and sustainable purchasing information.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;<strong>Sustainable Reordering:</strong> Help purchasers order green products while out in the world or checking physical inventory via a barcode-scanning app that populated procurement forms.  Phone application that allows a user to scan a barcode, looks up the product and notifies the user whether it meets latest sustainability requirements.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;<strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</strong>&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;<strong>Environmentally Friendly Product Selection Web Interface API: </strong>Our goal for the competition, is to develop a new web application that allows for selection and comparison of building products across their economic and environmental performance based on the user’s specific needs and preferences.  The application should be able to collect user inputs from a graphical user interface, use those inputs to select data from a database or csv files, apply some business rules on the data and then display the data in the form of a graph, table and downloadable data file.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;<strong>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</strong>&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;<strong>Offering Dynamic Climate Normals for Custom Applications: </strong>An API, browser extension or add-on (for Internet Explorer or Chrome) that allows users to compute their custom normals from NOAA’s records of surface temperature and precipitation.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;<strong>Enabling Discovery of NOAA NEXRAD Data on the Commercial Cloud: </strong>An API that allows users to easily find NEXRAD data that is pertinent to their application.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;<strong>Exploiting NOAA’s New Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) Precipitation and Severe Weather Mosaic Products: </strong>An app, browser extension or add-on (for Internet Explorer or Chrome) that allows users to visualize and/or compute on NOAA’s records of severe weather and precipitation.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;<strong>USDA</strong>&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Energy and Water Use in Forest Service Facilities:  </strong>Develop methods to present and compare performance on energy and water use in Forest Service facilities.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Using existing data from several sources, integrate the data and perform analysis to present absolute and relative performance in an easy-to-understand fashion, allowing “apples-to-apples” comparisons.</span>&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;<strong>U.S. Forest Service</strong>&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Develop a web and phone app tool that assigns a “shade index” to neighborhoods<i>:  </i></strong>Develop a prototype of a tool that allows users to quickly and easily access shade scores for any neighborhood in the United States.  Ideally this tool would be available on the web and as a phone app. </span>&lt;/li&gt;
