I"ˇ;<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is looking for innovative, effective,
and replicable approaches to building a diverse and inclusive science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce through
partnerships. As an NSF initiative with a mission to enhance U.S. leadership
in STEM by facilitating partnerships, NSF INCLUDES is sponsoring to the NSF
STEM DIVE Challenge.</p>

<p>NSF invites grantees from all NSF programs to showcase, in the form of a short
video (1 to 3 minutes), how forging partnerships, networks, or alliances has
contributed to an increase in diversity and inclusion in STEM. All entries
must be submitted by a Principal Investigator (PI) or Co-PI on any previous or
current funded NSF award. These videos will be used by NSF and its programs in
various platforms (e.g. websites, fair exhibitions, printed materials) to
exhibit how grantees have encouraged and supported diversity and inclusion in
STEM preK-12, higher, and informal education. This challenge is also designed
to attract more broader interest in STEM and to inform the greater community
on best practices for increasing diversity and inclusion, effective
partnership and networking strategies, and dissemination approaches for
growing the STEM workforce.</p>

<p>Entrants must be a PI or Co-PI of a current or expired National Science
Foundation (NSF) grant or cooperative agreement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>May be an individual or a team of up to four people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Must be a U.S. citizens or permanent residents, or legal residents in the
U.S. by June 24, 2020</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Employment requirements can be located at
<em><a href="http://www.nsf.gov/ehr/stemdive.jsp">www.nsf.gov/ehr/stemdive.jsp</a></em></p>

<p>Cash prizes will be issued to the registered team leader. It is the team and
team leader‚Äôs responsibility to determine whether and how prizes will be
shared among team members and to implement such sharing arrangements.</p>

<p>In addition to cash prizes, winning videos will be posted on NSF‚Äôs Education
Human Resources Directorate web page and the NSF INCLUDES National Network on
<a href="https://www.includesnetwork.org/" target="_blank">https://www.includesnetwork.‚Äãorg</a>.
Should NSF decide to bring winning entrants to Washington, D.C., or to any
other location for promotional and other purposes, expenses paid by NSF for
entrants‚Äô travel will be within the limits set forth in law according to
federal travel regulations.</p>

<p>Videos will be judged on approach, impact and sustainability; visual appeal;
effective communication; and originality.</p>

<p><strong>Key dates:</strong> The Challenge begins on March 24, 2020. All video entries must
be uploaded to YouTube and written entries submitted by 11:00 p.m. ET on June

<h3 id="judging-criteria">Judging Criteria</h3>

<p>Judges will be a panel of STEM researchers, educators, and other professionals
at NSF, the NSF awardee community, and the broader public. They will evaluate,
score, and rank submissions to determine winner(s) in the Informal STEM
Education, PreK-12 STEM Education, STEM Higher Education, and STEM Alliances
entry categories. Entries will be evaluated based on: Approach, Impact, and
Sustainability; Visual Appeal; Effective Communication; and Originality. NSF
will make final determinations and award all prize winners.</p>

<p>The judging panel will use a 100-point scale to evaluate the videos. The scale
will rank the extent to which the video can demonstrate the following:</p>

<p><strong><em>Approach, Impact and Sustainability (40pts)</em></strong></p>

<p>A successful entry must display an executed concept that has encouraged and
supported diversifying and developing a competent U.S. STEM workforce of
scientists, technicians, engineers, mathematicians and educators through
partnerships. A successful entry should clearly define the approach taken to
the work. Impact can be measured in the number of people reached, policies
developed, programs created, and partnerships forged. In the case of social
media, the following numbers should be indicated: views, readers, citations,
subscribers, retweets or shares, and public responses. An entry should
demonstrate how the effort(s) could or have been sustained within your
organization and disseminated to the wider STEM community.</p>

<p><strong><em>Visual Appeal (15pts)</em></strong></p>

<p>A successful entry provides viewers with a visually striking, unique, clean,
and creative technical approach to video production. The video must have a
high level of audibility and visual quality. The entry must be polished and
professional and must be executed with factual accuracy.</p>

<p><strong><em>Effective Communication (25pts)</em></strong></p>

<p>A successful entry communicates in a clear and understandable manner. It uses
plain language, both written and spoken. The written entry description and
caption must be presented at a level and using language that can be understood
by the general public, which includes a broad audience of varying ages and
backgrounds. Use of technical terminology and assumption of prior knowledge of
STEM concepts in the video should be limited.</p>

<p><strong><em>Originality (20pts)</em></strong></p>

<p>A successful entry creates a novel presentation or tells a compelling story
and portrays new insight and approaches to broadening diversity in STEM.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-enter">How To Enter</h3>

<p>Entrants must post their video submission to YouTube as an unlisted video and
send the link to their video entry along with the required submission forms to
<a href="mailto:stemdive@nsf.gov">stemdive@nsf.gov</a> by the deadline.</p>
