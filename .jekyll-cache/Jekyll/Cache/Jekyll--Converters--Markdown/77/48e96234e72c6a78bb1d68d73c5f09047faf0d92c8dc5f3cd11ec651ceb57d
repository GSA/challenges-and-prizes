<p>A judging panel will be composed of a hybrid team, both internal and external to NASA</p>
<p><strong>Judging Criteria</strong></p>
<p>To qualify to be judged, teams must provide a completed application package, submit a video of the system operating properly and have an interview by phone with a judge. The judge will determine is a team has sufficiently completed the required criteria and the judge will schedule a site visit with the team. The judging panel's evaluation of the submissions will be based on the following scoring criteria:</p>
<p>Product Quality Assessment (100 points)':' Each team must host a judge for an on-site visit. During this visit, a team must successfully demonstrate the operation of their system and produce enough sample within 7 hours to be analyzed and scored. The product will be collected and analyzed by an independent laboratory for the presence of D-enantiomers of targeted simple sugars. Teams will be assigned scores based on the presence of targeted compounds.</p>
