I"'<p>Participants will submit white papers on viability of improving performance of aerospace fuels using synthetic biology and biotechnology.</p>

<p>In the first phase of this contest, participants will submit white papers on viability of the approach to biosynthesize a high-energy endothermic fuel. In phase 2, these white papers will be down selected to the viable entries (potential awardees). These selectees will be given 2 weeks to enter into a subsequent agreement with a US company that can scale up their production concept and demonstrate the capability to manufacture testable amounts (if they cannot manufacture it themselves). These teams will be invited to present a 1-hour pitch of their concept and scale up strategy with their manufacturing partner (if needed) to the evaluation team.</p>
