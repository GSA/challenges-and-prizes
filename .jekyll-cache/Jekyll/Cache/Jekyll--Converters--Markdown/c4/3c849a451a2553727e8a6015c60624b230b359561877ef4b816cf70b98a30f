<p><strong>Thank you for the interest in the Aspire Challenge and to all contestants who submitted potential solutions.  Award decisions under this challenge are delayed. Once we have further information, we will notify all contestants via email and on www.challenge.gov/aspire-challenge.  </strong>  &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;<strong><strong>END STATUS UPDATE 3/14/2017</strong></strong>&lt;/p&gt;       The Aspire Challenge is a prize competition conducted under the America Competes Act. The objective of this competition is to spur the development and provision of innovative entrepreneurial development and access to capital resources for formerly incarcerated individuals or those who are non-violent ex-offenders. The submission period for entries will begin on December 29, 2016 and close on February 12, 2017. The SBA anticipates that winners will be announced no later than March 14, 2017.    The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) official established in 1953, maintains and strengthens the nation’s economy by aiding, counseling, assisting, and protecting the interests of small business, and by helping families and businesses to recover from national disasters. The SBA’s mission includes assisting small businesses to start, grow, and compete in markets by providing quality training, counseling, and access to resources.    Providing meaningful economic opportunities to individuals who have completed prison sentences is a critical solution to an increasingly alarming problem.  Of the 600,000 individuals released on average each year from federal prisons, an estimated 60 percent remain unemployed one year after their release, raising the risk of recidivism and resulting in lost lifetime earnings. In fact, two-thirds of these individuals historically are rearrested within three years of their release.    This challenge competition is separate but builds on the momentum of the Aspire Entrepreneurship Initiative, a public-private partnership announced in August 2016 between the SBA, W.K. Kellogg Foundation, and Justine PETERSEN. The three-year initiative is a pilot to test entrepreneurship education programming and microloan assistance through SBA Microloan Intermediaries to formerly-incarcerated individuals in St. Louis, MO; Chicago, IL; Louisville, KY; and Detroit, MI. The goal of the Aspire Challenge is to source additional innovative solutions in other areas in the United States beyond these four metropolitan areas. This challenge also aligns with other actions identified by the Federal Interagency Reentry Council, a Cabinet-level working group to support the Federal Government’s efforts to promote public safety and economic opportunity through purposeful cross-agency coordination and collaboration.    The Aspire Challenge will serve as a catalyst to leverage business formation as a tool for economic mobility and self-employment for the formerly incarcerated through the design and delivery of intensive entrepreneurial education and increased access to microloans. This competition is designed to award prizes to entrepreneurial support organizations that propose innovative and sustainable solutions to equipping the formerly-incarcerated with the education and technical assistance they need to start and grow a business.</p>
