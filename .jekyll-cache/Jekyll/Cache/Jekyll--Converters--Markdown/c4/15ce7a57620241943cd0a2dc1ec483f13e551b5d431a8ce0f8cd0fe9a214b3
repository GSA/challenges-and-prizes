I"ß<p><strong>Overall Prize</strong> shall be awarded to the top system of knee and elbow pads as determined by the panel based on the review of submissions against the Prize Challenge requirements above.</p>
<p>First place (full prize) will receive $4,000.&nbsp; In order to receive the full prize, a candidate must submit both knee and elbow pads for consideration and both pads must be selected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Candidates that submit only one portion of the system, will receive only half of the prize award.&nbsp; (i.e., candidate &ldquo;A&rdquo; submits only knee pads and if chosen as the overall prize winner, candidate &ldquo;A&rdquo; will only receive $2,000 vice the full amount of $4,000).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Candidates who submit both knee and elbow pads and only have one component selected will only receive $2,000.</p>
<p>An <strong>Innovation Prize</strong> of $1,000 shall be awarded to whichever design is determined to demonstrate the most innovative concept that introduces new or innovative materials over current systems.&nbsp; Product improvements or engineering change proposals on existing knee and elbow pads will not satisfy the requirements of this Prize Challenge and therefore an innovation prize will not be awarded.&nbsp;</p>
