I"&<p><strong>Judging Panel</strong></p>

<p>Submissions that comply with the challenge requirements will be reviewed by a panel of judges consisting of Government Representatives. Entries will be scored by a panel of judges with a resident knowledge of the Technology Challenge topic.  One Judging Panel will be assigned per Challenge Topic and will judge only the topic in which they are assigned.</p>

<p><strong>Judging Criteria</strong></p>

<p>Each submission will be judged based on the following criteria with each judge panel independently scoring the solution on a scale of 1-5 and then calculated into a weighted percentage as detailed below. A score of “1” indicates that the submission received the lowest consideration based on the scoring criteria below whereas a score of “5” would indicate that the submission is considered the highest of interest to the Government. The winner will be determined by averaging all judges’ scores and calculating the highest scoring solution.</p>
