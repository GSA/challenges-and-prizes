<p>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), the Seeker for this Challenge, plays a significant role in managing the Colorado River. Reclamation relies on a broad range of Colorado River Basin (CRB) data to support short-term water management and long-term planning, including data on historical, current, and projected weather and climate conditions, reservoir storage and releases, streamflows, and diversions.</p>
<p>Reclamation is currently working to make CRB data more easily accessible to both Reclamation staff and non-Reclamation users such as other Federal, State, and local agencies, water users, recreationists, researchers, and other stakeholders As Reclamation works to improve data access, better approaches to visualizing CRB data are needed to improve data exploration, analysis, interpretation, and communication by Reclamation and non-Reclamation users. In particular, better visualization approaches are needed to improve understanding and communication of current and projected conditions in the basin and the water management actions that affect those conditions. Reclamation and its Collaborators seek innovative, interactive, and user-driven visualizations to improve understanding of past, present, and projected conditions in the CRB and to support analysis and decision making by Reclamation and non-Reclamation users.</p>
