I"™E<p><u>1. Subject of Challenge Competition</u>: Given the success and growing popularity of the National Science Foundation‚Äôs I-Corps‚Ñ¢ program (see http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/about.jsp), the SBA is interested in the potential for using adapted versions of that program as a means to assist a broader array of small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs operating outside the I-Corps‚Ñ¢ program‚Äôs current focus on technology-based businesses or commercialization concepts. For reference, the I-Corps‚Ñ¢ program involves expert business trainers helping teams of scientists and entrepreneurs apply ‚Äúlean principles‚Äù‚Äîa collection of practices and concepts for business model analysis‚Äîto those scientists‚Äô and entrepreneurs‚Äô nascent entrepreneurial efforts.¬† Given the SBA‚Äôs esteem for the success of this program, the SBA has partnered with the National Science Foundation (NSF) to offer the Lean for Main Street Training Challenge to current SBA Women‚Äôs Business Centers, Small Business Development Centers, and SCORE Chapters (‚ÄúContestants‚Äù). Contestants selected as winners will participate in the development and deployment of innovative ‚Äúlean startup‚Äù resources that can be delivered to small businesses in sectors or regions that have not had significant exposure or access to these resources. Winning Contestant representatives will participate in an in-person and virtual train-the-trainer¬† program and forum with I-Corps‚Ñ¢ national instructors to develop an innovative framework for exposing lean methodology to businesses in traditional sectors.¬† Winners will then implement these newly-developed lean training resources to businesses in their respective communities on a pilot basis and provide SBA with an assessment of their effectiveness.</p>

Amount of Prize&lt;/u&gt;: Through the Lean for Main Street Training Challenge, the SBA will award up to five cash prizes of $25,000 each.¬† Additionally, scholarships with a value of up to $1,200 each will be issued by the SBA for two representatives of each winning organization to attend a 7 week ¬†I-Corps‚Ñ¢ ¬†in person and virtual train the trainer program.¬† The in person component of the training will take place in Washington, DC March 29 through April 1, 2016 and again May 11 through 14; virtual sessions will take place on April 7, 14, 21, 28, and May 5.¬† On May 14, winners will participate in a forum with I-Corps instructors to discuss and refine their customized lean programs which will then be piloted by the winners.    &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;5. Payment of Prize&lt;/u&gt;: ¬†The scholarships portion of the prize will be disbursed in the form of two vouchers for the two representatives from each winning organization to attend the I-Corps‚Ñ¢ training event in early 2016.¬† The cash prize portion of the award will be disbursed in a series of three payments. The first payment, equal to 60 percent of a winner‚Äôs total prize amount, will be disbursed upon award once all initial requirements have been met. The second payment, equal to 20 percent of a winner's total prize amount, will be disbursed after a winner has presented a modified I-Corps‚Ñ¢ program to the SBA and Agency staff has deemed that solution satisfactory. This solution must be presented within six (6) months of the date of the award unless otherwise specified by the SBA. The remaining 20 percent of the total prize amount will be disbursed after a winner submits a written assessment that includes, but is not limited to, the outcomes and outputs of the pilot implementation as measured by the metrics outlined in its proposal, a summary of any lessons learned and best practices, and suggestions for any improvements to the design or implementation of similar competitions in the future. The written assessment must be submitted to SBA no later than 12 months after a winner receives its first prize payment.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;6. Selection of Winners&lt;/u&gt;: ¬†Winners will be selected based upon how well they address the following criteria on their application forms:  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Audience: SBA‚Äôs Resource Partners interact with a diverse group of small business owners and entrepreneurs. While lean materials aimed towards tech startups are commonly available, entrepreneurs in different industries, with different backgrounds, or from different geographies may find these materials less applicable to their immediate circumstances. In order to be successful, a Contestant should clearly identify the specific audience for which their solution would be developed. Contestants are free to define their audience according to their own parameters (e.g. Sector, Business Phase (pre-venture, startup, existing businesses) Geography, Historically Disadvantaged or Underserved Status , etc.)&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Adaptation: To kick off the adaptation of the I-Corps program, each winner will send two representatives to NSF‚Äôs I-Corps gathering in Washington, DC, where they will work in dedicated groups with I-Corps instructors as part of a specialized Train the Trainer program. Applications should outline exactly how representatives intend to benefit from this experience, including any specific knowledge gaps that representatives are looking to fill through their participation. They should also give a clear idea of the demonstrated ability of each representative to adapt and deliver new resources to small businesses. Please note that while SBA is interested in your knowledge and experience with lean methods, preexisting expertise in lean methodology is NOT a requirement for this Competition.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Implementation: An entrepreneurial development program is only as good as the people it can reach. While the ability to adapt and customize entrepreneurial development resources is clearly important, equally important will be the Contestants‚Äô solution to delivering their curriculum to small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs in their target audience. An application should delineate, as clearly as possible, how the Resource Partner intends to leverage their existing relationships, the curriculum that they will develop, and the funds awarded to bring lean methods into their communities on a pilot basis. Applications should also give a clear idea of how they intend to assess¬†the effectiveness of their program, including specific metrics that the Resource Partner will track.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;7. Applicable Law&lt;/u&gt;: ¬†This Competition is being conducted by SBA pursuant to the America Competes Act (15 U.S.C. 3719) and is subject to all applicable federal laws and regulations.
