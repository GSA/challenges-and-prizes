<p>Each team will initially be provided with a dataset consisting of recorded camera imagery of vessel traffic along with the recorded GPS track of a vessel of interest that is seen in the imagery.  Submitted solutions will be evaluated against additional camera data correlated to recorded vessel tracks that are not included in the competition testing set in order to verify generalization of the solutions.  The same vessel and the same instrumentation will be used in both the competition data set and the judging data set.</p>

<p>Submitted software entries will be executed on a Nvidia Jetson TX2 running the Ubuntu 18.04 operating system and preconfigured with Robot Operating System (ROS) software.  This system will have no access to the internet and will be set up solely for this challenge.</p>

<p>Specific questions about software availability, version, or compatibility concerns should be directed to the challenge managers during the course of the challenge and should be fully resolved before final submission of an entry.</p>

<h4 id="judging-criteria">Judging Criteria</h4>

<p>Track Accuracy</p>

<ul>
  <li>This will calculate the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the ground truth tracks and the submitterâ€™s</li>
  <li>It will have a weight of 70% towards the final score</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall Processing Time</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is the time from when your software starts until your software ends and a list of waypoints is generated</li>
  <li>It will have a weight of 30% towards the final score</li>
</ul>
