I"_<p>The EV Everywhere Logo Design Challenge invites designers to create a compelling graphic that communicates two main ideas:<br /> 1) that plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are beneficial and practical and <br />2) EV Everywhere is the place for drivers to come for data-driven, objective information about them. As PEVs can help increase America’s economic, energy, and environmental security, the Department of Energy and its stakeholders will be leading the way through EV Everywhere.</p>
<p>The competition is only the first part of an expanded outreach and education effort to increase consumer awareness of PEVs’ benefits. The winning logo will be featured in EV Everywhere communications products, potentially including a magnetic decal, the program’s website and any other official Department of Energy purpose.</p>
<p>The winner has been selected for the EV Everywhere Logo Design Challenge: Brian Marquis. The winning logo is below.  For more information, see the <a href="http://energy.gov/eere/articles/new-ev-everywhere-logo-ready-road">Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy's blog post</a> on the winning entry. <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/EV-Everywhere-logo-final-design.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-91801 size-medium" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/EV-Everywhere-logo-final-design-300x232.jpg" alt="Winner of the EV Everywhere logo contest.
