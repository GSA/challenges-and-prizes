<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The SBA has made the following rule changes for the Aspire Challenge: </span>  &lt;ul type="disc"&gt;    &lt;li class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;<span style="color: #ff0000;">Section (1)(iii) “Needs Assessment” - The challenge rules previously requested a “data driven needs assessment” submitted by applicants. In lieu of this requirement, the SBA requests a “brief needs assessment” in your application. The needs assessment may be included as a narrative within the “organizational background” component as related to the applicant’s geographic service area. </span>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;<span style="color: #ff0000;">Section (5) “Written Assessment Requirements” - The challenge rules previously requested applicant organizations to identify metrics and outcomes to measure the success of service delivery under the Aspire Challenge. This requirement has been removed. Instead, the SBA intends to develop metrics for success measurement collaboratively with the Aspire Challenge network as a whole post-award. </span>&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  <span style="color: #ff0000;">This update is intended only to highlight changes to the text featured in the Aspire Challenge Competition Details. </span>  &lt;p align="center"&gt;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>* END UPDATE: RULES CHANGES</strong>*</span>&lt;/p&gt;  <u>Competition Details</u>:    (1)  <u>Subject of Challenge Competition</u>:  The SBA is working to create pathways towards entrepreneurship and access to capital resources to individuals who have been formerly incarcerated.  The SBA is looking for contestants who offer solutions that are innovative and relevant based on the needs of this target market.  Solutions should incorporate the following two components:  &lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;(i) <u>Delivery of Intensive Entrepreneurial Education</u> to individuals who have been formerly incarcerated, by providing innovative and comprehensive entrepreneurial education with a focus on the following:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="padding-left: 60px;"&gt;(A) Develop and deliver comprehensive entrepreneurship training, for which individuals who have been incarcerated will earn a certificate upon completion;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="padding-left: 60px;"&gt;(B) Provide individualized business mentoring to support participants’ growth as prospective entrepreneurs;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="padding-left: 60px;"&gt;(C) Build participants’ ties to the larger business community; and&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="padding-left: 60px;"&gt;(D) Connect participants to opportunities for life skills development and financial literacy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;(ii) <u>Access to Capital</u>:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;When appropriate, link participants with participating micro-lenders including SBA Microloan Intermediaries, to fund new businesses and provide capital to existing ventures.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;(iii) Aspire Challenge contestants shall provide a brief needs assessment of the proposed community’s entrepreneurial ecosystem as it exists today and identify training, education and support gaps for individuals who have been formerly incarcerated.
