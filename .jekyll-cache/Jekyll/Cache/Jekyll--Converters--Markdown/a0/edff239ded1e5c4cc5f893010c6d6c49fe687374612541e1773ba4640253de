<p><strong>Stage II, Concepts</strong></p>
<p>To be eligible to win a prize under this stage, an individual or entity must submit:</p>
<p>1.<strong> A written summary of the proof of concept with a detailed system design and text that addresses each Stage II judging criterion in detail.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Semi-finalists must provide a written summary of the proof of concept, refining and adding additional detail to their initial ideation (20 page maximum).&nbsp; The summary must describe its plans for data use, technical approach, user implementation, testing and deployment, and tool development in a high level of technical detail and address the Solution Requirements and Judging Criteria for this stage.</p>
<p>2.<strong> Information on the qualifications of the team who would be responsible for developing the idea into a proof of concept and prototype.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Applicants must include a resume or bio of key individual(s) who would be responsible for developing the idea into a proof of concept with a detailed system design and prototype.&nbsp;If applicants plan to work with an Innovation Agent, this section should indicate which Innovation Agent(s) the applicant will be working with and their role in tool development.</p>
<p>3.<strong> A prototype with a working interactive model of the analytical visualization tool, that can be easily accessed by DOT judges.</strong></p>
<p>The prototype must provide an idea of the proposed design, navigation and layout of the tool. It must demonstrate the functionality and verify that the analytical visualization or simulation tool idea and concept can be achieved in full development.<br /><br />The prototype should demonstrate what the tool looks like and how it operates from the target user&rsquo;s perspective. It should demonstrate, for example:</p>
<ul> <li>How a user would access and input data from different sources;</li> <li>What types of analyses could be performed on the data;</li> <li>What different types of visualizations/reports/charts/GIS maps could be generated from the analyses, what these outputs would look like, whether they would be dynamic or static, and to what extent they could be customized according to a user&rsquo;s needs; and</li> <li>How a user would navigate from one screen and one functionality to another.</li> <li>The prototype should tell the story of how the target audience would use the tool to create actionable insights on safety.</li> </ul>
<p>It will be the responsibility of the competitor to furnish the necessary access for DOT judges to view and interact with the prototype. DOT will not install or deploy the prototype on its own equipment or cloud services, so competitors must plan to provision access.</p>
<p>4.<strong> A video providing a high-level overview of the proof of concept with strong examples of visualizations.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Applicants must prepare a short video (5-minute maximum).&nbsp;The video should provide a high-level overview of the proof of concept with strong examples of visualizations.&nbsp; It should include a discussion of the objectives of the tool, the target audience(s), what safety problem the tool is attempting to solve, how the tool functions, and how it can be used to address the safety problem. The video should also highlight the novelty of the tool, how it differs from existing tools.</p>
<p>5.<strong> Virtual demonstration of the prototype.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The applicant must be prepared to conduct a virtual demonstration of the prototype for the technical evaluation judging team.&nbsp; The presentation and demonstration should be no more than 10 minutes.&nbsp;An additional 20 minutes will be allotted for questions from the judging team.</p>
