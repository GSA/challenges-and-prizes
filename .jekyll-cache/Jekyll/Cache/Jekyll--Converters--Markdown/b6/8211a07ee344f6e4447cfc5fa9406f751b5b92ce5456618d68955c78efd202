Background:    The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (Pub. L. 114â€‘10, enacted April 16, 2015) (MACRA) requires the Secretary to establish a new Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) program, which will assist the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) in accelerating the transition from the traditional fee-for-service payment model to a system that rewards health care providers for value rather than volume of services provided. The MIPS program combines parts of the Physician Quality Reporting System, the Value Modifier (VM or Value-based Payment Modifier), and the Medicare Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program into one single program that assesses the performance of MIPS eligible clinicians based on four performance categories: (1) Quality, (2) Resource use, (3) Clinical practice improvement activities, and (4) Meaningful use of certified EHR technology. This program has the potential of impacting 1.2 million MIPS clinicians.    One of the most important aspects and challenges of our program is educating and providing outreach to the potential 1.2 million MIPS clinicians. Feedback we have received from our customers/end users is that they want more real-time information and access to assistance so they can successfully report to our programs. Therefore, we are launching a MIPS mobile challenge to find innovative ways of improving communication to educate physicians, support staff, health organization leadership, data vendors, and others impacted parties. Due to the multiple user types and facets of the MIPS program we are looking at utilizing a mobile platform, which could be a mobile site or application to determine how to best keep our customers/end users informed and meet their specific needs. We also want to provide the capability to access assistance to help MIPS clinicians learn and get help with specific areas. This challenge has the potential to make a significant impact as not only are there 1.2 million MIPS clinicians but also millions of people who support the success of these MIPS clinicians. Having key information and access to the right support at the right time reduces burden and provides increased satisfaction for the MIPS clinicians and their supporting entities.    Phase II will focus on the integration of any features from Phase 1, and user experience testing. During this phase, the participants must submit the object and source code, as well as a detailed description showing that the output meets section 508 compliance per the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (Pub. L. 105-220, enacted August 7, 1998)(WIA) including at least instructions on how to install and operate, and system requirements for running the mobile platform. Participants may submit, as part of the submission, additional software documentation, if they believe it provides a more complete description of the mobile platforms.</p>
