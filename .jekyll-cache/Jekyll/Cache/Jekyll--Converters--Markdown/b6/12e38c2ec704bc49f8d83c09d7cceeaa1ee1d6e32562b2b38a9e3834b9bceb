I"´<p>The In-Situ Materials Challenge seeks solutions to utilize surface-based materials like regolith (crushed basalt rock) for Earth and space fabrication and construction applications and offers a first-place prize of $10,000 and two second-place prizes of $2,500 for top submissions. Advances in technology and methodology can push towards the larger goal of exploration in extraterrestrial environments.    The utilization of native materials is a boon to construction whether Earth based or extraterrestrial. The benefits are dramatic for space exploration because in-situ regolith utilization (ISRU) will reduce the need for materials to be shipped from Earth, which creates additional useful payload mass for habitats, structural systems, life support systems, science equipment, and living provisions. ISRU could potentially save the agency more than $100,000 per kilogram at launch, making space pioneering more affordable and feasible.</p>
