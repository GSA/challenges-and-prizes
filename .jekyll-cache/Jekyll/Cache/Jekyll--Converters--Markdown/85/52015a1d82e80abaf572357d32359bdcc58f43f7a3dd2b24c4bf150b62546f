<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>APPENDIX -Â Profiles of Public Sector Program Managers â€“ ca.</strong><strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;"> 2014</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Program managers in the public sector are a diverse group.Â  They confront an extraordinary range of challenges in mission areas as diverse as regulatory compliance, basic research, service delivery, law enforcement, and military preparedness, to name just a few.Â  While many are unique to a particular program mission, some challenges tend to be shared by all program managers.</span>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<span style="color: #000000;">The following profiles offer a snapshot of the immediate challenges faced by four government program managers.Â  These challenges are defined in part by the tools and resources available to address them.Â  They are defined, as well, by current expectations of what government can and should do.Â  As expectations change, and as technology and workplace skills evolve, the nature of these challenges will change as well.</span>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Profile 1 - regulatory compliance</strong></span>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<span style="color: #000000;">Trina is a program manager with a Federal Government regulatory agency.Â  She leads an office that writes policy, processes industry applications for licenses, and tracks routine industry reporting in support of the agencyâ€™s industry compliance efforts.Â  The office also conducts inspections to ensure industry compliance with laws and policy.Â  In the 20 years that Trina has spent with the Government, the work of her office has been transformed by historic advances in online and data processing technologies.Â  Although the agencyâ€™s compliance efforts are more effective than at any point in the past, Trina recognizes the need to develop more sophisticated approaches to keep up with a rapidly evolving industry and an increasingly complicated regulatory environment.</span>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Profile 2 - service delivery</strong></span>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<span style="color: #000000;">Henry manages a program that benefits low income households.Â  Removing barriers to participation by eligible households is central to the programâ€™s purpose.Â  At the same time the program is committed to eliminating payments to ineligible recipients. Henry believes that facilitating access to benefits and strengthening program integrity need not compete against each other; greater understanding of the factors that lead to improper certification for program benefits might be useful in developing strategies to reach the unserved eligible population.Â  Henry has challenged his staff and program partners to draw on their diversity of skills and perspectives to come up with ideas that advance both goals simultaneously so that 25 years from now the present tension between the two is replaced with a relationship of positive and mutual reinforcement.Â  Welcome to the team!</span>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Profile 3 - grants management</strong></span>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<span style="color: #000000;">Ty oversees an office that awards and administers grants to community-based social service organizations.Â  As part of an ongoing effort to maximize the agencyâ€™s return on investment, Tyâ€™s office is awarding more grants to organizations that promise innovative approaches to service delivery.Â  Many of those organizations are first-time recipients of government grants.Â  Although Ty and his staff are encouraged by early signs of success, they recognize the need for careful oversight and evaluation.Â  They also recognize that new models of service delivery may call for changes in the way that the office collects and analyzes program data.Â  Responding to these challenges is critical to ensuring that management of the grant-making process does not stand in the way of grantee-led program innovation.</span>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Profile 4 - law enforcement</strong></span>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<span style="color: #000000;">Sami was recently hired by her cityâ€™s chief of police to review the organizationâ€™s case prioritization approach. Â She is faced with the dilemma of meeting higher expectations for successful criminal prosecution/crime reduction/agility in response to emerging threats without any increase in enforcement and civilian staff. Â She is expected to do so in a more transparent manner and to further complicate things, the budget is shrinking. Â Sami is reaching out to other law enforcement agencies to learn what they are doing that she may be able to replicate but she also believes that new, innovative approaches are necessary to meet expectations in the long run. Â She is actually more concerned about internal resistance to trying new approaches than she is about anything else.</span>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
