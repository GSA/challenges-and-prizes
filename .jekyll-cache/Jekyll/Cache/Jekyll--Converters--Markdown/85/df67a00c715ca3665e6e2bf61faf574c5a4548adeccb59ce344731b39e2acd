<p><strong>Guidance on video content and format</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Video requirements</u></strong></p>
<ul> <li><strong>The following are video requirements that must be met for videos to be considered eligible for this competition. Videos&nbsp;must:</strong></li> <ul> <li><strong>Target at least one </strong><strong><a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/director/2018/11/counting_everyoneon.html">hard-to-count</a></strong><strong> population,&nbsp;</strong>such as (but not limited to):&nbsp;racial and ethnic minorities, non-native English speakers, millennials/gen Z, families with young children, (please see page 2 of the&nbsp;<u><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/document-library/2020-Census-Resource-Guide-GOTC-Video-Prize-Challenge-UPDATED.pdf">Resource Guide</a></u>&nbsp;for a comprehensive list).</li> <li>Be at <strong>least 30 seconds and no more than 3 minutes</strong> in length</li> <li>Be digital and available online via a web link. Ideally, videos should be designed for or available on platforms such as YouTube.</li> <li><strong>Contain only accurate and factual content about the census.</strong>&nbsp;A&nbsp;<u><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/document-library/2020-Census-Resource-Guide-GOTC-Video-Prize-Challenge-UPDATED.pdf">resource guide</a></u>&nbsp;is available as content guidance, as well as all resources on <a href="https://2020census.gov/">2020census.gov</a>. Questions or clarifications on census facts may be directed to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:census.accelerate@census.gov">census.accelerate@census.gov</a>; clarifying questions are encouraged and will not impact eligibility or chances of winning a prize<em>.</em></li> </ul> </ul>
<p><strong><u>Video messaging guidance</u></strong></p>
<ul> <li><strong>All videos&nbsp;<em>are strongly encouraged to</em>:</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Contain a balance of emotional storytelling and clear, relevant, motivating information.</strong></li> <li><strong>Speak to the tangible benefits of the census</strong>. For example, the census means funding for your community for critical services like hospitals, health care, education, roads,&nbsp;<u><a href="https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/361">SNAP</a></u>, and more. (See the&nbsp;<u><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/document-library/2020-Census-Resource-Guide-GOTC-Video-Prize-Challenge-UPDATED.pdf">&ldquo;key facts</a></u>&rdquo; section of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/document-library/2020-Census-Resource-Guide-GOTC-Video-Prize-Challenge-UPDATED.pdf">Resource Guide</a> and <a href="https://2020census.gov/">2020census.gov</a> to learn more about the benefits.) It also determines how many representatives your state will have in the House of Representatives; these are the people who will vote on issues that deeply impact your life and community.</li> <li><strong>Focus on multiple benefits of completing the census&nbsp;</strong>where format allows.</li> <li><strong>Weave direct messaging into realistic, authentic situations that avoid stereotyping</strong>in order to clearly communicate the importance and relevance of census participation.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>General messaging guidance:</strong> <ul> <li>Messaging that links 2020 Census participation to a better future for kids is broadly motivating.</li> <li>In messaging research, &ldquo;funding for your community&rdquo; tested more strongly than &ldquo;political representation&rdquo; as a motivating factor.</li> <li>Participants enjoy wit and tasteful humor, upbeat tempo, and inclusive imagery.</li> <li>It is important to convey the message that the census is safe.</li> <li>Consider the metaphor of &ldquo;disappearing&rdquo; &mdash; leaving valuable benefits on the table for you and your community, and communicating that the census impacts the next 10 years of your life.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Additional messaging guidance for specific audiences:</strong> <ul> <li>Consider using languages other than English (there are&nbsp;<u><a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/planning-management/language-resources/language-guides.html">59 language guides available</a></u>; the census itself is available in 13 languages).</li> <li>In messaging research, young people connected with diversity and inclusion and demonstrated a deep understanding of the key messages and effects of the census.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Strike the right tone in light of current global events:</strong> <ul> <li>As families and individuals across the U.S. settle into a new reality, people are searching for ways to connect with their communities from their living rooms. Parents and caregivers are looking for something to teach or do with their children, businesses are trying to stay afloat, and local governments are trying to keep their communities safe and informed. Despite the current situation, it&rsquo;s important to remember that future funding for many of the critical healthcare and emergency services being used today will be determined by communities participating in the 2020 Census.</li> <li><strong>Key message to incorporate into videos:&nbsp; </strong> <ul> <li><strong>It has never been easier to respond on your own, either online, by phone, or by mail, without having to meet a census taker. </strong></li> <li><strong>Responding now will minimize the need for the Census Bureau to send census takers out into communities to follow up. </strong></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<p><em>Please <u><a href="https://2020census.gov/en/news-events/press-kits/covid-19.html">check this page</a></u> for regular updates.</em></p>
<ul> <li><strong>Additional timing considerations of the challenge, which will conclude in the &ldquo;reminder phase&rdquo;:</strong>When winners of this challenge are announced<strong>&nbsp;in May</strong>, the national census advertising campaign will be in the &ldquo;reminder&rdquo; phase. <ul> <li>The key message during this phase is that although the census will have kicked off in March,&nbsp;<strong>it&rsquo;s not too late to respond.</strong></li> <li>Effective messages specific to the reminder phase include:&nbsp; <ul> <li><strong>Convey urgency</strong>:&nbsp; it is important to fill out the census right away.</li> <li>You can still respond online today before you get a knock on the door by a census-taker (officially called an &ldquo;enumerator&rdquo;).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>
