<p>A full description of registration, rules, submissions, and evaluations are at: <a href="http://iab-rubric.org/DFW/dfw.html">http://iab-rubric.org/DFW/dfw.html</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Protocol</strong></p>

<p>The DFW dataset consists of 1000 subject and total of 11155 images. Out of this dataset, 400 subjects comprise the training set and 600 subjects comprise the testing set. The subject folder consists of a subject, disguised, and impersonator images.   Access to the DFW dataset is granted to participants after enrollment through the DFW website.</p>

<p><strong>Submission</strong></p>
<ol>
 	<li>Participants' are required to generate similarity scores (a larger value indicates greater similarity) from the biometric matchers. If a participant's matcher generates a dissimilarity score instead of a similarity score, the scores should be negated or inverted in some way so that the resulting value is a similarity measure. Participants in the competition have been provided with the testing set. From the data, the participants are required to generate and submit similarity matrices of size 7771 X 7771, the size of the testing data. The ordering of test images is same in both row and column. The (i,j) entry of a similarity matrix is the similarity score generated by the algorithm when supplied an image i from the testing set and query entry j as a probe sample. Entry (i,i) as it corresponds to matching the same image.</li>
 	<li>Participants are also required to submit the score matrix on the training database. The ordering should be exactly same as the order given in the text file containing subject names.</li>
 	<li>Participants are required to submit the matrices along with the companion data for the corresponding 1,000 points ROC curves. The match scores computed with validation and disguised images will comprise the genuine scores. Impostor scores will include match scores generated from impersonator images as well as cross subject matching scores.</li>
 	<li>While it is not mandatory, we also encourage the participants to submit their models/executable/API for verification of the results.</li>
 	<li>The participants can choose to remain anonymous in the analysis and report. Participants must explicitly make this request; the default position will be to associate results with participants.</li>
