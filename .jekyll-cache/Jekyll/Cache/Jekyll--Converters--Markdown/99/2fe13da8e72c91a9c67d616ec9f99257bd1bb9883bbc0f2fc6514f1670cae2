<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Problem Statement</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Traditional approaches in health services research rely on rigorous methods, the availability of recent data, and peer review to assure the highest quality of analyses. However, some decision-makers must make policy decisions quickly with the current information available and cannot wait until new analyses are complete. Predictive analytics and related methods may offer a solution to balance the need for rapid information and academic rigor. While predictive analytics and related methods have been used successfully in many fields, their use to understand how healthcare is delivered is largely unexplored.</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Challenge Goal</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The purpose of the Predicting Health Care Utilization Challenge is to explore how predictive analytics and related methods may be applied and contribute to understanding healthcare issues, AHRQ invites applicants to use predictive analytics and related methods to estimate hospital inpatient utilization for: (1) the U.S. overall, (2) the four U.S. Census Regions, and (3) selected medical conditions. Building on AHRQ&rsquo;s current data infrastructure, AHRQ will provide approved applicants customized analytic files that includes hospital inpatient discharge data for several years.</span></p></div>
