I"Æ<p>The Department of Education is offering a total prize pot of up to $50,000. The entirety of the prize may go to one winner or may be split between multiple winners, if the panel determines multiple winners are warranted. Up to three prize winners may be selected from the submissions, including a Grand Prize, a Runner Up, and an Honorable Mention.</p>

<p>At the Departmentâ€™s discretion, to assist with selecting winners, one or more of the most highly rated challenge participants may be invited to present a live demonstration of their ED.gov redesign prototype before agency subject matter experts, including Office of the Chief Information Officer staff, website owners, or segment owners.</p>

<p>Any potential prizes awarded under this Challenge will be paid by electronic funds transfer.  Winners will be required to complete and return an Automated Clearing House (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment Enrollment Form to ED within a given timeframe. The form collects banking information needed to make an electronic payment (direct deposit) to the winner. Award recipients will be responsible for any applicable local, state, and federal taxes and reporting that may be required under applicable tax laws.</p>
