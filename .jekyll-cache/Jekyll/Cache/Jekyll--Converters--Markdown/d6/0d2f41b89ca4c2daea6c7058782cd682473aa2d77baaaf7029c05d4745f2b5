I"Ç<p><strong>JUDGING AND USE CASES:</strong>  This Challenge is in two stages. Below are the judging criteria and ‚ÄúUse Cases‚Äù that provide context for Challenge and awarding of cash prizes.</p>

<p>Submissions should explain how well the proposed solution(s) address the cooling problem and use cases based on the criteria below for both Stage 1 and Stage 2. Overall, the judging will consider how user-friendly (easy-to-install or retro-fit and easy-to-use) and cost effective the solution is, and how well it meets the judging criteria.</p>

<p>Stage 1 Finalists will be based on how well the proposed solution(s) addresses the cooling problem and Use Cases including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How well does the submission address the problem and criteria?  This can include evaluation and demonstration of the solution and applicability to use case(s).</li>
  <li>How unique is solution?  What is the value proposition, how has the technology been used and validated, and are there potential benefits or tradeoffs?</li>
  <li>What is the business model or financial plans?</li>
</ul>

<p>Stage 2 will be judged on the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All the criteria indicated in Stage 1</li>
  <li>Cooling capacity ‚Äì The solution must achieve a cooling temperature within 10% variance of difference between the dry and wet bulb temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (for both indoor and outdoor scenarios). Ability to sustain the reduced temperature for 95% of the time that the temperature remains at 35 degrees Celsius during a 6-hour test scenario.</li>
  <li>Energy usage ‚Äì Demonstrate 35-50% reduction in energy consumption compared to a traditional Air Conditioning (A/C) cooling baseline unit.</li>
  <li>Water consumption ‚Äì Demonstrate 25-50% reduced water consumption compared to a traditional A/C cooling baseline unit, as applicable.</li>
  <li>Emissions ‚Äì Produces zero greenhouse emissions during use.</li>
  <li>Refrigerant ‚Äì Does not contain ozone depleting cooling agents or hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).</li>
  <li>Ease of Operation ‚Äì Does not require a designed-in engineering solution; easily portable for reuse in a variety of environments; does not require specialized training; minimum operating instructions; plug-and-play; deployable within 10-minutes or less; ability to operate using a backup power source; no special storage requirements.</li>
  <li>Affordability ‚Äì Cost must not exceed 2x the cost of a comparable, traditional A/C cooling baseline unit.</li>
  <li>No FDA compliance / medical technologies.</li>
  <li>Applicability to Use Case(s).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Submissions should indicate and address at least one of the Use Cases:</p>

<p><em>Use Case 1: Assisting First Responders</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Applicable to both first responder personal use and using on survivors at risk of heat-related stress.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Use Case 2: Personal Use</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Applicable to individual use in indoor/outdoor environments.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Use Case 3: Household, group quarter or multi-person use as an alternative to conventional Air Conditioning or built-in cooling solutions:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Many currently available home-cooling technologies consume large amounts of power.  That energy use makes these technologies not only expensive but also unavailable during a sustained power outage.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Use Case 4: Indoor/outdoor venues accessible to homeless or displaced populations in public settings</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>For example, public cooling areas on streets, in schools, stadiums, subway and bus stations, or other solutions for individuals that do not have access to cooling.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Judging Panel:</strong></p>

<p>A judging panel will consist of DHS, and other Federal partner representatives.  The judging panel could include State and local, and non-governmental emergency response partners related to preparedness or response mission areas.</p>
