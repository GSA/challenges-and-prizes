<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) located within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announces the launch of the Healthy Behavior Data Challenge.</p>
<p>The Healthy Behavior Data Challenge responds to the call for new ways to address the challenges and limitations of self-reported health surveillance information and tap into the potential of innovative data sources and alternative methodologies for public health surveillance.</p>
<p>The Healthy Behavior Data (HBD) Challenge will support the development and implementation of prototypes to use these novel methodologies and data sources (e.g., wearable devices, mobile applications, and/or social media) to enhance traditional healthy behaviors surveillance systems in the areas of nutrition, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and/or sleep among the adult population aged 18 years and older in the US and US territories.</p>
<p>The collection of health data through traditional surveillance modes including telephone and in-person interviewing, however, is becoming increasingly challenging and costly with declines in participation and changes in personal communications. In addition, the self-reported nature of responses particularly in the areas of nutrition, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and sleep has been a major limitation in these surveillance systems, since self-reported data are subject to under/over reporting and recall bias. Meanwhile, the advent of new technologies and data sources including wearable devices ( such as:&nbsp; smart watches, activity trackers, sleep monitors, etc.), mobile health applications on smartphones or tablets, and data from social media represents an opportunity to enhance the ability to monitor health-related information and potentially adjust for methodological limitations in traditional self-reported data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Healthy Behavior Data (HBD) Challenge will be conducted concurrently with a similar challenge proposed by the Public Health Agency of Canada.&nbsp; This will enable the two countries to learn from their respective challenges and leverage information.&nbsp; We expect increased efficiency with a dual challenge.</p>
<p>The Healthy Behavior Data Challenge participants will propose data sources and approaches for aggregating data from wearable devices, mobile applications and/or social media in the areas of nutrition, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and/or sleep. In Phase II (Prototype Implementation), a subset of submissions (up to 3) with promising concepts will be invited to test their proposed approaches for ongoing public health surveillance.</p>
