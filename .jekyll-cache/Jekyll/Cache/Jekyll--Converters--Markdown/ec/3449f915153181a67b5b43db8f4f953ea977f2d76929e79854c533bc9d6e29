I")<h3>Stages</h3>
<p>This Challenge consists of two stages:</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1</strong> is a Theoretical Challenge requiring submission of a white paper. Within the white paper, participants are asked to submit an idea along with detailed descriptions, drawings, illustrations, specifications, supporting data or literature, and any other things that would be needed to bring the idea to practice. Stage 1 may award up to five prizes from a total prize award pool of $75,000.</p>
<p><strong>If Stage 1 produces winning concepts and Reclamation determines Stage 2 competition is beneficial, Reclamation will launch</strong> a subsequent Reduction-to-Practice (RTP) Challenge. Participants will be asked to present their technology and submit a working prototype that puts their idea into practice. Stage 2 is anticipated to have a larger prize purse than Stage 1. In addition to the direct monetary award for Stage 2, Reclamation will invite industry, non-profit organizations, and venture capital representatives to the Stage 2 presentations and testing.&nbsp; Participating industry, non-profit organization, and venture capital representatives will have the ability to seek and secure potential business deals with Solvers.&nbsp; Reclamation will invite and encourage Stage 1 winning solvers to participate, but will also open Stage 2 to the public for new submissions.</p>
<p>This posting only launches the Stage 1 competition. If Stage 2 is implemented, it will be officially launched and announced with a separate Challenge.gov posting.</p>
<p>Stage 1 is a Theoretical Challenge that requires only a written proposal to be submitted. The Seeker (Reclamation) has a total cash prize purse budget of $75,000 for Stage 1.&nbsp; The minimum full award amount is $15,000. The Seeker can allocate higher individual award amounts up to the prize purse of $75,000, as it deems appropriate. The Challenge award will be contingent upon results of critical analysis and evaluation by the Seeker and the judging panel appointed by the Seeker.&nbsp; A total of up to five awards can be made for the highest ranked submissions that meet or exceed the Solution Requirements.&nbsp; Meeting the Solution Requirements does not guarantee that the proposed solution will receive an award from the Seeker.&nbsp; Partial cash prizes may be considered for solutions that meet some, but not all, of the criteria.</p>
<p>Submissions to this Challenge must be received by 11:59 PM (US Eastern Time) on (1/4/2019). Late submissions will not be considered.</p>
