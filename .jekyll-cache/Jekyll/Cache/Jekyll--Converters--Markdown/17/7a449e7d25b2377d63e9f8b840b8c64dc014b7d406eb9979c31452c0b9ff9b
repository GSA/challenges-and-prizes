I"€<p>In 2014, nearly two million Americans aged 12 or older either abused or were dependent on opioid painkillers, and&nbsp;61% of drug overdose deaths involved either an opioid painkiller or heroin.&nbsp; Naloxone is an antidote for an opioid overdose, whether from prescription opioids or heroin.&nbsp; It is a prescription drug with few side effects that rapidly reverses the effects of opioid overdoses.&nbsp; Although most frequently used in emergency&nbsp;rooms and on ambulances,&nbsp;many states have recently&nbsp;taken steps to make it easier for&nbsp;people in the general public, including family and friends of drug users, to carry and administer naloxone.</p>
<p>Despite&nbsp;the increasing availability of naloxone,&nbsp;people carrying naloxone&nbsp;are often&nbsp;unaware when&nbsp;an overdose occurs nearby.&nbsp; Currently, there are no mechanisms to alert carriers of naloxone to a person in need of the&nbsp;medication.&nbsp; This is where you come in!</p>
<p>FDA is hosting the <strong>2016 FDA Naloxone App Competition</strong> to encourage computer scientists, public health advocates, clinical researchers and entrepreneurs to develop creative solutions to this problem. &nbsp;Specifically, we are looking for innovative ideas for a smartphone app that connects people experiencing an opioid overdose to nearby carriers of naloxone.&nbsp; We are most interested in concepts that are readily scalable, free or low-cost to the end-user, and take advantage of existing systems for naloxone distribution and use.</p>
<p>How does the Competition work?</p>
<ul> <li>You register.&nbsp;See more information about registration below.</li> <li>You decide whether and how you want to participate in one of our first-ever FDA code-a-thons on Oct. 19-20, 2016! There are options for in-person and virtual participation - learn more in the Rules section.</li> <li>You refine your concept after the code-a-thon, and then send in your submission - more details about that below.</li> <li>The submissions are judged, and the entrant with the highest score wins $40,000!</li> </ul>
