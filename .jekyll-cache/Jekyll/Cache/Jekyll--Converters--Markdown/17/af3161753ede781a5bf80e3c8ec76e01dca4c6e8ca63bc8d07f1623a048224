Based on your description, it sounds like the VISTA member service could apply. The nomination narrative would provide more details on the focused effort of the VISTAs, results, etc.    <em>‚ÄìIs there a word limit on the nominations?</em>    Answer: Yes, the nomination narrative should not exceed 500 words.    <em>‚ÄìHow do I submit a nomination?</em>    Answer: Log on to <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">www.challenge.gov</a>, and search for 2016 Excellence in AmeriCorps Programming and Service on the homepage.
