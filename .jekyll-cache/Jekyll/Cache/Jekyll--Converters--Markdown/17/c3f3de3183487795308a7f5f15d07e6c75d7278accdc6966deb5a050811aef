<p><strong>The 2020 Census</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://2020census.gov/">2020 Census</a> is a constitutionally mandated once-a-decade count of our nation.&nbsp;<strong>It is critical that we achieve a complete and accurate count of </strong><strong><a href="https://2020census.gov/en/am-i-required.html">everyone living in the United States</a></strong><strong> because the results determine how many representatives in Congress each state has &mdash; and how more than $675 billion federal dollars are distributed each year into communities for the next decade.</strong>&nbsp;The 2020 Census results inform spending for&nbsp;<strong>critical services like schools, hospitals, roads, fire departments, and much more.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>For further information and talking points about the importance of the 2020 Census, please refer to the&nbsp;<u><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/document-library/2020-Census-Resource-Guide-GOTC-Video-Prize-Challenge-UPDATED.pdf">2020 Census Resources Guide</a></u> and <a href="https://2020census.gov/">2020census.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Many people don&rsquo;t know how important the <a href="https://2020census.gov/">census</a> is to their community and day-to-day lives, and without further explanation or motivation, may not complete it at all. Further, in light of <u><a href="https://2020census.gov/en/news-events/press-kits/covid-19.html">current global events</a></u>, it&rsquo;s important for people to know that<strong> it has never been easier to respond on their own, either online, by phone, or by mail, without having to meet a census taker.</strong></p>
<p>To solve this problem and help promote a complete and accurate count of the population, communities, government, creators, and experts have banded together to create engaging content that explains the importance, use, and safety of the census, and how to complete it.&nbsp; These efforts aim&nbsp;<strong>to make the 2020 Census a must-do for communities, particularly those considered &ldquo;</strong><strong><a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/director/2018/11/counting_everyoneon.html">hard-to-count</a></strong><strong>,&rdquo; such as racial and ethnic minorities, young and mobile populations, families with young children, LGBTQ+, non-English speakers, among others.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>As part of this grassroots outreach effort, it is critical that entertaining and/or humorous content be created in ways that will deeply resonate with a broad audience, with a particular hard-to-count group, or both.</p>
<p><strong><u>Census Accelerate </u></strong></p>
<p>This prize challenge is a component of the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s innovation program called <u><a href="http://accelerate.census.gov">Census Accelerate</a></u>. <strong>&nbsp;Census Accelerate</strong> brings together creative professionals, national advocacy organizations, and local leaders to develop community-driven content about the importance of the 2020 Census.</p>
<p>Its purpose is twofold:</p>
<ul> <li>to amplify trusted voices in hard-to-count communities so that the messages resonate at a deep level, and</li> <li>to fill content voids that can be exploited with disinformation intended to suppress 2020 census response rates.</li> </ul>
<p>Census Accelerate is launching this prize competition to reward 2020 Census-related videos with the highest visibility (or viral potential) and the highest impact (i.e., ability to move people to respond to the census). The challenge focuses on <strong>short-format video content </strong>&mdash; a medium that is relatively lacking in quantity and quality on user-generated platforms such as YouTube. The Census Bureau is conducting this challenge under the authority of and in accordance with the America COMPETES Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. &sect; 3719.</p>
<h2><strong>The challenge:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Explain why the census matters in a short (30 seconds to 3 minutes) video, designed for a platform such as YouTube, that uses entertainment, emotion, creativity, and/or humor to motivate people to respond. </strong></p>
<p>Deadline extended to:&nbsp; 05/07/2020 11:59 PM ET</p>
