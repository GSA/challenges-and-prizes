<p>On February 6, we held a live webinar to discuss the rules and logistics of RAMP 2018.&nbsp; You can find the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nist.gov/video/ramp-2018-challenge-webinar-what-how-and-where-enter">webinar recording here&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018_RAMP_Webinar.pdf">a copy of the slides here</a>.&nbsp; The webinar also demonstrated a prototype tool to support RAMP 2018 called the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/unit-manufacturing-process-ump-builder">UMP Builder</a>, which can be accessed at&nbsp;<a href="https://umpbuilder.nist.gov/">https://umpbuilder.nist.gov/</a>&nbsp; Please use the discussion board if you have any questions.</p>

<p>In the future, manufacturing will be planned out in the virtual world. How can we do this if we don&rsquo;t even have models for the basic processes such as welding, drilling, and forging? Sewing, assembly, or distillation? Nope, we don&rsquo;t even have models for those either! At least, not the types of models really needed for our high-tech world. Manufacturers need models to improve operations, to protect the environment, to share information, and to compose them into systems. Using your models will let manufacturers simulate, improve, and optimize all sorts of processes. Showcase your manufacturing research by entering the RAMP 2018 Challenge!&nbsp; Finalists will be invited to present their entries in a workshop at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asme.org/events/msec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-located ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC) 2018 and the 46th NAMRI/SME North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC)</a> in College Station, TX, on June 18-22.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Theme:</strong> This year's RAMP competition will be underlined by the theme...</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em><span><strong>T</strong><strong>racking Resources and Flows through the System</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Similar to <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ramp-reusable-abstractions-of-manufacturing-processes-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year's competition</a>, the building blocks of each submission are&nbsp;the Unit Manufacturing Process (UMP) models, which represent Reusable Abstractions of Manufacturing Processes (RAMP). Two of the main drivers within this Theme are sustainability and composability. Particular interest will be paid to those submissions that address some element of both drivers. Possible approaches that participants could take to address this year's theme include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>
<ul> <li>Composition of a set of UMP models to conduct material flow analysis (MFA)</li> <li>Waste minimization for part manufacturing (or product assembly) using UMP models</li> <li>Detailed sustainability analysis of a single process using multiple UMP representations</li> <li>Environmental and economic tradeoff analysis using alternative UMP methods</li> <li>Balanced benefits and burden related to sustainability of UMPs</li> </ul>
<p><strong>New to 2018 RAMP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The most significant upgrade to this year's competition is the new <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/UMPSchema_for_user.xsd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UMP Schema</a> that must be followed for submission.&nbsp; &nbsp;The schema is expressed as an <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eXtensible Markup Language (XML) Schema Definition (XSD)</a>.&nbsp; Participants can import the schema into any XML editing tool to help build their XML submissions.&nbsp; Examples of well-formed XML documents built from the schema include an&nbsp;<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Atomic_Layer_Deposition1.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomic Layer Deposition UMP Model</a>&nbsp;and a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GPR_milling_model.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data-Driven Milling UMP Model</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;More information about the schema can be found in the Rules. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-165915 size-full" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/conveyor_orange_boxes_assembly_line_1600_clr_4075.png" alt="" width="457" height="100" /></p>
