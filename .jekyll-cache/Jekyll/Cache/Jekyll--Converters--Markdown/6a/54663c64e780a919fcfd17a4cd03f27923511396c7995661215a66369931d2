<p>EPA is partnering with the U.S. Department of Defenseâ€™s Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) and Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP); the Environmental Council of States (ECOS) and the Environmental Research Institute of the States (ERIS); and Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy; and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, to launch a technical challenge regarding the destruction of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The challenge asks Solvers to submit detailed plans for a non-thermal way of destroying PFAS in concentrated aqueous film forming foam (AFFF), while creating the least amount of potentially harmful byproducts.</p>

<p>PFAS are a group of synthetic chemicals that have been widely used for more than 60 years to make plastics, firefighting foams, and lubricants, and to help make products stain-resistant, waterproof, and nonstick. Addressing and managing PFAS in the environment is one of the most pressing issues facing EPA and its partners. This issue is particularly challenging because PFAS chemicals have a very strong carbon-fluorine chemical bond that leads to persistence in the environment and makes their complete destruction extremely difficult. Given the ubiquitous nature of PFAS and increasing public concerns, EPA and its partners are looking for greater certainty when making decisions about disposal and treatment of PFAS containing materials and PFAS contaminated media/waste.</p>

<p>Although PFAS compounds can be found at different concentrations in various waste streams including aqueous film forming foam (AFFF), biosolids, ground water, sludge and soil, the challenge is focused on unused AFFF. Currently, EPA is investigating all methods of destroying PFAS. Incineration has been used to treat PFAS-contaminated media, and EPA scientists are collaborating with the private sector to evaluate the effectiveness of thermal treatment technologies to completely destroy PFAS. The goal of this challenge is to discover new non-thermal technologies and approaches that remove at least 99 percent of PFAS in unused AFFF while preventing the creation of harmful byproducts.</p>

<h3 id="prizes">Prizes</h3>

<h4 id="total-cash-prize-pool">Total Cash Prize Pool</h4>

<p>The total cash prize pool is $50,000.</p>

<h4 id="prize-breakdown">Prize Breakdown</h4>

<p>EPA may award a total prize award pool of $50,000. The minimum full award amount is $30,000. EPA may allocate higher individual award amounts, as deemed appropriate. The Challenge award will be contingent upon results of critical analysis and evaluation by EPA and its partners. Meeting the Technical Requirements does not guarantee that the proposed solution will receive an award from EPA. Partial cash prizes may be considered for solutions that meet some, but not all, of the criteria.</p>

<p>Winning Solver(s) may be invited to reduce their solution to practice. Solvers should make it clear if they have the interest and ability for subsequent development phases and would be willing to consider future collaborations and/or subsequent competitions with support of government staff and facilities.</p>

  <li>Solvers reserve the right to remove themselves from the competition at any time, up to final submission of results for evaluation, by notifying the sponsor in writing. The technical point of contact must make the request in writing on behalf of his/her team.</li>
  <li>Solvers that do not submit their results and technology description by the submission deadline will be automatically removed from the competition and subject to the same terms as if they had forfeited in writing. The submission deadline may be extended at the discretion of the sponsors, but any extension will apply to all registered Solvers.</li>
  <li>Submissions to this Challenge must be received by 11:59 PM (US Eastern Time) on August 25, 2020. Late submissions will not be considered. Â·</li>
