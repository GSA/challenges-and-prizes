<p><i>Three groups received $300,000 each for innovative solutions to government challenges outlined in the President’s Management Agenda</i></p>
<p>"The GEAR Center challenge is a creative approach that engages the U.S. research and development system to help government adapt and improve in a rapidly changing world,” said GSA Administrator Emily Murphy.  “It also helped form new partnerships between different industries. These impressive winners will bring innovation led by our world class universities and enterprises to influence how the federal government performs."</p>

<div class="description"> <p>The Federal government would benefit from better access to a well-integrated set of partners representing diverse industries and sectors to help resolve our toughest management problems. How can the government improve collaboration with leading private sector organizations, state and local governments, researchers, academic institutions, Federal government representatives, and the public? We cannot keep solving problems the same way and expect different results.</p> <h4><strong>What is the GEAR Center?</strong></h4> <p>As described in the Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century reform plan, <a href="https://www.performance.gov/GEARcenter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Government Effectiveness Advanced Research (GEAR) Center</a> could bring together experts in disciplines ranging from economics, to computer science, to design thinking, in order to take a creative, data-driven, and interdisciplinary approach to new possibilities in how citizens and government interact. The GEAR Center can help government modernize to close the gap between government and private-sector services and capabilities. This may also lay the groundwork for where Federal operations and services need to be in five, 10, or 20 years.</p> <h4><strong>What is the Challenge?</strong></h4> <p>This competition challenges "Solvers" (participating individuals, teams or legal entities) to demonstrate the usefulness of a GEAR Center model by describing how this model would tackle one or more of the major challenges facing government described in the current <a href="https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President's Management Agenda</a> (PMA). For example, how should the government approach the introduction of artificial intelligence into operations? How can agencies more efficiently create a clearing house for matching government needs to relevant project ideas and researchers? Are there new ways to better connect diverse expertise across geographies with Federal agencies who can put that expertise to work in support of their missions? How can Federal agencies better prepare and recruit the Federal workforce?</p> <p>Before the government invests in a future GEAR Center, it is important to first explore the feasibility of creating these types of partnerships and if they can produce the kinds of quality approaches to problem solving the government needs. This competition is designed to reward the top models and execution strategies that will demonstrate a use case of a potential GEAR Center project by building on existing similar efforts.</p> <p>As a first step in formulating the vision for the GEAR Center, in December 2018, the interagency GEAR Team <a href="https://www.performance.gov/GEARcenter/stakeholders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared the results of the Request for Information</a>, in which over 40 entities submitted ideas for what a GEAR Center could be and how it might operate. Now, our goal is to recognize high-potential GEAR Center models by awarding prizes to those that can propose a workable GEAR Center model through a demonstration of how that model would creatively address one or more <a href="https://www.performance.gov/PMA/Presidents_Management_Agenda.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PMA-related challenges</a> (pg. 4, 7-9).</p> <h4><strong>What is the Prize?</strong></h4> <p>GSA is offering up to three $300,000 cash prizes to the top solutions proposed, as well as selecting up to five additional winners for public recognition. We anticipate that each of the three cash awards will be for solutions that feasibly deliver results tackling different management challenges, but reserve the right to award up to three that propose solutions that address the same PMA-related challenge.</p> <p>Solvers may propose GEAR Center solutions that would:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Transform the way the Federal workforce is recruited, developed, reskilled or deployed.</li> <li>Empower external users to access and use Government data for commercial and other public purposes.</li> <li>Better connect Federal programs with a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the people they serve, and capture the voice of the customer in order to continuously improve Federal services.</li> <li>Solvers can suggest their own ideas to address issues described in the President's Management Agenda.</li> </ul> <p><strong>On May 13, 2019 we hosted a webinar to answer questions</strong>&nbsp;and allow interested Solvers to connect with experts working on PMA challenges. The webinar was broadcast widely and is available online, along with answers to frequently asked questions:&nbsp; <strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/336330824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webinar</a> | <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/document-library/GEAR-Center-Challenge-QA---Update-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frequently Asked Questions</a></strong></p> </div>
