I"ñ<p class="p1">Many Veterans play video games as recreation and sometimes for exercise.Â  Unfortunately, some differently-abled Veterans cannot easily use motion tracking game controllers due to not being able to make the exact motions required by the game or press the correct buttons. The VA Center for InnovationÂ is asking Solvers to create ways to reassign motions and buttons on gaming controllers to provide alternative access for veterans who may be using them in therapy to improve eye hand coordination, fine motor control and/or range of motion. Simple to use, adjustable, adaptable and wireless are key features of these devices. Solvers will be asked to be specific about their ideas and devices. Winners may be able to take their ideas further forward given the VA's goal of taking some of these ideas to a final prototype after the Challenge. Â The VA is launching this challenge on InnoCentive through an Interagency Agreement with NASA's Center of Excellence for Collaborative Innovation.</p>
