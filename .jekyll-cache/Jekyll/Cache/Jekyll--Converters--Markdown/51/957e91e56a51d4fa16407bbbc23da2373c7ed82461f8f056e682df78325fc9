<p><strong>The Problem:</strong>    Venous thromboembolism (VTE), blood clots occurring as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), or both, is an important and growing public health issue. Prevention of healthcare-associated VTE (HA-VTE) is a national hospital safety priority. Many HA-VTEs can be prevented, but VTE prevention strategies are still not being applied regularly or effectively across the United States.    <br /><strong>The Challenge:</strong>    To support and promote HA-VTE prevention, HHS and CDC announce the 2015 HA-VTE Prevention Challenge. The challenge will bring prestige to organizations that invest in VTE prevention, improve understanding of successful implementation strategies at the health system level, and motivate health systems to strengthen their VTE prevention efforts. The top-judged organizations found to have implemented innovative and effective VTE prevention strategies will be recognized as HA-VTE Prevention Champions. CDC will document these successful strategies and highlight the systems, processes, and staffing that contributed to exceptional VTE prevention outcomes achieved by Champions. Champions will receive a cash prize (if eligible) and other forms of recognition.    <br /><strong>The Goal:</strong>    To identify hospitals, multi-hospital systems, hospital networks, and managed care organizations that have implemented an innovative and effective VTE prevention strategy using one or more interventions (e.g. VTE protocols and order sets, risk assessment, electronic alerts, clinical decision support tools, performance monitoring systems and dashboards, patient and/or provider education and awareness, post-discharge follow-up, etc.) designed to increase VTE prevention.    <br /><strong>The Solution?</strong>    There is no one solution! We are looking for successful programs from all types of hospitals—small and large, urban and rural, academic, private, public, federal, and international. In short, we want to know what was successful in your setting!    Entrants of the HA-VTE Prevention Challenge will be asked to describe the VTE prevention strategy and the specific intervention(s) (e.g. implementation of VTE protocols and order sets, risk assessment, electronic alerts, clinical decision support tools, performance monitoring systems and dashboards, patient and/or provider education and awareness, post-discharge follow-up, etc.), methods, and systems used to implement, support and evaluate the strategy. Entrants will be asked to submit at least one quantitative measure showing an increase of VTE prevention (e.g. # of patients assessed for VTE risk, # of at risk patients receiving appropriate VTE prevention, # of patients and/or providers receiving education on VTE prevention, etc.) and/or decrease in HA-VTE rates for the organization’s population of interest.    <br /><strong>The Prizes:</strong>    An estimated 7 of the highest scoring U.S. non-federal hospitals, multi-hospital systems, hospital networks and managed care organizations will be recognized as HA-VTE Prevention Champions and will receive a cash award of $10,000. A maximum of $70,000 will be awarded in this challenge. Additional honorable mention awards, pending availability of funds, may be made if the judges identify more than 7 deserving entries.    Winning submissions from U.S. Federal entities and international entities will be eligible for non-monetary recognition.    In addition, all Champions will be recognized by the CDC. Documentation of the clinical systems and strategies used by Champions to improve VTE prevention will be promoted and shared on the CDC website and attributed to Champions.    <br /><strong>The Judging:</strong>    Challenge submissions will be evaluated by a panel of three to five judges from CDC and other HHS agencies using the information provided on, and in accordance with, the nomination form. The judges will score the nomination form using a rubric based on the following evaluation criteria: methods (30% of score); results (50% of score); and feasibility/utility (20% of score) of the strategy and interventions associated with the intended outcome of interest. Nominees with the highest score will be required to participate in a process to verify their data. Final selection will take into account all the information form the nomination form, the background check, and data verification. Geographic location and population treated may be used to break any ties in the event of tie scores at any point in the selection process. An estimated 7 organizations will be recognized as prize winners.    Some Champions will participate in a post-challenge telephone interview. The interview will include questions about the strategies employed by the organization to achieve high rates of VTE prevention, including barriers and facilitators for those strategies. The interview will focus on systems and processes and should not require preparation time by the Champion. The estimated time for the interview is one hour, which includes time to review the interview protocol with the interviewer, respond to the interview questions, and review a summary report about the Champion’s practices. The summary will be written as a success story and will be posted on the CDC website.    <br /><strong>How to Enter:</strong>    Challenge launches <strong>Monday, November 2, 2015 @ 5:00 pm</strong>! <strong>To enter, go to <a href="http://vte-challenge.com">vte-challenge.com</a> and submit your entry.</strong>  Submissions through challenge.gov will not be accepted.  Questions about the Challenge should be directed to <a href="http://havtechallenge@cdc.gov">havtechallenge@cdc.gov</a> with the word “Challenge” in the subject line.</p>
