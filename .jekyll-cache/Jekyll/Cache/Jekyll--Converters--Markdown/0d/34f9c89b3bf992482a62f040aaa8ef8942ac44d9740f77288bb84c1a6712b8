I"š<h3>Stages</h3>
<p>By the Challenge deadline Solvers should submit a white paper that describes a device for providing direct current power to electronic instruments on rotating shafts meeting the specific Solution Requirements presented in the Detailed Description of the Challenge. This description should be accompanied by a well-articulated rationale supported by literature/patent precedents and include experimental proof-of-concept data obtained as outlined in the Detailed Description of the Challenge.</p>
<p>The total award pool for the Challenge is $250,000. Awards will be available in two phases: an initial Phase 1 award up to $50,000, and a final Phase 2 award reflecting the balance up to $250,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phase 1 Selected Solvers will be informed within six weeks of the Challenge deadline if they have been selected for the initial award and whether a prototype device is requested by the Seeker for experimental validation in a laboratory and/or field-scale demonstration. Following notification, Solvers are expected to have a prototype ready to be shipped within a maximum of 8 weeks, so that the Seeker can start evaluation. Because of these requirements, the whole evaluation period is expected to last up until 6 months from the Challenge Deadline. Phase 1 award may vary from $5,000 to $50,000 for solutions that meet all of the criteria. At the Seekers&rsquo; discretion, the Solver may be invited to attend and assist in activities during prototype evaluation.</p>
<p>Phase 2 awards from the remainder of the total pool of $250,000 will be granted for a novel method that results in a solution experimentally validated, with a minimum award of $25,000. In addition to the direct monetary award Reclamation will invite industry, non-profit organizations, and venture capital representatives for the demonstrations.&nbsp; Participating industry and venture capital representatives will have the ability to seek and secure potential business deals with Solvers.</p>
<p>The Challenge award will be contingent upon results of critical analysis and evaluation by the Seeker and the judging panel appointed by the Seeker.&nbsp; As such, the meeting of the Solution Requirements does not guarantee that the proposed solution will be awarded by the Seeker.&nbsp; Partial cash prizes may be considered for solutions that meet some, but not all, of the criteria.</p>
<p>Submissions to this Challenge must be received by 11:59 PM (US Eastern Time) on December 6, 2018.&nbsp; Late submissions will not be considered.</p>
<h3>Eligibility</h3>
<p>To receive a Phase 1 award, the Solvers will not have to transfer their exclusive IP rights to the Seeker.&nbsp; Instead, Solvers will grant to the Seeker a non-exclusive license to practice their solutions. The Solver will not receive an Award if Solver cannot provide Seeker with the non-exclusive license to the Solution IP on the terms set forth in the Challenge-Specific Agreement. Solvers who have transferred their IP rights in their solution to another party, or otherwise entered into any commercial exclusive arrangement with another for the exploitation of their IP rights in their solution prior to the end of the Challenge shall not be eligible for a Challenge award.&nbsp; Please note that any proposal submitted will not be treated as confidential information.&nbsp; Accordingly, Solvers should take whatever steps they deem necessary to protect their proprietary rights in their solutions prior to submitting their written proposal for consideration in the Challenge (e.g. filing provisional or full patent applications on the solution described in the written proposal submitted prior to submission).&nbsp; See the Challenge-Specific Agreement on the <a href="https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933885">InnoCentive website</a> for full details.</p>
<p>This Challenge is being conducted by the Seeker under the authority of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (15 U.S. Code &sect; 3719) as amended by the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017, which states that cash prize purse awards for this prize competition may only be given to an individual that is a citizen or permanent resident of the United States, or an entity that is incorporated in and whose primary place of business is in the United States, subject to verification by the Seeker before cash prize purses are awarded.</p>
<p><strong>Cash prize purse payments:&nbsp;</strong> Payments will be paid in full to the eligible registered individual, entity, or team selected as a winner.</p>
<p><strong>Registering as a team:&nbsp;</strong> Teams must register to compete by having the Team Leader form a Team Project Room.&nbsp; The Team Leader must be a U.S. citizen, permanent U.S. resident, or representative of a U.S. entity eligible to receive a cash prize.&nbsp; In the case of a team registration, the cash prize purse can be split and paid directly to eligible team members as directed by the registered eligible team leader.&nbsp; The Seeker will not make payment to team members that are not eligible under 15 USC 3719 to receive a cash prize.</p>
<p>Team Project Room requests must be made no later than 1 week prior to the Challenge deadline.&nbsp; Once registered, click on &lsquo;Form a Team&rsquo; at the top of the Challenge page for further instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Participation by those not eligible for cash prizes:&nbsp;</strong> Submissions can be entertained from all Solvers regardless of whether they are U.S. citizens, U.S. permanent residents, or U.S. entities and are eligible to receive non-cash prize awards, if any.&nbsp; Meritorious submissions from non-U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and entities will also be recognized in publications issued by the Seeker announcing the results of the competition, such as press releases.</p>
<p>Full eligibility details and other restrictions are detailed in the Challenge-Specific Agreement on the <a href="https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933885">InnoCentive website</a>.</p>
