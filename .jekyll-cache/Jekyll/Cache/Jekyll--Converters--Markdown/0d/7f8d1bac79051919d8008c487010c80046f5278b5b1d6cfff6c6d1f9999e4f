<h3>JUDGING CRITERIA</h3>
<p>Two rounds of formal judging will determine winners of the prize money, and a period of public voting will determine the winner of a People's Choice Award. The People&rsquo;s Choice Award winner will not receive a monetary prize but will be showcased on the NSF website, through social media, and at public events.</p>
<p><strong>1st Round of Judging</strong></p>
<p>All entries will first be screened for compliance with the rules. All compliant videos will be scored by a panel of judges, using on the following four criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Creativity (20%)</em>: Video is creatively used to showcase NSF-supported work in the mathematical sciences.</li>
<li><em>Clarity and accuracy of mathematical concepts and ideas (20%)</em>: The mathematical concepts and ideas underlying the project are clearly and accurately illustrated throughout the video.</li>
<li><em>Communicating mathematics in an accessible and exciting way (40%)</em>: NSF-supported project work is presented at a level and using language that can be understood by a broad audience of varying ages and mathematical backgrounds. Use of technical terminology and assumption of prior knowledge of the mathematical concepts in the video are limited. Video communicates project ideas, purpose, and/or impact in a way that excites the audience about the mathematical sciences. It has the potential to break down barriers for viewers who may perceive advanced studies and research in the mathematical sciences as inaccessible or have trouble envisioning themselves as future mathematical scientists.</li>
<li><em>Artistic and technical quality (20%)</em>: Video has visual appeal, is refined, and has a high level of both visual and audio quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Judges will evaluate a collection of videos submitted to the same level. Based on the scoring, up to four semifinalists will be identified at each level.</p>
<p><strong>2nd Round of Judging</strong></p>
<p>Judges will review the semifinalists to determine one winning entry for each level. Round 2 judges will not be able to see scores assigned in Round 1 and will score each semifinalist using the same four criteria used in Round 1. In cases where a judge is asked to review for both rounds, she/he will review videos at a different level for each round to ensure that they do not review the same videos twice.</p>
