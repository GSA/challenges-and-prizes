I"s<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Hard Kill Challenge Overview</span></h3>
<p>The Hard Kill Challenge will provide JIDO and other DoD agencies an opportunity to evaluate where current technology is concerning hard killing rotor and fixed wing UASs. This Challenge will consist of three scored phases. The first phase is primarily set-up to verify the ability of each vendorâ€™s C-UAS system to hard kill a UAS. To advance to each subsequent phase, a vendor must hard kill a minimum of one UAS in each phase. This Challenge will only use Group I rotor and fixed wing UASs.  &lt;h3&gt;<span style="color: #993300;">Phase I - Initial Assessment</span>&lt;/h3&gt;  Phase I is the initial C-UAS system assessment phase. During this phase there will be 12 scored test events and four unscored test events.    Six test events will consist of one rotors UAS hovering 50-100m Above Ground Level (AGL) at 250m, 500m and/or 1000m. Each test event will be no longer than 15 minutes. The test events will start at a distance of 250m. Teams must defeat two rotor UASs at each distance to move to the next further distance. It is possible that all six test events will take place at 250m if the team fails to defeat two rotor UASs.    Six test events will consist of one fixed winged UAS flying in an oval pattern 50-100m AGL at 250m. 500m, and 1000m. Each test event will be no longer than 15 minutes. The test events will start at a distance of 250m. Teams must defeat two fixed winged UASs at each distance to move to the next further distance. It is possible that all six test events will take place at 250m if the team fails to defeat two rotor UASs.    For those teams that have defeated a minimum of one UAS (rotor or fixed winged), they will participate in four unscored test events where the Red Team will provide Counter-Counter Measures (CCMs) to the UASs. These test events will start at the farthest distance that the team previously defeat the rotor/fixed winged UAS.    <em><strong>Phase I Scoring</strong></em>.Â  Scoring for each test event is based on a combination of time it takes to defeat the UAS and the distance. See the attachment for more details.    <span style="color: #3366ff;">Teams who have defeated a minimum of one UAS (rotor or fixed winged) will move to Phase II</span>.  &lt;h3&gt;<span style="color: #993300;">Phase II - Single UAS Missions (Rotor &amp; Fixed Wing UASs)</span>&lt;/h3&gt;  Phase II will consist of eight test events. Four test events will consist of a single rotor UAS and four test events consisting of a single fixed wing UAS conducting either an ISR or attack mission. Each mission will start at approximately 3000m from the objective based on the performance specifications of each UAS. The teamâ€™s objective is to defeat the UAS at the farthest possible distance.    <em><strong>Phase II Scoring</strong></em>.Â  Scoring for each test event is based on the distance a UAS is defeated. The farther the distance the higher the score. See the attachment for more details.  &lt;h3&gt;<span style="color: #993300;">Phase III - Swarm UAS Missions (Rotor and Fixed Wing UASs)</span>&lt;/h3&gt;  Phase III will consist of four UAS swarm test events. This test event will be similar to Phase II with the exception being that each mission will consist of multiple UASs. The first two missions will consist of two UASs (one rotor and one fixed wing), the 3rd mission will consist of three UASs (two rotors and one fixed wing) and the 4th mission will consist of three UASs (one rotor and two fixed wings).    <em><strong>Phase III Scoring</strong></em>.Â  Scoring for each test event is based on the distance each UAS is defeated. The farther the distance the higher the score.
