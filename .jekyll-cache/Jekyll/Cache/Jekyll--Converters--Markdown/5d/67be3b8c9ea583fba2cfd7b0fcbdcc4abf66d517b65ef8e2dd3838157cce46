I"¶<h4>Help build a sustainable US food system by putting USDA data into the hands of farmers, researchers, and consumers.</h4>
<p>Being a farmer in America is not for the weak of heart. For decades, it has been a game of both chance and experience - making farming a difficult industry to enter. In fact, the number of entry-level farmers has fallen by 30% since 1987 (<a href="http://www.cfra.org/resources/beginning_farmer">http://www.cfra.org</a>).</p>
<p>For those that do enter this industry, farming is becoming an increasingly data and technology driven activity. Known as ‚Äúprecision farming‚Äù or ‚Äúprecision ag,‚Äù farmers are now utilizing data from satellites, market reports, weather forecasts, surveys, and sensors that provide on-demand GPS monitoring and mapping tools. (<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2012/12/02/high-tech-farming/1741071/">http://www.usatoday.com</a>)</p>
<p>Still, it‚Äôs not enough. American farmers need more data in order to create a sustainable food system for the United States. They need to analyse the food supply coming from farms and ranches and the economics¬†of consumer demand. They need to know how yields have changed over time so they can prepare for and predict future crops. They need to know what is growing well in their area and what isn‚Äôt. Similarly, consumers and researchers want to know where their food is coming from and how we can make US agriculture more sustainable.</p>
<p>The USDA has a tremendous amount of food supply, economic demand, and remote sensing data as part of its Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) and Economic Research Service (ERS), the challenge is to explore how to make this data accessible and provide insights for potential users.    Help create a sustainable, competitive, and healthy US food system. Use USDA data to create working, interactive applications to get farmers the information they need ‚Äì <em>and help feed America.</em></p>
