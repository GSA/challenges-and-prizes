I"˜<p>HRSA's Maternal &amp; Child Health BureauÂ is sponsoring the Word Gap Challenge to spur innovative solutions to promote the early language environment and address the "word gap," the large difference in exposure to language for children from low-income families as compared to children from higher-income families. This challenge will reward the development and testing of scalable innovations that drive behavior change among parents and caregivers.</p>
<p>The goal of the challenge is to develop a low-cost, scalable technologically-based intervention that drives parents and caregivers to talk- and engage in more back-and-forth interactionswith their young children (ages 0-4).</p>
<p>This Challenge, structured in three phases, will reach a diverse population of innovators and solvers, including coders, public health experts, individuals affiliated with academic institutions, research and development communities in the private sector, and others.</p>
<p>All submissions will be evaluated; separate prizes will be awarded for each of the three phases below.</p>
<p>Phase 1: Design    Phase<br /> 2: Development and Small Scale Testing<br />    Phase 3: Scaling</p>
