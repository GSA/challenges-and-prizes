I"©f<p>Today, over 136 million people require humanitarian assistance. Hundreds of thousands of the most vulnerable people in conflict zones are currently unreachable by traditional humanitarian aid delivery. As the length, frequency and scope of armed conflicts increase, it is progressively more difficult to reach affected people in insecure areas with life-saving and life-improving humanitarian assistance.    International aid agencies face challenges in delivering humanitarian aid in conflict-affected contexts, including damaged infrastructure, aid diversion, corruption and threats of violence. Local responders are often better placed to reach affected people in insecure settings, but lack the funding or resources, or the capacity to provide aid in hard-to-reach places.    As the scale of humanitarian emergencies continues to grow at a rate that surpasses the capacity of any one partner or sector to respond, new ways of thinking and working together are imperative. Engagement with the private sector is essential in developing new approaches to complement traditional ways of delivering humanitarian aid. The private sector is often uniquely effective at scaling sustainable solutions and in improving the speed, quality and cost-efficiency of delivering or manufacturing commodities and utilities, recycling products and financing or developing innovative solutions.    To improve assistance in conflict-generated crises, the United States Agency for International Development Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA), the UK Department for International Development (DFID), and Grand Challenges Canada have launched Creating Hope in Conflict: A Humanitarian Grand Challenge.    <strong>THE GRAND CHALLENGE</strong>  We seek life-saving or life-improving innovations to help the most vulnerable and hardest-to-reach people impacted by humanitarian crises caused by conflict. These innovations will involve a connection to the private sector and input from affected communities in order to provide, supply, or locally generate safe drinking water and sanitation, energy, life-saving information, or health supplies and services to help conflict-affected people.    <strong>AREAS OF FOCUS</strong>  The Humanitarian Grand Challenge is focused on addressing the most acute needs in conflict-affected areas that have the potential to be solved by innovation in one or more of the following four areas: (1) safe water and sanitation; (2) energy; (3) life-saving information; or (4) health supplies and services. Innovations must enable local solutions, serve local needs and delivery gaps, overcome common delivery barriers in conflict settings, or improve on the timeliness and cost efficiency of current humanitarian delivery methods. The focus areas are described in detail below.    <em><strong>Safe Water and Sanitation</strong></em>  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Roadblock</span>: Lack of safe water sources and sanitation in conflict settings.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Context</span>: Approximately 53.5 million people in the world‚Äôs most challenging humanitarian emergencies require safe water and sanitation. Adequate access to safe water and basic sanitation is critical to prevent skin disease and waterborne diseases; for example, diarrheal diseases, which is the second leading cause of death globally for children under five, with 88% of deaths attributable to inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene. Yet, managing the spread of diseases in conflict is made particularly difficult by the disruption or destruction of existing waste management, water treatment and distribution systems. People who are displaced by conflict are often at a higher risk of infection by waterborne pathogens because of the resulting poor and crowded living conditions, combined with poor nutrition and limited healthcare.    We invite bold ideas, technologies, processes and approaches that enable rapid provision of safe water and safe disposal of waste and sewage in the most vulnerable households and/or enable implementers to rapidly scale up programs.    <strong><em>Energy</em></strong>  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Roadblock</span>: A lack of reliable, accessible and sustainable electricity options in conflict settings.  Context: It is estimated that 83 million people in the world‚Äôs most challenging humanitarian emergencies are without access to electricity. Currently, much of the electricity in conflict zones comes from generators and is therefore reliant on diesel, which needs costly and difficult transportation, and can also be diverted to fuel weapons of war. Electricity is needed to run:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Health services, such as lighting for surgery, dialysis machines and oxygen manufacturing&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Water pumping and purification&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Household needs&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Information and communications systems&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  We invite bold ideas to generate energy. We are particularly interested in alternative energy solutions that are possible to set up and maintain in conflict situations to power life-saving and life-improving services, such as health, information, water and sanitation, and education.    <strong><em>Life-saving Information</em></strong>  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Roadblock</span>: Conflict impedes access to vital information at three levels: among members of affected populations, among humanitarian organizations, and between humanitarian organizations and affected people.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Context</span>: Information exchange modalities are disrupted or deliberately targeted by armed actors. With disrupted communications and transportation infrastructure, critical information is difficult to gather, communicate and analyze, which denies affected populations the ability to meet their needs locally or to safely connect with humanitarian actors to receive assistance. Delivery of appropriate humanitarian assistance risks delay or failure when information on local conditions is incomplete, outdated or faulty.    We are looking for bold ideas that use and improve access to information and data to increase the impact of humanitarian assistance at the local level, as well as to enable more effective connections for affected populations and humanitarian actors.    <strong><em>Health Supplies and Services</em></strong>  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Roadblock</span>: Lack of sufficient and effective medical supplies and services in conflict.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Context</span>: In the most challenging conflict-affected humanitarian emergencies globally, approximately 44.7 million people lack basic access to medical care. Supply chain disruptions, such as blockades, attacks on humanitarian workers and sieges, make it difficult to import and distribute necessary health supplies. Additionally, health facilities are left without highly skilled staff and lack access to essential medical supplies and services.    We are looking for bold solutions that:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Enable non-expert people to provide quality care&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Empower skilled staff who choose to work in conflict zones&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Allow faster or less costly importation and distribution of quality essential health supplies in conflict zones&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Enable affected communities to manufacture necessary high-quality and safe supplies, or to sterilize and reuse them.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Depending on the quality of proposals received, the Humanitarian Grand Challenge retains the right to narrow the focus to one or more of the above areas. Proposals that address more than one sector are very welcome.    <strong>MEETING THE NEEDS OF AFFECTED POPULATIONS</strong>  The Humanitarian Grand Challenge is focused on helping people who are hardest-to-reach as a result of conflict-generated humanitarian emergencies. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) provides examples of some of the most challenging current humanitarian crises: <a href="https://www.unocha.org/where-we-work/current-emergencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.unocha.org/where-we-work/current-emergencies</a>. We will also consider innovations that are focused on reaching people affected by natural disasters, but they must also be relevant in conflict-generated emergencies.    We encourage innovations that focus on people who are socially marginalized because of their gender, sex, sexuality, religion, age or income, as well as people with disabilities, minorities and people who are stateless.    <strong>AVAILABLE FUNDING</strong>    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Seed Funding</em></span>  The objective of seed funding is to test new ideas and approaches to humanitarian assistance, to determine whether or not they are effective. By the end of the funding period, projects that receive seed funding are expected to demonstrate evidence (e.g., proof of concept), in a controlled or limited setting, that there is greater assistance in the target region, lower reliance on importations, and/or reduction of other significant barrier(s) to obtaining assistance as a result of the project, as well as that the innovation has the potential to be implemented at scale in other contexts.    Through this Request for Proposals, the Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners will award seed funding of up to $250,000 CAD per project over a maximum of twenty-four (24) months. In addition to award funding, awardees may receive additional support, such as publicity and marketing promotional support; access to exclusive industry, investor and partner networking events; and basic acceleration support, mentorship opportunities and partnership brokering.    The level of funding requested should be sufficient to assure completion of the goals in the stated time frame and must be fully justified.    We expect to award 10‚Äì15 seed grants through this Request for Proposals. At the end of the seed funding stage, if having achieved proof of concept, innovations may be invited to apply to the transition-to-scale funding track.    To receive seed funding, applicants must demonstrate potential relevance to or identify potential opportunities for collaboration with the private sector.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Transition to Scale (TTS) Funding</em></span>  Strategic partnerships are required for the transition to scale and sustainability of innovative solutions.    Matched funding (cash) from strategic partners for activities that further the growth, development, commercialization or adoption of the innovation (e.g., manufacturing, distribution, marketing, networks) will be interpreted as an increased commitment by a partner. Most awardees will be required to secure a 1:1 match within the TTS funding period; however, this will be assessed on a case-by-case basis during the due diligence process. Strategic partners may provide human and other non-financial resources to the project activities; however, awardees are not allowed to rely only upon these types of in-kind contributions to meet the matching requirements.    Through this Request for Proposals, the Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners will award Transition To Scale funding of up to $1,000,000 CAD per project over a maximum of twenty-four (24) months. The level of funding requested should be sufficient to assure completion of the goals in the stated timeframe and must be fully justified.    We expect to invest in two to four Transition to Scale projects; they may be grants, repayable grants, interest-free loans, interest-bearing loans, convertible debt, pay-on-results contracts or a combination thereof. The choice of investment structure is informed by (i) the organization‚Äôs stage and path to scale (e.g., for-profit or non-profit), (ii) the structure‚Äôs ability to attract additional sources of capital, including private partners, as follow-on investors, (iii) the potential effect on the intervention‚Äôs impact and on the organization‚Äôs sustainability, including its ability to become self-sustaining, (iv) the desire to encourage return of funds when investments scale successfully and profitably.    The Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners will support networking of funded innovators with private sector, humanitarian actors and other stakeholders to increase the likelihood of success. Technical and advisory support may be provided to nurture the scalability and sustainability of humanitarian innovations. In addition, awardees may receive additional support, such as publicity and marketing promotional support; access to exclusive industry, investor and partner networking events; and basic acceleration support, mentorship opportunities and partnership brokering.    The provision of funds to innovators is subject to the release of funds to Grand Challenges Canada from our funder(s).    <strong>FOCUS ON RESULTS</strong>  The ultimate outcomes of interest for this Humanitarian Grand Challenge are lives saved and lives improved of conflict-affected people. Other qualitative and quantitative results should be collected to best demonstrate the impact of the innovation.    Given that the true impact of innovations is in the future, proposals must include a plan of how relevant immediate and intermediate indicators will be monitored and evaluated over the life of the project.    For innovations that are not successful, it is expected innovators will be able to articulate why they did not work, in order to accelerate progress in the sector. Dependent on funding, we aim to bring successful innovators together to share lessons learned and ideas.    <strong>COMMUNICATING RESULTS</strong>  Communicating results is an important part of the project‚Äôs accountability to the Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners and other key stakeholders. Innovators should consider how results will be disseminated in order to drive the innovation‚Äôs impact, scale and sustainability. While communicating results through scientific publications can be an effective, this should not be the primary objective of projects. For more information see Appendix A.    <strong>ROLE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR</strong>  Given the current scale of humanitarian needs, this challenge is too great for one sector to solve alone. Private sector approaches to testing, effectively scaling sustainable solutions, improving the speed, quality and cost-efficiency of manufacturing commodities and utilities, recycling products and  financing innovative solutions can result in more effective and impactful solutions. The private sector can contribute valuable technical expertise, risk management, and access to networks and data, and may often have detailed knowledge about local conditions. For instance, small local businesses are often critical in providing life-saving and life-improving commodities in the wake of armed conflict.    Innovators are encouraged to engage the core competencies of the private sector into their design or partner with the private sector in order to maximize the impact of their innovations. To receive seed funding, applicants must demonstrate potential relevance to, or identify potential opportunities for collaboration with, the private sector. To receive transition-to-scale funding, engagement with the private sector is required.    Innovators are expected to engage private sector actors who can help to fill a critical gap needed to scale or improve their innovation. This may include technical expertise, distribution channels, access to data, local knowledge, financial backing, or other core capacities or collaboration. In some circumstances, the Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners may be able to assist in finding appropriate private sector partners, as long as applicants are able to articulate their needs. Though it is strongly preferred, secured commitment of private sector engagement are not required at the time of application.    The private sector is defined as for-profit entities at the local, national or multinational level, and refers to the following organizations and actors:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Private for-profit entities, such as a business, corporation, or private firms&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Private equity or private financial institutions, including private investment firms, mutual funds or insurance companies&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Private investors (individuals or groups)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Private business or industry associations, including but not limited to chambers of commerce and related types of entities&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Private grant-making foundations or philanthropic entities.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Inclusion of the private sector in applications may be either through financial or in-kind engagement, or collaboration.    Private sector entities are also encouraged to apply for funding.    <strong>INTEGRATED INNOVATION</strong>  Projects are expected to take an Integrated Innovation¬Æ approach, defined as the coordinated application of scientific/technological, social and business innovation, to develop solutions to complex challenges. This approach does not discount the singular benefits of each of these types of innovation alone, but rather highlights the powerful synergies that can be realized by aligning all three. For more info, please see: <a href="http://www.grandchallenges.ca/funding-opportunities/integratedinnovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.grandchallenges.ca/funding-opportunities/integratedinnovation/</a>.    <strong>SCALE AND SUSTAINABILITY</strong>  For the Humanitarian Grand Challenge, sustainability refers to the ability for successful innovations to be readily deployed in ongoing and future contexts, and scale refers to the ability for successful innovations to reach the highest number of people who will benefit as possible. Proposals should convincingly describe how their projects will eventually reach scale and be sustained. Innovators should use seed funding to test paths to scale and sustainability, and must have a robust plan and proven concept in order to receive transition-to-scale funding.    Transition To Scale applicants must already have developed a strong plan for scale and sustainability, including commitments from key stakeholders and partners needed to proceed along a path to scale and sustainability.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Understanding of Conflict-Generated Crises</em></span>  To help ensure sustainable impact at scale, it is essential that project teams include individuals with an understanding of the local social, political and economic context. In doing so, projects can better address the needs of affected people and identify risks to project success.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Stakeholder Engagement</em></span>  People affected by conflict and those who will ultimately make decisions about the use of the solution, such as humanitarian agencies (local, national or international), United Nations agencies, Red Cross entities or non-traditional responders (faith-based groups, local community groups) are expected be engaged at the outset and throughout the life of the project. Input and engagement of these types of organizations throughout the project lifecycle is crucial, as they will be involved in the evaluation process. This will help to ensure that the solution will be poised for initial adoption and subsequent adaptation, leading to greater impact. Additionally, stakeholders can offer insight on their community and identify the factors necessary for project success.    <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, GENDER EQUALITY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND¬†</strong><strong>INCLUSION</strong>  Innovators funded under this Humanitarian Grand Challenge must comply with Grand Challenges Canada‚Äôs policies on Environmental Sustainability, Gender Equality, Human Rights and Inclusion. Environmental Sustainability Applicants are required to commit to ensuring that the innovation will not have material adverse environmental effects, including but not limited to long-term and cumulative effects. Where possible, innovators should incorporate having positive environmental effects throughout the project.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Gender Equality</em></span>  The Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners are committed to furthering principles of gender equality in the projects funded, with the following objectives: (1) advancing women‚Äôs equal participation with men as decision-makers in shaping the sustainable development of their societies; (2) supporting women and girls in the realization of their full human rights; and (3) reducing gender inequalities. Female applicants are strongly encouraged to apply.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Human Rights and Inclusion</em></span>  The Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners are committed to furthering principles of human rights and inclusion in the innovations funded. Innovations should take into account the voices of those who are particularly marginalized in the design and implementation of the innovation, to ensure that their needs are addressed appropriately.    <strong>GLOBAL ACCESS, DATA ACCESS AND ETHICS</strong>  The Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners are committed to fostering meaningful access to supported innovations for the target population of each funded project, promoting prompt and open dissemination of research findings and data arising from funded activities, and ensuring that funded research is conducted in a manner that complies with relevant ethical standards. These commitments are embodied in Grand Challenges Canada‚Äôs Global Access Policy, Data Access Policy and Ethics Policy, which should be carefully reviewed by all applicants before submission.    <strong>RISK MANAGEMENT, SAFETY, ANTI-TERRORISM, ANTI-CORRUPTION, ANTI-BRIBERY</strong>  Proposals will need to comply with all relevant U.S. and Canadian legislation, including anti-bribery and anti-terrorism legislation. Funding will not be given to any person or organisation named in US, UK, European Union, World Bank, Canadian, or United Nations Security Council sanctions; we may add to this list as more partners join the challenge. All innovators are expected to manage material risks. For projects that include work in insecure locations, proposals will require details about the management of safety and security risks as they pertain to both people and assets. Proposals must also explain how corruption will be avoided, and what steps will be taken to avoid diversion of aid away from affected people.    <strong>WHAT WE WILL NOT FUND</strong>  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Formal education&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Approaches that utilize security-related surveillance, weapons, force or similar technologies&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Discovery science, merely capacity-building initiatives, ongoing programmatic funding or infrastructure development&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Projects that involve establishing proof of concept of innovations for which the core intellectual property rights are owned by a third-party institution, unless either: (a) the third-party institution has granted the applicant sufficient license rights to the innovation to permit eventual scaling in relevant countries, or (b) the third-party institution is willing to sign an undertaking to Grand Challenges Canada committing to comply with Grand Challenges Canada‚Äôs Global Access Policy: <a href="http://www.grandchallenges.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Global-AccessPolicy_25May2016_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.grandchallenges.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Global-AccessPolicy_25May2016_EN.pdf</a>.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  All criteria are subject to change as new funders join the challenge; updates will be published on the ‚ÄúFrequently Asked Questions‚Äù section of the Humanitarian Grand Challenge website.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Activities and Deliverables</em></span>  Innovators funded under this program will be expected to engage in the following activities and provide the specific deliverables listed below, in order to demonstrate project progress and success:  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Performance reporting focused on utilization of funds and outcomes achieved. The frequency of reporting will be every three or six months, depending on our assessment of project and institutional risk.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Dissemination of knowledge in a timely manner, including through social media, open access publications, depositing of data into publicly accessible repositories, press releases, conferences, stakeholder engagement, etc. Acknowledgement of the Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners will be required.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;A final report that accounts for financial expenditures and that captures a clear assessment of the impact of the project. Please note that a 5% hold back of funds will be applied to all funding under this program, to be released to innovators upon submission of a satisfactory final report and full justification of costs.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Continued post-grant updates on impact, global access, data access and management of intellectual property rights in supported innovations. Instructions for reporting will be provided to successful recipients. Written progress reports and conversations via teleconference may be required to satisfy reporting requirements. In addition to the above-mentioned activities, innovators will be expected to:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Participate in public engagement activities.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Contribute to the learning agenda for specific challenges, including through participation in meetings, such as the annual Grand Challenges meetings.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  Funded innovators must retain supporting project documentation, including financial records, and may be audited by Grand Challenges Canada, DFID and/or USAID at any time up until March 31, 2028; associated requirements will be reflected in funding agreements.    ¬†</p>
