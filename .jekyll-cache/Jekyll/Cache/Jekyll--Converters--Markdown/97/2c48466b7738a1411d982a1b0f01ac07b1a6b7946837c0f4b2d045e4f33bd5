I"u<p>The Seeker is developing a multi-spectral visual system; however, fusing the inputs of offset optical sources results in parallax - a perceived change in the position of an object due to the offset positions of the optical sensors. This Challenge seeks a system and/or algorithm that provides near real-time parallax correction for multiple, offset optical sources.</p>
