Ideally, the narrative will include evidence of the nominee‚Äôs impact in the community or on the program or other local projects, as well as evidence to support the nominee‚Äôs work or service as innovative, a best practice and/or a highly compelling and motivating experience.    Submissions may also include photos. Photos should support the narrative submission and not replace it. Photos are encouraged as they are often very helpful in telling the complete service story. Please note that photos are not required.    By submitting a nomination, each participant automatically confers on CNCS an irrevocable, nonexclusive, and unrestricted license to use the submitted content for purposes consistent with the agency‚Äôs national service mission. This includes the right to copy, reproduce, display, or distribute the content of the submission, and to make derivative works based upon the submission or a substantial portion of it without attribution or prior permission.    <strong>Instructions¬†for Writing the Nomination Narrative:</strong>  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Each nomination should specify from the eligibility list the program with which it is affiliated.

Note that nominations¬†will not¬†be considered complete or reviewed without the full name and contact information for the nominator.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Select <u>only one program affiliation and only one nomination category</u> for each submission. In the event a program and individual are both eligible to be nominated, submit two separate nominations: one for the new or enhanced program and one for the member, following the award category descriptions.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Describe how the nominee exemplifies excellence in AmeriCorps service or programming. Consider these questions: what made the service excellent? what data can you provide to support the impact the member or program made?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Provide details that vividly illustrate the significance of the nominated member service/program. Details should clearly show how the nominated service goes above and beyond the excellent service that is expected from all AmeriCorps members and programs each year.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Tailor the nomination narrative to the Excellence in AmeriCorps¬†Awards instructions.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Carefully proof read and review the nomination for completeness before submitting it in the Challenge Program.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  ¬†    <strong>Format for Submitting a Nomination:</strong>    Nominations must be submitted as a Solution in the Challenge Program.    <strong>Limitations:</strong>    Individuals and programs may submit no more than one nominee in each award category.
