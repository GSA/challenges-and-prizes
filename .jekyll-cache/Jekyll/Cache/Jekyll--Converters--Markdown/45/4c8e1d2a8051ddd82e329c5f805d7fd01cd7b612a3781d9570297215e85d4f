A team can also include engineers, IT, business or other professionals in the biomedical science/health care field.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Winners are encouraged to submit the minimum viable proof (MVP) report 6 months after the prize payment.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  For more information about the Rules for Participation, go to    <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-13/pdf/2016-13936.pdf">https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-13/pdf/2016-13936.pdf</a>    ¬†    <strong>Submission Requirements</strong>    Each submission for this Challenge requires a complete ‚ÄúSubmission Package.‚Äù The Submission Package includes a 4-page written proposal describing an idea and 5-min video introducing the team. Both the idea and the Founders will be evaluated.    <em><strong>In the proposal:</strong></em>  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Describe your research idea that would further an understanding of neurobiology as it relates to SUD and that is intended to be the basis for a successful start-up. (1 page)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Convince the Challenge reviewers of your technical competence as a biomedical scientist. Be brief, selective and persuasive. Do not use the NIH Bibliographic Sketch format. (0.5 page)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Describe, in as many details as possible, what the prototype of your product would look like. Then, walk the Challenge reviewers through the typical use of the product, using simple terms and instructions. (1.5 pages)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Explain the methods you will use (how, when, where, whom) to determine whether the product is needed by the target audience and whether that audience would be willing to pay for the product. (1 page)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  The proposal must consist of a PDF file with at least 1 inch margins and no more than four (4) pages long. Font size must be no smaller than 11 point Arial. All submissions must be in English. The Contestants must not use HHS‚Äôs logo or official seal or the logo of NIH or NIDA in the submissions, and must not claim federal government endorsement.    A brief video (link to YouTube) must be no longer than five (5) minutes. If the Challenge submission is from the team of Founders, the entire team must participate in the submitted video.    <strong><em>In the YouTube video:</em></strong>  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Tell NIDA something, in one minute or less, that can illustrate the drive or the desire of each founder to develop a product that would further an understanding of neurobiology as it relates to SUD and that is intended to be the basis for a successful start-up.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Tell NIDA something about each founder that shows a high level of scientific and entrepreneurial ability.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Tell NIDA something about each founder that shows a high level of perseverance and grit.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Tell NIDA about a time when your great idea was rejected. What was your response?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Tell NIDA how you design scientific experiments in general.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;</p>
