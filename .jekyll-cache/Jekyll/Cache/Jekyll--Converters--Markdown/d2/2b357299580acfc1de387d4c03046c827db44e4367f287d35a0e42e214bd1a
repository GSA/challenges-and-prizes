<p><span lang="EN">Fifty-three percent (53%) of small business owners report there &ldquo;are few or no qualified applicants for the positions they [are] trying to fill.&rdquo; The U.S. Department of Labor estimates that there are millions of unfilled jobs in the United States. Moreover, many businesses not only face a challenge when attempting to find individuals with the technical or hard skills needed to perform the work required by their industries, but also have difficulty finding individuals with the soft skills necessary to be successful in the workplace.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">SBA believes that existing Makerspaces are uniquely positioned to help address this problem.&nbsp; The non-profit organization Maker City posits a strong connection between makerspaces and workforce development in U.S. cities, with numerous benefits including:&nbsp; embracing independent work and self-employment, focus on new forms of vocational education, opportunity to focus on &ldquo;jobs in the middle&rdquo; which match makers to those seeking traditional employment, development of new forms of apprenticeship, and a shift to new forms of credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp; SBA proposes a pilot program that will utilize existing Makerspaces to provide the necessary job specific and soft skills training and, to the extent feasible, any required industry or trade certifications (the &ldquo;MaTCH Pilot Competition&rdquo;).&nbsp; The goal of the The Makerspace Training, Collaboration, and Hiring (MaTCH) Pilot Competition, upon successful completion of the training program, is to have all program graduates immediately placed in positions with previously identified employers that are in need of skilled labor and have committed to employing a set number of program graduates.</span></p>
