<p>The judging panel may be composed of federal and/or non-federal scientists, engineers, and other technical experts, including subject matter experts from the listed partners for this Challenge. All persons or entities that submit a proposal will receive a high-level evaluation and be notified as to the status of their submission. Decisions by EPA cannot be contested.</p>

<h4 id="judging-criteria">Judging Criteria</h4>

<p>Submissions will be judged by how they address the criteria listed below.</p>

<h4 id="this-challenge-is-intended-to-encourage-the-development-of-new-approaches-technologies-or-technology-combinations-that-meet-the-following-objectives">This challenge is intended to encourage the development of new approaches, technologies, or technology combinations that meet the following objectives:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Must be applicable for use on unspent aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) from unused AFFF concentrates containing 3 percent and/or 6 percent PFAS;</li>
  <li>Must destroy at least 99 percent of the PFAS in unused AFFF concentrates, including PFAS byproducts that may form by volatilization, particulates, and leaching from effluents;</li>
  <li>Must demonstrate scalability and cost effectiveness for a defined quantity over thermal methods used to treat AFFF.</li>
</ol>

<p>Solvers are not required to give up any of their intellectual property rights to EPA and its partners to be eligible to receive an award.</p>

<p><strong>Additional features that are desired (but not required) of submitted PFAS destruction technologies/approaches:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Demonstrates compatibility with current production and destruction practices;</li>
  <li>Avoids creating other toxic residues after destruction of PFAS, including hazardous chemicals identified in EPAâ€™s ToxCast database, <a href="https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists/EPAPFASINV">https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists/EPAPFASINV</a>;</li>
  <li>Is currently accessible in the marketplace or near market ready.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The ideal technology would:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Perform onsite destruction of at least 99 percent of PFAS in AFFF formulations;</li>
  <li>Be currently on the market or near market;</li>
  <li>Destroy parent PFAS compounds;</li>
  <li>Destroy short-chain PFAS byproducts (e.g., CF4) if volatilization occurs;</li>
  <li>Destroy or neutralize any unwanted byproducts (e.g., HF) that would need to be incinerated or landfilled in a hazardous waste facility;</li>
  <li>Be more cost effective than thermal destruction;</li>
  <li>Have good environmental and public health outcomes (e.g., does not transfer PFAS or any unwanted byproducts into other media);</li>
  <li>Be potentially applicable to other PFAS waste streams (e.g., biosolids, contaminated ground water, etc).</li>
</ul>
