I"ë<p>We need your help in building protocols that make up the Disruption-Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) that can work over time delayed communications links and can hop from point to point using a store and forward approach across disrupted links. Specifically, we are working to secure all of the communications using these protocols and to ensure all of the open standard implementations are interoperable.    This challenge is provided by the NASA Tournament Lab (NASA/Harvard/TopCoder).</p>
