Â For winning team entries, NEH will reimburse travel expenses for only one person from the team. This person will be the contact person listed on the entry form. If this person is not available, he or she must designate a replacement from the team. Only persons listed on the original entry form may have their travel expenses reimbursed by NEH. Â All other persons accompanying the winner/team representative must arrange and fund their own travel and accommodations.Â  Awards and travel expense reimbursements may be subject to federal income taxes, and NEH will comply with the Internal Revenue Service withholding and reporting requirements, where applicable.    <strong>Basis upon which Winner Will Be Selected</strong>    NEH staff will review entries, and will send the top submissions to a panel of expert judges.Â  NEH will select a judging panel consisting of three outside experts, chosen for their achievements in the humanities and digital humanities. Â Judges will be fair and impartial. A judge may not have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a registered contestant in the competition. Judges will fully comply with all applicable government ethics requirements for federal employees.    NEH staff and judges will use the following criteria to judge the submitted entries:  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Strong humanities content. Entries must address a subject or idea in the humanities.Â  NEH interprets the humanities broadly, including history, language, linguistics, literature, jurisprudence, philosophy, archaeology, comparative religion, ethics, art history, and the humanistic social sciences.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Impact and use of data. NEH will judge entries on creative selection of data, exploration of questions in the humanities for which big data provides insight, and/or innovative techniques for data use. Â Entries should uncover trends, display insights, explore a theme, or tell a story.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;While entrants are welcome to use existing software or tools, as well as other datasets, to create their projects, NEH will judge entries on originality, meaning the novelty of approach using data to address a humanities theme.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;User appeal and clarity. Because NEH and the Library of Congress will promote winning entries to showcase the many uses for <em>Chronicling America</em> data, projects should be easily understood by a general public audience.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  The judging panel will judge the submissions to advise representatives of NEH, who will choose the final winning entries. Â All judging will take place between on or about June 15, 2016, and on or about July 15, 2016.Â  For questions or further information, please see the contact information listed above.</p>
