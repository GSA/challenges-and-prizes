This should also include the names and unique CAS numbers (if available) for any active and inactive ingredients and a description of how these may decompose in the environment and into what chemicals.</li>
          <li>Environmental Performance: A quantitative summary (including any relevant graphs or tables) of any published or unpublished results of environmental performance, including comparisons of rates of loss relative to conventional fertilizer for N (e.g. leaching, runoff, ammonia volatilization, nitrous oxide emissions), and P (e.g. leaching, runoff) if relevant;</li>
          <li>Agronomic Performance: A quantitative summary (including any relevant graphs or tables) of any published or unpublished results of agronomic performance, including yields under various conditions, rates of growth, kernel production, and net cost (e.g. return on investment, ROI) relative to conventional fertilizer practices;</li>
          <li>Compatibility: Describe how your technology is or may be integrated into existing farming machinery and practices (e.g. transport, storage, application) to the level of specificity possible given the degree of technological maturity.</li>
