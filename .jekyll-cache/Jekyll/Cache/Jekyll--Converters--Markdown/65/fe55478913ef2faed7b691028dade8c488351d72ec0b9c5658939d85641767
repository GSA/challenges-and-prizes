I"C<p>1 Sep 2015        All data sources used must be published in accessible data repositories. Unpublished data can be submitted to the NIST materials repository at    <a href="https://materialsdata.nist.gov/dspace/xmlui/community-list"><span style="color: #0563c1; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">NIST Materials Data Repository</span></a>    31 Mar 2016     Final deadline for submitting a research report for consideration.    11 May 2016     Winners are announced    16 Oct 2016      Invited winners present their work at Materials Science &amp; Technology 2016 in Salt Lake City, UT.    <strong>Project Criteria:</strong>    This challenge requires only a written research report in the format of a peer-reviewed scientific publication to be submitted. The submitted report should include the following:  &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;A clear and concise description of the technical approach (methods) used to solve one of the two Challenges listed in the challenge description.  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;The approach should primarily be based on data analytic techniques (e.g. machine learning, Bayesian Neural Networks, etc.) using existing accessible data to derive new information in materials science and engineering.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;A discussion of how this approach and solution compares against the state of the art.  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;If the approach identifies a new material composition, material structure, or family of compositions, the solution will be evaluated against the degree to which the predicted and/or demonstrated range of properties provide significant improvement over currently known materials for a specific or variety of industrial applications. An analysis of the ability for or actual demonstration of practical synthesis of the material composition should be addressed in the report.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;If the approach addresses modeling the linkage between at least two elements of material processing, structure, and/or property, a quantitative description of material structure (e.g. microstructure) must be included in the model. The solution will be evaluated against the degree to which the new physical insight solves longstanding gaps in our ability to accurately model material behavior across length and/or temporal scales.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;For either Challenge, the report should address steps taken to validate the solution. The solution will be evaluated against the degree to which commonly accepted means of validation were used (e.g. complementary experimental testing, use of training versus validation data, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;The new techniques and/or knowledge generated in this work will be evaluated for their likelihood to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in materials science and engineering or provide a path forward for a new industrial product.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Citation(s) to the accessible data used in solving the Challenge and other relevant literature.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong> </strong>All materials data used in the challenge must meet the following criteria:  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Accessibility: data must be publically available via the internet. Solvers wishing to use their own materials data for analysis in this challenge must post the data in a data repository that is accessible.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Provenance: data sources used must have sufficient supporting information (metadata) to enable reuse by researchers outside the original research effort.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Discoverability: data must be discoverable and citable through a means such as a resolvable Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) or, ideally, a Persistent Identifier (PID).&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;The results of the approach must not have been previously publically presented nor published&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  The awards will be paid to the best submission(s) <strong>as solely determined by the review committee</strong>. The total payout will be $50,000, with at least one award being no smaller than $25,000 and no award being smaller than $5,000.    In addition to the monetary awards, <strong>winning Solvers will be invited to participate (present their research and engage the audience in a question and answer session) in a conference session at Materials</strong> <strong>Science &amp; Technology 2016</strong>, to be held October 24-27, 2016, Salt Lake City, Utah. Travel expenses associated with attending and presenting at the conference will be covered by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) up to a maximum of $3,000 per submission.    <strong>All submitted ideas may be made publicly available </strong>(at the AFRL’s discretion) in their entirety, to foster open discussion and evaluation of the content generated by the Challenge.  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;To receive an award, the Solvers will not have to transfer their exclusive IP rights to the US Government , instead, they will grant to the US Government <em>non-exclusive license</em> to practice their solutions. Other arrangements might be considered, if a license cannot be granted.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt; Submissions to this Challenge must be received by 11:59 PM (US Eastern Time) on 31-Mar-2016. <strong>Late submissions will not be considered.</strong>&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;After the Challenge deadline, the Seeker will complete the review process and make a decision with regard to the Winning Solution(s). All Solvers that submitted a proposal will be notified on the status of their submissions; however, <strong>no detailed evaluation of individual submissions will be provided</strong>.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  <strong>Eligibility</strong><strong>:</strong> Employees of the US Government  organizations (U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Science Foundation) may participate in the Challenge and receive Honorable Mention in the MS&amp;T 2016 conference session but are ineligible to receive award money or travel funds to MS&amp;T 2016.</p>
