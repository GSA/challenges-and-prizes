I"®<p>Hackathon projects may include the following:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong>Green House Gas (GHG) Reduction Visualization</strong> â€“ The Office of Governmentwide Policy (OGP) has been working to create an analytical framework and tool to support agencies in meeting the goals outlined in a recent Executive Order 13693 â€˜Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decadeâ€™, regarding greenhouse gas emission reductions. Â The model currently uses several variables to help agencies examine how increasing their use of E-85 capable vehicles and replacing gas-powered vehicles with E-85 capable vehicles would affect their total greenhouse gas emissions. Â Skills desired include database coding ability (<u>g.</u>, SQL language), analytical research, and experience using data visualization software.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong>Data Center Consolidation Mashup and Tool</strong> â€“ Multiple stakeholders including the White House, Congress, and government agencies share a common interest in better utilizing government data centers. Â This has led to multiple report generation from multiple sources to better understand power consumption and data center utilization and efficiency. Â The purpose of this challenge is to mashup different datasets into visualization and application for all stakeholders to utilize. Â Skills desired include web and application developers, user experience (UX) designers, data scientists, and data center SMEs.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong>Travel Challenge 2.0 App Development</strong> â€“ As a continuation of a Travel Challenge held in 2014, GSA is looking for developers to take the Travel Application to the next level. Â Developed in Python code, this tool is close to production quality and needs some finishing code and design ideas. Â Skills desired include Python developers and UX designers.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Participants will be provided all final project ideas, existing code, and publicly available datasets in advance of the event.Â  Event information will be posted on the following page, <u>http://open.gsa.gov/Digital-Innovation-Hackathon-Fall2015</u>, and will be updated as necessary.</p>
