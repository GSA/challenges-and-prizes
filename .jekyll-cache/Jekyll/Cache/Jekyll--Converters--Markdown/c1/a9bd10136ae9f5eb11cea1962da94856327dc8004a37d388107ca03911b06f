I"½<p>The Asteroid Data Hunter challenge, conducted through the Harvard NASA Tournament Lab on the Topcoder platform, is a series of contests tasking competitors to develop a significantly improved algorithm to identify asteroids in images from ground-based telescopes. The winning solution will increase the detection sensitivity, minimize the number of false positives, ignore imperfections in the data, and run effectively on all computers.</p>
