<p>EPA, in collaboration with other agencies, is seeking demonstrations of the use of data and information from nutrient sensors to inform decisions and actions that address nutrient management.&nbsp; The total prize amount for this Challenge is $100,000; up to two winning teams will share the prize.&nbsp; This is Stage II of the Challenge; <strong><a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/nutrient-sensor-action-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stage I</a></strong> was a call for action plans, which was completed September 2017.</p>
<hr />
<h4>THE CHALLENGE</h4>
<p>Excess nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in the nation&rsquo;s waters is one of the costliest and most challenging environmental problems we face.&nbsp; Over the last 50 years, the amount of nutrients entering into our waters has escalated, and is now one of the top causes of water quality impairment. Protecting human health and the environment from adverse impacts of excessive nutrients is a national priority.</p>
<p>Many organizations and communities are interested in making use of sensors to provide improved spatial and temporal data that can help inform decisions and actions to protect and restore our nation&rsquo;s water resources.</p>
<p>This Challenge calls for teams to design and implement an approach that utilizes nutrient sensors and resulting data to improve decisions and actions resulting in more effective nutrient management.</p>
<hr />
<h4>ELIGIBILITY</h4>
<p>The Nutrient Sensor Action Challenge is open to communities, tribes, states and other organizations in the United States interested in deploying nutrient sensors to address an important nutrient-related water quality issue.</p>
<p>Organizations should be currently engaged in water quality monitoring and have some level of experience using sensors, managing data, and communicating that information.</p>
<p><strong>Participation in Stage I of the Challenge is not a requirement for participation in Stage II</strong>.</p>

<ul> <li><strong>Will judges need to have real-time access to the data?</strong> <ul> <li>Data needs to be made available to the Challenge Administrators by November 1, 2018.&nbsp; The Challenge requires data to be made available in interoperable way, meaning the judges can access and see the data via web services. A data 'download' will not be accepted at the end.&nbsp; Teams must set up their data system in such a way that the data will be shareable in a standard format over standard communication protocols. A goal of this challenge is to promote standard ways of sharing and formatting sensor data to encourage interoperability and sharing of water monitoring data. See Challenge language for data standards accepted by the Challenge judges.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>When will awards be made?</strong> <ul> <li>Spring 2019</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Who are the partners in the Challenge?</strong> <ul> <li>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</li> <li>U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)</li> <li>NOAA-directed U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS)</li> <li>U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)</li> <li>National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST)</li> <li>Cleveland Water Alliance (CWA)</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Are slides from previous webinars available?</strong> <ul> <li>Slides from previous webinars have been posted to Challenge.gov</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>How can I be added to the e-newsletter distribution list?</strong> <ul> <li>All teams that register will be signed up automatically for the newsletter.&nbsp; For individuals not participating that would like to be added to the distribution list, email the request to Denice Shaw,&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-04ded0f9-7fff-a78e-ef0f-4e6f6fe0caa5"><a href="mailto:Shaw.Denice@epa.gov">Shaw.Denice@epa.gov</a>&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; <li><strong>Who can I contact if I have questions?</strong> <ul> <li>Please direct any requests for clarifications and additional information about this Challenge to Denice Shaw,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Shaw.Denice@epa.gov">Shaw.Denice@epa.gov</a></li> </ul> </li> &lt;/ul&gt;
