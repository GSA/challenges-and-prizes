<p>The entry submission package must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>white paper that clearly describes the networking technology to be considered</li>
  <li>quad chart where all content such as text, pictures, diagrams, etc. are provided pre-approved for public release</li>
</ul>

<p>In order for an entry to be considered, a white paper must be submitted no later than July 27, 2021, in accordance with the below submission guidelines.</p>

<p>Each entry will be initially assessed utilizing the criteria set forth under the section, <strong>Assessment Criteria ‚Äì Networks Prize Challenge Invitations.</strong> Following initial assessment, Participants may be invited to advance to the second assessment in the Challenge.</p>

<p>If invited to advance, participants will be required to submit the networking technology described in the initial white paper and quad chart no later than October 22, 2021. The networking technology will be assessed per <strong>Assessment Criteria ‚Äì Networks Prize Challenge</strong> during presentation and demonstration November 4, 2021.</p>

<p>In the event the submission package does not include the sufficient level of detail to assess technical approach, or other, the Government team may request clarification throughout the evaluation.</p>
