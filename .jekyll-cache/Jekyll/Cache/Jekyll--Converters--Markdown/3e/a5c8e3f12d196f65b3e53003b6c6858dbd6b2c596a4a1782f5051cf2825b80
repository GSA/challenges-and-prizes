<p><strong>General Overview</strong></p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Energy Solar DecathlonÂ® is a collegiate competition, â€‹comprising 10 Contests, that challenges student teams to design and build â€‹highly efficient, innovative, low-carbon buildings â€‹powered by renewable energy. The 10 Contests of the Solar Decathlon address building science, energy efficiency, occupant experience, community needs, affordability, resilience, and embodied environmental impact.</p>

<p>Teams competing in the Solar Decathlon Build Challenge work during a two-year period to design, build, and operate their houses in their own region. The <a href="https://www.solardecathlon.gov/event/challenges-build.html">2023 Build Challenge</a> consists of a design and construction phase. First, the teams design their homes through April 2022. The top 20 teams who are approved to proceed will complete construction activities through April 2023 with the support of $50,000 of prize funding.</p>

<p>During the Competition Event, teams will be evaluated on how well they meet the nationâ€™s rapidly evolving demand for new and retrofit homes that are innovative, cost-effective, net zero energy, resilient, grid-interconnected, and efficient that respond to targeted community needs. 
Each home will be evaluated based on 10 Contests, some juried and some measured locally on the building site. Partnerships with building owners are also encouraged to develop energy-positive designs for real building projects across the country and around the world.</p>
