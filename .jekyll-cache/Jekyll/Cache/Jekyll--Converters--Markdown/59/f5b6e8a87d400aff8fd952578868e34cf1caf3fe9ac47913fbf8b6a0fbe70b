I"E	<p>The submitted proposal should include the following:  &lt;ol&gt;   &lt;li&gt;A detailed description of the proposed algorithm/system and how it was derived.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;ol start="2"&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Rationale as to why the Solver believes that the proposed algorithm/system will work. Goodness of fit alone is not guaranteed an award. The Solver needs to explain their algorithm and the reasoning behind it based on sound principles. The Solver should address each of the Solution Requirements described in the Detailed Description.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;ol start="3"&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Demonstration – The Solver should show the goodness of fit using the given data and demonstrate the algorithm works.  The algorithm should correctly identify the spectra as the mixture component rather than the pure components at least 95% of the time.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;ol start="4"&gt;   &lt;li&gt;The Algorithm itself should be delivered in a file format readable by the Seeker. This could be done by delivering the source code or an executable file. If necessary, instructions should be provided on how to run the solution.  Permitted programming languages are C, C++, C#, Java, MatLab, and Python.  The Seeker is flexible in the regard, and other languages may be acceptable with prior acceptance by the Seeker. If the Seeker cannot read the format, the submission will not be evaluated or awarded.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  The proposal <u>should not</u> include any personal identifying information (name, username, company, address, phone, email, personal website, resume, etc.)    This Challenge will be awarded based on deliverables. For an algorithm that can meet the requirements the award amount is <strong>$25,000</strong>.    The award is contingent upon theoretical evaluation and experimental validation of the submitted Solution by the Seeker. The algorithms will be tested on the Seeker’s data of known mixtures.    To receive an award, the Solvers will have to transfer to the Seeker their <em>exclusive Intellectual Property (IP) rights</em> to the solution. The Seeker is willing, in return, to grant a license to the Solver so they can continue to use the solution.  <em>However, the Seeker will be willing to consider a licensing agreement for a partial award, if exclusive IP cannot be granted by the Solver. </em></p>
