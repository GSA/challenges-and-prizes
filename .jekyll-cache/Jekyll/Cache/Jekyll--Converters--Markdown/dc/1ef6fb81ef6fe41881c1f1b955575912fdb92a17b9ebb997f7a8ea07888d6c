I"}<p>The National Operations Center of Excellence (NOCoE) and the U.S. DOT ITS JPO PCB program announce a competition for students to work directly with state and local DOTs to solve real-world transportation problems utilizing ITS and TSMO solutions.    Student teams will assemble and work with a local or state agency to define a problem or challenge in their region, or choose to address one of the sample problems outlined below. After submitting an initial contest application identify the team and the problem or challenge, students will work with academic advisors to learn about potential ITS and TSMO solutions via online training programs outlined below. Teams will then utilize their experience, education, and new coursework to develop a solution or suite of solutions to directly address the originally defined problem. Students will submit their solutions via a proposal. Finalist teams will develop a presentation and then will be flown to the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) 2018 Annual Meeting in Minneapolis to give a live presentation in front of a panel of judges made up of leaders in the ITS and TSMO community.</p>
