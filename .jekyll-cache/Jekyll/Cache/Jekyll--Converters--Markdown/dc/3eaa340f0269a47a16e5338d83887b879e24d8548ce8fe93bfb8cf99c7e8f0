I"Ä<p style="color: #555555;">The second annual HUD Innovation in Affordable Housing Student Design and Planning Competition challenges multi-disciplinary, graduate student teams to respond to a real life affordable housing design and planning issue. The competition is sponsored by HUDâ€™s Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&amp;R).</p>
<p style="color: #555555;">Multidisciplinary teams must be comprised of a minimum of three students and a maximum of five, plus one faculty advisor. Each team must have members representing three different graduate level programs; one of which must be from an architectural or design-related program, and one of which must be from a non-architectural program. There are many acceptable permutations; here is oneÂ <strong>example</strong>Â for clarity:</p>

Planning or Public Policy candidate&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;2 MBA candidates&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;h4 style="color: #2f2b29;"&gt;Goals&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;ul style="color: #555555;" type="disc"&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Encourage research and innovation to create high-quality affordable housing that strengthens the social and physical fabric of low- and moderate-income communities and neighborhoods.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Raise practitioner and future practitioner capacity to produce more livable and sustainable housing for low- and moderate-income people.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Foster cross-cutting team-work within the design and community development process.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;
