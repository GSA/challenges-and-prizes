  <li>25% of the prize purse will be awarded to the winner of this pitch competition to describe a formulation for a high-energy endothermic fuel using novel molecules that the team identifies and to describe the biosynthetic approach to generate this fuel.</li>
  <li>25% of the prize purse will be awarded to create a 500 mL sample of the biofuel to AFRL for testing. The properties of the biofuel must be determined as delineated in the ‚ÄúSolution Requirements‚Äù section.</li>
  <li>25% of the prize purse will be provided to proposers if the properties of the proposed biofuels are sufficient, as determined by AFRL, to proceed to manufacture at least 4L of the biofuel and provide a cost analysis comparing the biosynthetic path to traditional methods along with a scale-up plan to generate 10,000-100,000 gallons of biofuel.</li>
  <li>25% of the prize purse will be awarded upon delivery of the 4L of biofuel and the scale-up plan.</li>
