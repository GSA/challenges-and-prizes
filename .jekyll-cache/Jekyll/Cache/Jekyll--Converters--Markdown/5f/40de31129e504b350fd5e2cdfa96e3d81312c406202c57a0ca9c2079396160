I"\<p>This challenge seeks ideas for how you would partner with the federal government to make a meaningful impact on the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. Proposals may include innovation, enhanced infrastructure, or a solution for a hot topic issue to achieve effective outcomes during a focused amount of time (e.g. one year) on a project of choice. The White House Initiative on AAPIs is calling for submissions on great ideas to work in partnership with the federal government to expand opportunities for the AAPI community.</p>

<p>    <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">America is home to 18.2 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) who are part of diverse communities with diverse needs. They speak numerous languages, represent several cultures, and all are part of America.&lt;/p&gt;<p>It’s a time of extraordinary growth for the AAPI community. The AAPI population is on the rise in every region of the country. In fact, the population has increased by nearly 50% in just 10 years. The White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (WHIAAPI or Initiative) is working with local leaders to provide the necessary tools for communities to keep up with this growth. WHIAAPI is also helping AAPIs realize the potential of an America built through shared prosperity and equal opportunity. We’re helping to build new government connections with the AAPI community on national and regional levels. </p><p>At the heart of this work is the desire for AAPIs to work across cultures and sectors to establish effective local services, and ultimately achieve prosperity nationwide.&lt;/span&gt;    <i>Expanding Opportunity for AAPIs: WHIAAPI Proposal Challenge</i> is based on these principals and seeks to generate fresh ideas to expand the mission and work of the Initiative through ideas for potential partnerships.</p><p>Over the past three years, the Initiative has connected with diverse AAPI communities across the country. The Initiative has hosted more than 200 roundtables, stakeholder meetings and summits in 25 states, the District of Columbia and the Pacific Islands, reaching more than 30,000 individuals. Recent community engagement efforts have focused on emerging AAPI communities—targeting AAPIs in regions of the country that have experienced explosive growth over the past ten years. The Initiative has built upon those conversations with better-informed AAPI communities and federal agencies working together to address unique health, education, civil rights, economic and community development issues and cross-cutting policy areas including language access, data disaggregation, workforce diversity, and capacity building.</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The Initiative’s work has thrived on past partnerships with community-based organizations (CBOs) to implement Executive Order 13515, which reestablished the Initiative on October 14, 2009. Some examples of this collaborative work include:</span>  <ul>   <li>Parterning with AAPI professional development CBOs to conduct leadership roundtable series and summits;</li>   <li>Collaborating with AAPI health CBOs to present information on topical issues such as the HIV epidemic and conducting webinars and disseminating guidance;</li>   <li>Hosting the <i>iCount: Equity Through Representation</i> Symposium on data disaggregation with the National Commission on Asian American and Pacific Islander Research in Education and other CBOs;</li>   <li>Connecting with other Federal Agencies to provide technical assistance webinars on <a title="AANAPISI video link" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNeOn7Yb4ZQ&amp;list=UUBDnqUbZI2JstkwiTqqJguA&amp;feature=c4-overview" target="_blank">Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institutions (AANAPISI)</a>; and</li>   <li>Establishing a mentorship series for young professionals.</li>  </ul></p><p> The success of past partnerships has encouraged the Initiative to seek <b>new partnerships.</b> The Initiative invites proposals from <em>entities who have never partnered with the Initiative</em>, as well as <em>existing partners that have new proposals.</em>  These new partnerships will thrive on  the innovations proposed by the partner while also maintaining a focus on the Initiative’s current work on issues such as: immigration, health, health care, education, and workforce development.</p>
