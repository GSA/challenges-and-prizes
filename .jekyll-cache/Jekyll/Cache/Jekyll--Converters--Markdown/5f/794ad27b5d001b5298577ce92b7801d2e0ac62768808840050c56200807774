I"¯<p><span lang="EN">In this Challenge, we are seeking insightful essays from U.S. high school students, aged 16 &ndash; 18, that describe a teen&rsquo;s understanding of a specific mental health issue and ideas that can promote better health and well-being in their communities with a particular emphasis on communicating with parents, peers, school leaders, policy makers, and health professionals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Based on diagnostic interview data from the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A) the lifetime prevalence of any mental disorders among U.S. adolescents aged 15-16 and 17-18 is 49.3% and 56.7% respectively and an estimated 49.5% of adolescents had some type of mental disorder, with 22.2% having severe impairment.&nbsp; Pairing this data with the relatively low percentage (51.5%) of young adults aged 18 -25, with any mental disorder who received treatment---compared to adults aged 26-49, 66.1%, and older adults aged 50 and older, 71.5%---it is clear we need to understand mental health stigma and the cultural barriers adolescents from different cultures face when seeking mental health treatment.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml#part_155771">https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml#part_155771</a></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">According to the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the Department of Health and Human Services, in 2016 suicide was the second leading cause of death for youths aged 15 to 24, with 5,723 deaths (17.6%).&nbsp; Suicide for Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) youths in this age group had the largest percentage, 30.8%, with 316 deaths in 2016.&nbsp; This data, and other statistics, can be found at <a href="https://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/leadcause.html">https://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/leadcause.html</a> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The challenge of raising mental health awareness among AAPI communities is multifaceted but includes two key barriers: language issues and cultural barriers.&nbsp; To address these barriers, the Healthy Mind Initiative <a href="https://nimhd.blogs.govdelivery.com/2018/07/16/healthy-mind-initiative-an-innovative-model-to-address-emerging-mental-health-needs-among-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-youth/">https://nimhd.blogs.govdelivery.com/2018/07/16/healthy-mind-initiative-an-innovative-model-to-address-emerging-mental-health-needs-among-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-youth/</a> was established to create a collaboration across the federal, state, county, and community sectors with two intents. The first aim is to improve mental health literacy in AAPI communities. The second aim is to address the mental health stigma and cultural barriers to seeking mental health treatment faced by AAPI youth and communities. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The <em>Speaking Up About Mental Health!&nbsp; This Is My Story</em> Challenge was initiated to address this second aim and then further expanded to include any youth from any culture that may view mental health negatively or not at all due to stigma, lack of awareness and education, and differences in cultural conceptualization of mental health.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Solutions submitted to this Challenge could include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Creative ideas to start a conversation</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Innovative ideas to remove/reduce/lower barriers</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Suggested changes in school policies</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Other areas of concern to individuals and their community</span></li>

<p><strong><span lang="EN">Background:</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN">This Challenge builds from the Health Mind Initiative. The founding members of the Healthy Mind Initiative include the U.S. Public Health Service Asian Pacific American Officers Committee as lead, working with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Montgomery County, Maryland, Department of Health and Human Service&rsquo;s Asian American Health Initiative, and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the Calvin J. Li Memorial Foundation (CJL) have joined some of the original partners in the Healthy Mind Initiative to promote the Challenge and are not limiting the Challenge to AAPI communities but are opening the Challenge to all high school youths nationwide.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The NIMH is a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), an agency of the United States Government, and is authorized and established to conduct and support biomedical and behavioral research, health services research, research training, and health information dissemination with respect to the cause, diagnosis, treatment, control and prevention of mental illness.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The NIMHD is also a component of the NIH and is authorized and established to conduct and support research, training, dissemination of information, and other programs with respect to minority health conditions and other populations with health disparities.</span></p>
