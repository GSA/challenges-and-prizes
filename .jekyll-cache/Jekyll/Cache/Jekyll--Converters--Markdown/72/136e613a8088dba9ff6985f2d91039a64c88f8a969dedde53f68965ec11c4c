I"b<p>Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), is excited to launch the Master phase of the Multi-View Stereo 3D Mapping Challenge and wants you to participate!Â  In this challenge, solvers will be asked to generate and submit an algorithm to convert high-resolution satellite images to 3D point clouds for the contest datasets.    By harnessing the energy and expertise of the crowd, this Challenge aims to:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Promote and benchmark research in multiple view stereo algorithms applied to satellite imagery.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Stimulate various communities to develop and enhance automated methods to derive accurate 3D point clouds from multi-view satellite imagery, including computer vision, remote sensing and photogrammetry.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Foster innovation through crowdsourcing and moving beyond current research limitations for 3D point clouds.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Cultivate and sustain an ongoing collaborative community dedicated to this technology and research.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;</p>
