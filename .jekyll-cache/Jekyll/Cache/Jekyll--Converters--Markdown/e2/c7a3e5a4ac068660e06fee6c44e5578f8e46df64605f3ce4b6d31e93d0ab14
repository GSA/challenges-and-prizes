  <li>Ability and/or plan of the program to address racial/ethnic disparities impacting womenâ€™s understanding of EDCs and their associated exposure risk: (25%)</li>
  <li>Ability of the program to apply evidence-based interventions to reduce knowledge gaps and provide populations served resources and solutions to reduce EDC exposure risk(s), where that program could be or is already applied to Black or African American women: (30%)</li>
  <li>How the program is innovative at targeting knowledge gaps and providing populations served with resources and solutions to reduce EDC exposure risk(s): (20%)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Phase 2 Scoring Criteria (Awarding programs with demonstrated effectiveness)</strong></p>

<p>All Criteria are scaled 1-10, with 1 being the lowest score on each dimension and 10 being the highest score on each dimension. Scores are weighted by the proportion of each dimension and then aggregated to create a final score. Judging criteria for Phase 2 include (Total Points 100%):</p>
