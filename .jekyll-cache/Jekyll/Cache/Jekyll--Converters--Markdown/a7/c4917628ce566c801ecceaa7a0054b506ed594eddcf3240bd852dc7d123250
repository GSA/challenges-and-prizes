I"ö<p>In June, 2019, the U.S. Department of Energy Water Power Technologies Office launched a prize to develop wave energy powered desalination systems. The Waves to Water Prize is a 4-Stage, $2.5M contest to accelerate the development of small, modular, wave-powered desalination systems capable of providing potable drinking water in disaster relief scenarios and remote coastal locations.</p>

<p>This is the second stage of this prize, the DESIGN Stage, which offers competitors up to $800,000 in cash prizes. This DESIGN Stage asks competitors to submit a plan and provide detailed modeling of the system.</p>

<p>The Prize aims to attract dedicated teams of highly capable individuals and provide them with sufficient incentives so that they will advance their technologies through completion of the prize. While the technology development goals of the prize are specifically tailored to address the unique circumstances around disaster response or remote coastal community water needs, the purpose is also to advance technologies that could have broader applications for wave energy and desalination technologies. Through the competition, participants will develop skills and knowledge that will contribute to a general improvement and proliferation of wave power and desalination technologies.</p>
