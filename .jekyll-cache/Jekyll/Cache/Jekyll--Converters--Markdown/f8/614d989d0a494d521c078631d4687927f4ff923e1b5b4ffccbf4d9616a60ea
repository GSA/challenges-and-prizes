<!--more-->

<p>Entrants of the HA-VTE Prevention Challenge will be asked to describe the VTE prevention strategy and reasons that support the strategy choice developed by their organization. In addition, entrants will be asked to describe the specific intervention(s) (e.g. implementation of VTE protocols and order sets, risk assessment, electronic alerts, clinical decision support tools, performance monitoring systems and dashboards, patient and/or provider education and awareness, post-discharge follow-up, etc.), methods, and systems used to implement, support and evaluate the strategy. Entrants will be asked to submit at least one quantitative measure showing an increase of VTE prevention (e.g. # of patients assessed for VTE risk, # of at risk patients receiving appropriate VTE prevention, # of patients and/or providers receiving education on VTE prevention, etc.) and/or decrease in HA-VTE rates for the organization’s population of interest. Each measure submitted must include two data points: one for the control or pre-intervention period and a second for the post-intervention period. Control/pre-intervention and post-intervention measures must cover a period of at least six months.</p>

<p>The VTE prevention rates achieved should be for the organizations entire patient population observed as outlined in their strategy and intervention methods, not limited to a sample. Data on subpopulations is allowed, but must be inclusive of all patients seen during the stated time period of study. Examples of ineligible data submissions include VTE prevention interventions limited to treatment cohorts from clinical trials of novel anticoagulant drugs.</p>

<p>The estimated burden for completing the nomination form is 30 minutes to 1 hour.</p>
