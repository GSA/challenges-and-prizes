I"Ä<p><strong>Challenge Summary</strong></p>

<p>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), announces its Decoding Maternal Morbidity Data Challenge to help advance research on maternal health and promote healthy pregnancies. The Challenge goal is to devise new ways of analyzing the large dataset from its Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) to identify factors that impact maternal morbidity and severe maternal morbidity so that clinicians can more quickly and accurately identify and treat pregnancy-related conditions and prevent severe illness or death for a pregnant person. The total purse for the Challenge is $400,000.</p>

<p><strong>Subject of the Challenge</strong></p>

<p>Each year in the United States, more than 50,000 women experience severe maternal morbidity (SMM), unexpected outcomes of labor and delivery that result in significant short- or long-term health consequences, and many more experience maternal morbidity (MM), unexpected outcomes of labor and delivery that affect womenâ€™s health but are less significant. In addition, the United States has the highest ratio of maternal mortality among developed nations; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, as of 2019 there were 16.7 deaths per 100,000 live births, a number that has been increasing since the surveillance began in 1987. Large disparities exist based on race/ethnicity and other factors.</p>

<p>The <em>Eunice Kennedy Shriver</em> National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) mission is to lead research and training to understand human development, improve reproductive health, enhance the lives of children and adolescents, and optimize abilities for all. In support of this mission, NICHD conducted the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) to study nulliparous women, those for whom this pregnancy would lead to their first delivery. Potential adverse pregnancy outcomes among these women are less predictable because they have not given birth before and no prior data on how they respond to pregnancy is available. NuMoM2b began in 2010 and compiled data on more than 10,000 racially, ethnically, and geographically diverse participants. Data collection began in the 6th week of pregnancy and continued through delivery. Collected data include interviews, questionnaires, clinical measurements, patient charts, and biological specimens.</p>

<p>Through the Decoding Maternal Morbidity Data Challenge, NICHD seeks innovative approaches to identify new areas of research on SMM and MM from the nuMoM2b dataset. NICHD invites scientists and teams of scientists to use novel computational analysis, data mining, or unique learning approaches on the data to identify factors that impact SMM and MM so that clinicians can more quickly and accurately diagnose and treat pregnancy-related conditions and prevent severe illness and death among pregnant people.</p>
