<p>While most children with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, healthcare providers have difficulty determining which of their pediatric patients will progress to moderate or severe COVID-19 early in the progression. Some of these patients develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a life-threatening inflammation of organs and tissues. Methods to distinguish children at risk for severe COVID-19 complications, including conditions such as MIS-C are needed for earlier interventions to improve pediatric patient outcomes.</p>

<p>Multiple HHS divisions are coming together for a data challenge competition that will leverage de-identified electronic health record data to develop, train and validate computational models that can predict severe COVID-19 complications in children, equipping healthcare providers with the information and tools they need to identify pediatric patients at risk.</p>

<p>The challenge  is sponsored by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, in partnership with two institutes from the National Institutes of Health ‚Äì the National Institute of Health‚Äôs National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) ‚Äì along with the Health Resources and Services Administration‚Äôs (HRSA) Maternal and Child Health Bureau. The challenge will be administered by Sage Bionetworks.</p>

<p>Challenge participants will be asked to develop, train, and validate computational models to predict pediatric patients at risk for hospitalization, need for ventilation, and cardiovascular interventions, utilizing de-identified electronic health record data available through NCATS‚Äô National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) Data Enclave. The N3C Data Enclave is a central, harmonized data repository that represents electronic health records from over 55 health centers across the U.S. To protect patient privacy, de-identified data provides information useful to researchers without revealing any information that could identify individual patients.</p>

<p>BARDA is part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

  <li>Participants must also agree to assume any and all risks and waive claims against the federal government, technical reviewers, challenge administrators and its related entities, except in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue, or profits, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising from participation in this prize contest, whether the injury, death, damage, or loss arises through negligence or otherwise.</li>
  <li>Participants are not required to obtain liability insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility in any specified amount for claims by a third party for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss resulting from an activity carried out in connection with participation in a prize competition, but participants are encouraged to consult with their advisors with respect to the level of insurance that is prudent for each participant.</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>Intellectual Property (IP) Rights</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Participants should be aware that any agreement signed or obligation undertaken in regard to their participation in this prize competition that conflicts with the prize competition rules, terms, and conditions may result in disqualification of the participant‚Äôs submission.</li>
  <li>By participating in this prize competition, each participant (whether participating singly or in a group) warrants that he or she is the sole author or owner of, or has the right to use, any copyrightable works that the submission comprises, that the works are wholly original with the participant (or are an improved version of an existing work that the participant has sufficient rights to use and improve), and that the submission does not infringe any copyright or any other rights of any third party of which the participant is aware. Each participant will retain all other intellectual property rights in their submissions, as applicable. To participate in the prize competition, each participant must warrant that there are no legal obstacles to providing the above-referenced nonexclusive licenses of participant rights to the federal government. To receive an award, winners will retain ownership of their intellectual property rights in the solution but must grant to the federal government the nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice, or have practiced for or on its behalf, the solution throughout the world for federal purposes.</li>

<h1 id="judging-criteria">Judging Criteria</h1>

<p><strong>Judging Panel</strong></p>

<p>Technical reviewers with expertise relevant to the Challenge will evaluate the solutions based on their ability to achieve the criteria listed below. Technical reviewers will be comprised of experts sourced from the Federal government, academia, industry, and other sectors as deemed relevant. The solutions and evaluation information from the technical reviewers will then be reviewed by federal employees serving as judges, who will select up to 3 challenge winners, as well as any honorable mentions subject to the final decision by the Award Approving Official.</p>

<p>The award approving official will be the BARDA director.</p>

<p><strong>Evaluation Metrics</strong></p>

<p>Each submission will be evaluated along quantitative and qualitative metrics.</p>

<p><strong>Quantitative Metrics</strong></p>

<p>Participants in this challenge will build models on a training dataset established by challenge organizers. Those trained models will then be tested on a holdout set to establish initial model performance. Models will then be put through a ‚Äúfinal training‚Äù. The primary metrics used to score models will be the FŒ≤ metric, followed by the Area Under the Precision Recall Curve and the Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve. The AUROC will be used to evaluate model generalizability, where models will be evaluated for temporal, cross-site, and demographic generalizability.</p>

<p><strong>Qualitative Metrics</strong></p>

<p>Qualitative metrics of utility and reproducibility will also be used as part of the final ranking of the submissions. Factors related to model utility include (1) feature interpretation (Can the factors driving individual predictions be understood or is the model a black box?), (2) method clarity (Are the code, documentation, and final submission write up understandable and clear?), (3) timeliness of predictions (are models able to make accurate predictions before an intervention needs to happen), and (4) context utility (can a model still make accurate predictions in the setting in which it will be used?). Factors related to reproducibility include (1) technical reproducibility (Can the code be deployed and re-run successfully under different computational conditions?), (2) prediction reproducibility (Does the model make the same predictions each time under the same conditions?), and (3) documentation reproducibility (Is there sufficient documentation to replicate the model?).</p>

<p><strong>Judging Criteria</strong></p>

<p>The above metrics will become part of a ranking consensus for the submissions in each of the challenge questions. The primary purpose of this challenge is to identify the most clinically useful predictions models for pediatric severity of COVID-19. The judges will use both the quantitative metrics and the qualitative metrics to identify the models submitted to each question that are most likely to be clinically useful.</p>
