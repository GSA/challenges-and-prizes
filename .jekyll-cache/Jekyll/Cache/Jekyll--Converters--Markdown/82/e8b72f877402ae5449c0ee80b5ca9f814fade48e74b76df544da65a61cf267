I"F<h4>Background</h4>
<p><strong>Create algorithms (methods, processes and/or tools) for identifying redundancies, gaps, conflicts, and interactions among care-plan items and other data.</strong>   <p></p> Veterans receiving health care benefits at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) interact with clinicians of multiple specialties and professions inside and outside VA. VA desires that each Veteran have a single authoritative plan of care that is shared among all treating clinicians and that facilitates outcomes important to the Veteran. Such a plan of care will help VA deliver on its triple aim of improving the Veteranâ€™s experience, population health, and efficiency. VA is currently modernizing its electronic health record (EHR) systems to support more modern models that depend on a clear plan of care shared by all members of the care team. This EHR will use a range of structured data including natural language, template free-text, semi-structured, structured but not standardized, and standardized community terminologies. <p></p>VA will use LOINC for laboratory results, RxNorm for medications, and SNOMed for health conditions, and clinical observations. Other standards may also be used for occupational history and roles. In addition to traditional EHR data, the new EHR will allow clinicians and patients to specify goals of care and preferences among goals. VA will pursue acquisition of ontologies and knowledge bases that specify associations among interventions, observations, conditions, and goals. VA will also acquire clinical decision support capabilities to include rule and workflow services that may process algorithms in real time. It will also have analytical platforms optimized for cross-patient data analyses using statistical and other types of software for finding and characterizing associations. This platform will also support natural language processing.  <h4>Description</h4>  This challenge seeks algorithms (methods, processes and/or tools) for identifying redundancies, gaps, conflicts, and interactions among care-plan items and other data. The solutions would be part of an electronic health record used by clinicians or patients. For this challenge, VA is not interested in re-creating a system for interactions among drugs (both over the counter and prescription).  <p></p>  The solutions should focus on at least one of the following health concerns: mental health, chronic pain, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease as well as address how proposed methods would scale to other health concerns. The solutions should address redundancies and conflicts among care-plan items. VA encourages solutions to address at least one of the other issues: gaps, facilitating interactions, and impeding interactions. The solutions should address the following care plan items: medications, laboratory-test orders. Goals or parameters for treatment, home-health nursing care plans, inpatient nursing care plans, physical therapy/exercise regimens, and counseling regimens should also be considered. Methods should account  <h4>Timeline</h4>  <ul>   <li>Registration Opens : April 28, 2015</li>   <li>Phase I Deadline: July 13, 2015</li>   <li>Phase II Launch: August 10, 2015</li>   <li>Phase II Deadline: November 2, 2015</li>   <li>Evaluation Period Begins: November 6, 2015</li>   <li>Announcement of Winners: Early December</li>  </ul>  <h4>Evaluation Criteria</h4>  The Challenge requires a solution that identifies treatment redundancies and interactions encompassing multiple providers, patient behaviors and prescriptions. Evaluation criteria for judging will include:  <ul>   <li>Potential to resolve care coordination issues and integrate data from the VA as well as external sources (50%)</li>   <li>How well the methods scale to produce content (algorithms) for various use cases (25%)</li>   <li>Potential and realistic plans for adoption (15%)</li>   <li>Innovative and elegant (10%)</li>  </ul>  <h4>Submission Requirements</h4>  The challenge will take place in two phases. Phase I will require teams to submit a written description of the proposed solution, while phase II will require working prototypes. The submission requirements for each phase must include (but not limited to):    Phase I:  <ul>   <li>A written description (up to 3 pages) describing the algorithms (methods, processes and/or tools) to identify redundancies, gaps, conflicts, and interactions among care-plans, what data is necessary and how you would incorporate these data</li>   <li>A slide deck with illustrations of how the algorithms would be used (no more than 10 slides)</li>  </ul>  Phase II:  <ul>   <li>All of the above</li>   <li>Link to working application</li>   <li><a href="http://www.health4con.com/devchallenge/files/KeyTerms-Final.pdf">Key Terms PDF</a></li>   <li><a href="http://www.osehra.org/content/foia-vista">FOIA VistA Source Code Download Site</a></li>   <li><a href="http://www.osehra.org/content/va-enterprise-vista-standard">VA Enterprise VistA</a></li>   <li><a href="http://www.osehra.org/content/distributions-vista">Distributions of VistA</a></li>   <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B96qyeYPeArXaElTRXlIckdvWkE/view?usp=sharing">Vista Data Dictionary</a></li>   <li><a href="https://www.myvehucampus.com/">MyVeHU - create free account and view presentation "15028 VistA Evolution: eHMP &amp; JLV" </a></li>   <li><a href="http://vaftl.us/">Department of Veterans Affairs Innovations Future Technology Laboratory</a></li>  </ul>  <h4>Resources</h4>  <h4>Media Collateral</h4>  <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/health4dev/care-coordination-webinar-4">VA Care Coordination for Improved Outcomes Challenge</a> </strong>from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/health4dev">health4dev</a></strong>    Informational webinar to learn more about the challenge and questions answered by the VA.    <a href="https://vimeo.com/128194529">2015-05-18 14.02 VA Care Coordination for Improved Outcomes Challenge Webinar</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/health40">Health 2.0</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.
