I"C*<p><strong>Solutions must show publication-quality data demonstrating:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A 3-D human retina organoid system that mimics the physiological and morphological features of the in vivo biology, consists of the major retina cell types (rod and cone photoreceptors, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells and Muller glia) with appropriate lamination and synaptic organization, and represents their biological functions and interplay. Components (neurons, retinal pigment epithelium [RPE], glia) may be produced separately or dissociated and recombined (1) if protocol addresses a significant biological or technical hurdle and (2) if in the process of re-assembly, specific functions/roles of cell types are delineated. Three-dimensional assembly may be achieved using various approaches, for example through self-organization that recapitulates natural development or through bioengineering with scaffolds, bioprinting, and/or microfluidic apparatuses.</li>
  <li>Retina organoids that are generated entirely from human cells (e.g. derived from iPSCs, hESCs, multipotent cells, or adult cells subjected to a combination of transdifferentiation and/or reprogramming methods).</li>
  <li>A 3D human retina organoid system that either 1) can be used for modeling and treating retinal disease; or 2) can be used for testing and developing drug (i.e., high content screening) therapies (for details, see Evaluation Criteria 4 below).</li>
</ul>

<p>Explants are not of interest for this Challenge. Tissue-on-a-chip systems that use cells grown in 2-D co-culture and do not fully represent the structure, morphology, and function of the human retina are also not of interest. However, creative approaches that incorporate use of microfluidics or perfusion to enhance culture or extend duration of survival for 3-D organoid systems are acceptable.</p>

<p>In general to the four review categories, reviewers will be asked to focus on the following areas. Each submission can earn a total of 100 points.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Significant advances over currently available protocols in areas such as duration of culture, yield, and maturity/differentiation of all cell types in appropriate numbers and ratio.</li>
  <li>Potential impact on understanding the biology of the retina.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Evaluation Criterion 1 - Impact and Innovation (20 points)</strong></p>

<p>Submissions will be evaluated according to the impact it has on potential end users, clinical implications, and therapeutic advances.  Solutions presented should have a sustained, powerful influence on the understanding of retinal diseases and accelerating research toward new therapies.  Data should demonstrate feasible methods and technology to generate retina organoids with maximum relevance to human physiology and disease.  Submissions should address significant physiological barriers to the field (e.g. vasculature, additional cell types, fovea, etc.). Solutions should overcome significant technological barriers of human retina organoid development (e.g. speed up organoid differentiation/maturation, improve yield, or increase reproducibility).
