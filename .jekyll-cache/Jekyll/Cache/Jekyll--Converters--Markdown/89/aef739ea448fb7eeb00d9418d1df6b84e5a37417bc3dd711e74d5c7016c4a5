<h4 id="general-overview">General Overview</h4>

<p>Project Overmatch has established methods, tools, and integrated rapid innovation laboratory (iRIL) environments for the continuous exploration of emerging technologies that will advance the reach, capacity, and resiliency of maritime tactical network of networks. The NetANTX Challenge, hereinafter referred to as the “Challenge”, is focused on quickly identifying operationally relevant innovations and emerging networking technologies, which are critical to retaining and progressing Naval overmatch in the maritime domain. Selected participants will be invited to demonstrate candidate technologies in an integrated rapid innovation laboratory (iRIL), which is a simulation-based environment (SBE) that will employ tactically-relevant scenarios in operationally-relevant conditions. The iRIL and assessment criteria will focus on technologies that contribute specifically to the Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) network layer or layer 3. The OSI model defines the functionality of the network layer as structuring and managing multi-node network, including addressing, routing, and traffic engineering (https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.220-198811-S/en). Solutions are expected to run on a Linux (Centos7) platform, with potentially multiple Ethernet interfaces. Solutions are expected to control how application packets are forwarded, queued or dropped on a per-packet or per-flow basis. Technologies that operate above layer 3 (e.g. Application layer routing protcols), but manipulate the routing tables or capture and redirect traffic to interfaces are within scope. Solutions that leverage Software Defined Networking (SDN) technologies or Mobile Ad-hoc Networking (MANET) solutions are both encouraged.</p>

<p>Future prize challenges will focus on the other OSI layers (application through physical layers) and/or technology areas which include, but are not limited to: modern software development pipelines and infrastructure, underlying data architectures, and rapid deployment of automation, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) into tactical applications both afloat and ashore.</p>

<h4 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h4>

<p>Consider a scenario where the Naval Force is operating in a highly contested environment and most communication paths are denied. In this scenario, only a few modes and links that operate at low kilobit per second data rates and below. Such a network is characterized by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sparsely connected nodes</li>
  <li>multi-hop needed to support end-to-end application flows</li>
  <li>low kilobit per second data rate links</li>
  <li>dynamic and unpredictable connectivity based on locations and radio frequency (RF) channel effects</li>
  <li>network demand exceeds available network resources</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the above conditions poses a significant challenge to network operation. Yet, the Navy must operate under the combined effects of all the above conditions. The Networks Prize Challenge, hereinafter referred to as the “Challenge”, seeks innovative technologies that will maximize the utility of this very limited network, specifically by enabling efficient, low-overhead routing of application packets.</p>
