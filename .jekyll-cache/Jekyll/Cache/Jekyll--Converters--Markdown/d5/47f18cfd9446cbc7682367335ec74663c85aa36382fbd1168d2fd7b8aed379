I"Ñ<p><strong><u>Background</u></strong>    Raman spectroscopy is commonly utilized in the field for the identification of bulk powders due to its reliability and high specificity; however, this specificity poses a problem when the unknown bulk powder is a mixture. Each mixture produces unique spectra at different concentrations (non-linear) and current algorithms or systems are not proficient at identifying mixtures based on the pure components recorded in its library. In the field of explosive detection, this poses a problem when dealing with homemade explosives (HMEs) especially oxidizer/fuel mixtures. Vendors have attempted to address this issue with their Raman systems; however, they have not yet found a robust solution.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Challenge</u></strong>    From this Challenge we ideally seek to receive an algorithm that can be translated into a software update for any commercial Raman system in the field. This solution will allow the system to better identify mixtures and preferably be able to calculate the ratio of the components in a 2 component mixture.    Solvers are challenged to come up with an algorithm that can identify the referenced 2 component mixtures by utilizing the spectra for the individual pure components in the library and not a library of mixture spectra. The algorithm should still identify pure components correctly.Â  In addition, it would be nice to have their relative concentrations from the Raman spectra, but it is not absolutely required as some assumptions about ratios can be made.</p>
<p>Typically for oxidizer and fuel mixtures the Raman signal is dominated by the oxidizer signal. The identification of a mixture with both fuel and oxidizer requires identification of the fuel component.</p>
<p>Solvers are not obligated to use this approach, but a potential solution could include saturating the oxidizer signal and running an algorithm to identify the smaller return from the fuel component, while ignoring the saturated peaks.</p>
