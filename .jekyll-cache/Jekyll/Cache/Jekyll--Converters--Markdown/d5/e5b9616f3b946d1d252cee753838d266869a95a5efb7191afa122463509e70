I"@<p>While single-purpose “gray” stormwater infrastructure (e.g., catch basins, pipes, and ponds) is largely designed to move urban stormwater away from the built environment, green infrastructure uses vegetation and soil to manage rainwater close to where it falls. By weaving natural processes into the built environment, green infrastructure can provide not only stormwater management, but also heat island mitigation, air quality management, community amenities, and much more.    EPA invites student teams to design an innovative green infrastructure project for their campus to show how managing stormwater at its source can benefit the campus community and the environment. Student teams can compete in one of two design categories: the Master Plan category or the Demonstration Project category. This year, EPA will ask student teams to incorporate climate resiliency considerations into their stormwater management designs. To compete in EPA’s Campus RainWorks Challenge, registered teams must submit†one Project Narrative, two Design Boards, and one Letter of Support describing an innovative green infrastructure project for a location on their campus. Winning teams will earn a student prize to be divided evenly among student team members, as well as a faculty prize to support green infrastructure research or training.</p>
