I"Û<p>Registration has now¬†closed. ¬†If you would like to contact the Challenge Team with any questions, or to stay connected and follow the Challenge into Stage 2 and 3, please contact the team at <a href="mailto:N2NChallenge@iarpa.gov">N2NChallenge@iarpa.gov</a>.    Registration is different than what had been discussed at participants‚Äô day.¬† Participation is NOT a first come first served approach! ¬†All participants who submit a registration form by the March 17 progress to Stage 2.    The Nail to Nail (N2N) Fingerprint Challenge seeks to identify fingerprint collection solutions able to acquire nail-to-nail image capture of the friction ridge surface without the need of a human operator. Collection of N2N, or rolled, fingerprint images allows for improved recognition performance in live and forensic matching scenarios. Traditionally, fingerprints can be grouped into three types: plain (or slap), rolled (or nail-to-nail), and latent (i.e., those found at a crime scene which must be developed through dusting, fuming, or other techniques). Plain prints represent information from only the center portion of the finger pad, whereas rolled prints represent information around the entirety of the finger pad, from one nail edge all the way around to the other nail edge. Latent prints are those left behind on a surface when the person is no longer present. Latent prints are typically partial or degraded in quality, due to the nature of how they are left behind or imprinted, unwittingly, on an object‚Äôs surface.    In traditional matching scenarios where plain or rolled prints are compared against one another, the larger surface area translates into more discriminative information for matching. For forensic applications, the larger surface area in the reference image increases the likelihood of obtaining sufficient overlap when matching partial latent fingerprints. Plain prints are easy to collect and typically don‚Äôt require operator assistance to produce good quality images for matching. While N2N prints provide superior information for matching, they are more difficult to collect than plain and require physically rolling the finger across a flat surface, often requiring assistance from a human operator. Having an operator involved in the process constrains the feasibility of collecting rolled prints in a variety of environments and operational scenarios. Removing the human-in-the-loop from this process through advanced collection and processing techniques will allow better fingerprint data to be collected, leading to improved recognition performance, while reducing the time and cost of collection.  &lt;h4&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;  The goal of the N2N Fingerprint Challenge is to improve biometric fingerprint collection and recognition systems by eliminating plain fingerprint captures. This challenge seeks to identify solutions which can perform live capture of N2N fingerprints without requiring a human operator1 for the purposes of matching against other latent or live capture of fingerprints. This unassisted N2N collection will allow for more distinguishing data to be collected while also alleviating the time and cost associated with using human operators. The developed system should collect fingerprint data that performs as good as, or better than, existing operator controlled N2N fingerprint collection approaches. Performance of the developed N2N collection systems will be evaluated using data collected from a live test using human subjects and encompasses both live and latent fingerprints. The participant collected data will be compared against ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù N2N and latent data using conventional fingerprint recognition algorithms. Participants will be judged based on traditional biometric performance measures in addition to speed of the collection process. Participants are not required to develop algorithmic/software techniques to match N2N or latent data.    Participants are expected to design a system that will perform live capture of fully cooperative subjects. It is expected that subjects will be in close proximity to the device, as such, contactless or standoff systems are not required, but are still in scope if they meet the requirements for N2N collection. Systems may be facilitated by an observer, but the observer may not physically interact with the subject. Additionally, mechanical arms or other devices which ‚Äúroll‚Äù the finger as a human operator traditionally would are out of scope but other mechanical components may be allowed.    The N2N Challenge is a three-stage process: 1) registration and feasibility review 2) system build and judging, and 3) Live Test: evaluation of performance. <strong><em>Note: All submissions will be accepted through Challenge.gov only. </em></strong>    <strong>Review additional timeline and challenge resource material on the N2N<a href="http://iarpa.gov/challenges/n2n/n2n.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">¬†challenge information site</a></strong>. ¬†Contact the challenge team at <a href="mailto:N2NChallenge@iarpa.gov">N2NChallenge@iarpa.gov</a></p>
