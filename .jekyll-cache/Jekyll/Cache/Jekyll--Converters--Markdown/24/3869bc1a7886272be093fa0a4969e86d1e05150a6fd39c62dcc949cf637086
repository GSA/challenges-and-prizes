I"o<p>The Open Science Prize is a partnership between the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Wellcome Trust, with additional support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, to harness the power of open content and data to advance biomedical research and open science.    The Prize provides funding to encourage and support the prototyping and development of services, tools, or platforms that enable open content – including publications, datasets, codes and other research outputs – to be discovered, accessed, and re-used in ways that will advance discovery and spark innovation. It also aims to forge new international collaborations that bring together open science innovators to develop services and tools of benefit to the global research community.    The challenge consists of a two-phase competition. For Phase I, international teams will compete for funding to take new ideas for products or services to the prototype stage, or to further develop an existing early-stage prototype. Up to six prizes of $80,000 each will be awarded to successful teams to develop their innovation over an 8- to 9-month period. For Phase II, the Phase I prize recipient judged to have the prototype with the greatest potential to advance open science will receive a prize of $230,000.    <strong>Eligible teams must be a collaboration of a U.S. and an international partner.</strong></p>
