I"ö<p><b>PHASE 2</b></p>
<p>Phase 2 submitters can include any organization or collaboration that is able to widely spread the successful use of the tools recognized in Phase 1, and need not have participated in Phase 1. Success will likely require partnership with organizations that have significant size and reach - such as specialty societies, quality organizations, Regional Extension Centers (RECs), health IT products or services vendors - to support the tool dissemination goals. Submitters must demonstrate successful use of these tools in at least 2 additional practices.</p>

<p>To participate in Phase 2, provide documentation describing the elements below. Narrative elements must be no longer than 5 pages, not including screenshots, artifacts, or worksheets.</p>
<p>a. <b>CDS Tools Spread.</b> Describe which tools from Phase 1 your team spread to other practices using the format of the <b>Phase I CDS Intervention Details</b>. Describe in detail any modifications that were made to the Phase 1 version of the tools.</p>
<p>b. <b>Spread Results.</b>
<ul>
	<li>Successful implementations: Describe the number and nature of practices to which the CDS interventions were spread. For each practice, provide details as described in <b>Phase 1 Practice Information</b>.</li>
	<li>Blood pressure control and process improvements: For each practice and in the aggregate, describe the blood pressure control improvements generated by the tools using the instructions in <b>Phase 1 Blood Pressure Control Results</b>. If BP control improvements have not yet been achieved, provide compelling evidence of significant value to the practice(s) and their hypertensive patients from the tool implementation.</li>
	<li>Additional commitments: Provide evidence about any additional sites that have committed to adopt the CDS tools you are spreading but have not yet reached implementation.</li>
</ul>
c. <b>Spread Strategy.</b> Describe how you supported successful use of the CDS tools in practices. Provide enough detail, such as critical success factors and pitfalls to avoid, so that others could replicate it. See Phase 1 items CDS Support Overview and Blood Pressure Protocol, and Workflow Integration Details for guidance on providing details about protocol/CDS implementation details for individual sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>***Submit your solution by clicking the "Submit Solution" tab in the upper-right corner and following the instructions***</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>PHASE 1</b></p>
<p>A practice implementing the protocol must lead the submission. Practices are encouraged to form teams supporting their entry that include organizations such as a Regional Extension Center (REC), EHR developer, quality organization and/or professional society. Practices must demonstrate high blood pressure control levels and/or improvement to ensure that their tools and strategies merit replication across other practice settings.</p>
<p>To participate in Phase 1, provide documentation describing the elements below. Narrative elements must be no longer than 5 pages, not including screenshots, artifacts, or worksheets.</p>
<p><b>*** VIEW THE AUGUST 5 <a href="https://capconcorp.webex.com/capconcorp/lsr.php?RCID=6fe98e1917855df0751bdc8a0a63d2b0">WEBINAR RECORDING</a> (<a href="http://oncchallenges.ideascale.com/userimages/accounts/91/917467/EHR_Innovations_Challenge_Transcript.pdf">transcript</a>) ***</b></p>
<p>a. <b><a>Blood Pressure Control Results</a>.</b> Challenge entry requires exemplary blood pressure control for hypertensive patients driven by EHR/CDS interventions ‚Äì a practice-wide control rate of at least 70%, and/or a significantly improved level from before the enhanced CDS interventions described in the submission were deployed (no specific threshold must be met).
<ul>
	<li> Hypertension prevalence in practice: per cent of patients 18 or older whose diagnosis list includes hypertension.</li>
	<li> Per cent of patients with hypertension whose blood pressure is controlled (&lt;140/90). The specifications used to determine this rate must be the same as that used for PQRS #236/NQF #0018 (see the <a href="http://ushik.ahrq.gov/ViewItemDetails?system=mu&amp;itemKey=118811000">US Health Information Knowledgebase</a>). Significant improvement over time in BP control: Provide the percent of the patient population whose BP rate was improved over a specified period. Each submission will be evaluated based on the percent improvement and time period but no specific threshold for these must be met.</li>
	<li> Per cent of the patient population whose blood pressure rate was improved over a specified period, the per cent improvement, and the time period, using the specifications above for determining the rates.</li>
</ul>
b. <b><a href="http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/resources/protocols.html">Blood Pressure Protocol</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/CDS4MU">CDS Support Overview</a>.</b> Describe the CDS interventions and implementation strategies believed to have had the greatest effects on BP control. In a narrative, describe the protocol elements you addressed and how you used EHR and related CDS interventions to address them (we encourage but do not require that you address all five elements):
<ul>
	<li> BP measurement/recording (e.g., use of documentation templates, highlighting abnormal BPs in EHR)</li>
	<li> BP follow-up and patient recall (e.g., use of registry reports)</li>
	<li> Medication selection and titration (e.g., use of order sets)</li>
	<li> Patient engagement (e.g., use of patient education and goal setting tools, templates for documenting and responding to home BP readings, patient reminders for medications/appointments)</li>
	<li> Workup/referral for poor control (e.g., reference information, hypertension-specific consult order forms)</li>
</ul>
c. <b>CDS Intervention Details.</b> For each intervention used to implement the blood pressure protocol, provide a detailed description that includes, for example, categories and orders within an order set, data entry fields/options in a documentation template, rules used to produce data, and report layout for patient lists from registries. Screenshots are optional, and you may express the intervention using the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=337">HL7 CDS Knowledge Artifact Implementations (‚ÄúHealth eDecisions‚Äù) Draft Standard for Trial Use</a>. Only submit material for which widespread use is acceptable, without payment or limitation. DO NOT submit any propriety material without submitting all pertinent permissions (e.g., from EHR vendor) and DO NOT submit any <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/summary/">protected health information (PHI)</a>.</p>
<p>d. <b>Workflow Integration Details.</b> Describe how you integrated into the practice and clinical workflow the interventions described in the previous section. Provide enough detail so that other practices wanting to use the same interventions you have used would experience similar success with them in controlling blood pressure. Use both a narrative description and the CDS/Quality Improvement worksheets for standard presentation/replication (e.g., similar to QI case example within the <a href="http://bit.ly/CDS4MU">CDS/QI resources recently provided by ONC</a>; see specifically II.A: CHC Inc. and Ellsworth QI Case Studies).</p>
<p>e. <b>Practice Information.</b> Provide information about the lead practice as detailed in the "Practice Information" section in Rules.</p>
