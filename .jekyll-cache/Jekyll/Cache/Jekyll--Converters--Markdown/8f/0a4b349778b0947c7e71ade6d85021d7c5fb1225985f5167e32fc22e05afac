I"|<p><strong>Stage I, Ideation</strong></p>
<p>In Stage I, all Solvers participating in the Challenge will develop ideas for an analytical visualization tool. Five Stage I semi-finalists will be invited to Stage II as semi-finalists to develop their ideations into proofs of concept and compete for a cash prize. If a selectee declines to participate in the next stage, an alternate may be selected.</p>
<p><strong>Stage I semi-finalists:</strong></p>
<ul> <li><strong>Arity&nbsp;</strong>will incorporate algorithms using its connected vehicle and driver behavior data to explore the relationship between driving behavior and road design in order to improve highway safety.</li> <li><strong>Ford Motor Co.</strong> will combine traditional crash data with connected vehicle and driver behavior data derived from their research, social media, and population data in order to determine crash risks, test solutions, and evaluate results to improve highway safety.</li> <li><strong>The University of Central Florida&nbsp;</strong>will integrate a variety of real-time and static traffic data in order to allow state and local transportation professionals to use predictive analytics and diagnose real-time safety conditions.</li> <li><strong>Uber</strong>will combine Kepler.gl, its web-based tool that visualizes large-scale geolocation data sets, and historical speed data collected from Uber trips with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&rsquo;s Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data in order to allow local transportation professionals to better visualize traffic safety data in metropolitan areas.</li> <li><strong>VHB </strong>will use pedestrian avatars and apply game theory techniques to help the decision-maker &ldquo;see&rdquo; potential safety improvements from the pedestrian&rsquo;s perspective in order to inform state and local transportation professionals.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Stage II, Concept</strong></p>
<p>In Stage II, the five semi-finalists from Stage I will develop their ideations into proofs of concept (i.e., detailed system designs and prototypes) for an analytical visualization tool. The five semi-finalists will compete for part of a $100,000 prize purse for their proofs of concept. Based on review of the Stage II submissions by the judges, two of the five semi-finalists will also advance to Stage III as finalists. An additional semi-finalist may also receive an honorable mention, but not advance to Stage III. If a selectee declines to participate in the next stage, an alternate may be selected.</p>
<p><strong>Stage II finalists:</strong></p>
<ul> <li><strong>Ford Motor Co.</strong> will combine traditional crash data with connected vehicle and driver behavior, social media, and population data along with the Highway Safety Manual and Crash Modification Factors to help decision-makers uncover insights about safety opportunity areas, simulate potential interventions, and evaluate predicted impact.</li> <li><strong> The University of Central Florida</strong> will use Artificial Intelligence and integrate real-time and static data, providing predictive analytics and diagnosing real-time traffic safety conditions to suggest real-time interventions and long-term countermeasures to decision makers and operators and inform the public of zip-code level safety conditions.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Stage III, Tool</strong></p>
<p>In Stage III, the two finalists from Stage II will further develop their proofs of concept into full working analytical visualization tools. The two finalists will compete for a $250,000 prize purse, with each receiving a minimum of $50,000. The Stage III prize purse will be awarded to the winners based on the judges&rsquo; review of the Stage III submissions.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge Winner:</strong></p>
<ul> <li><strong> The University of Central Florida&rsquo;s</strong> tool uses advanced analytics, including machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI), to predict elevated crash risk in real time and suggest safety countermeasures that could be implemented instantly and in the longer term. It integrates real time data from sources that are primarily used for traffic management with static data.</li> </ul>
