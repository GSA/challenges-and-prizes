</ul>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Consider a scenario where developers, data scientists, machine learning (ML) engineers, etc., have access to training-quality datasets via the Overmatch Software Armory‚Äôs (OSA) secure, shore-based, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) enabled environment. Pipelined training-quality datasets are stored in Apache Parquet format and readily available for query, discovery, and retrieval from RESTful Services via Swagger UI, Command Line Interface (CLI), and/or the Java software development kit (SDK). The OSA environment also provides access to pertinent artificial intelligence (AI) tooling, e.g. Anaconda, Amazon Web Services (AWS) SageMaker, etc., which is used to perform data engineering, build/train ML models, and/or develop AI-enabled capabilities (e.g. Natural Language Processing / Natural Language Understanding (NLP/NLU), reasoning, planning, etc.).</p>

<p>The AI Prize Challenge, hereinafter referred to as the ‚ÄúChallenge‚Äù, is focused on quickly identifying operationally relevant innovations and emerging AI-enabled technologies. Selected participants will be invited to demonstrate candidate technologies in the Overmatch Software Armory (OSA), which will provide participants VDI access to a secure, government-owned Commercial Cloud Service Provider (CCSP). AI technologies are expected to be containerized and deployed to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OSCP) version 4.6.</p>

<p>Datasets will be made available to participants in two forms: datasets and filesets. Dataset and fileset descriptions are provided in section, <strong>Judging Criteria - AI iRIL, Datasets, and Filesets</strong>.</p>
