<p><strong>Prize Breakdown:</strong></p>

<p>The Seeker intends to select up to three finalists to receive awards of $15,000 each from a total award pool of $45,000. The Challenge award will be contingent upon results of critical analysis and evaluation by the Seeker. Meeting the Technical Requirements does not guarantee that the proposed solution will receive an award from the Seeker. Partial cash prizes of less than $15,000 may be considered for solutions that meet some, but not all, of the criteria. The Seeker can also allocate higher individual award amounts, as deemed appropriate.</p>

<p>Depending on the results of this Challenge and on the availability of funds, the Seeker may conduct a second phase Challenge, asking Solvers to submit prototypes for testing. This second phase, if it occurs, will be open but not restricted to the winners of this first phase of the Challenge.</p>
