I"5<p><strong>Judging Panel</strong></p>

<p>Provide any information you want your solvers to know about who will be evaluating their submissions.
Technical reviewers with expertise relevant to the Challenge will evaluate the Solutions based on their ability to achieve the criteria listed below. The Solutions and evaluation statements from the technical reviewers will then be reviewed by federal employees serving as judges, who will select the Challenge winners as well as any honorable mentions, subject to a final decision by the Award Approving Official.</p>

<p>The Award Approving Official will be Dr. Micky Tripathi, the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.</p>

<p>Provide a heading, description and weight (if applicable) for each criteria submissions will be evaluated by. You can provide a general summary of how submissions will be evaluated if you donâ€™t have individual weighted criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Judging Criteria</strong></p>

<p>Basis Upon Which Phase I Proposals will be Evaluated</p>

<ul>
  <li>The proposal complies with all Phase I submission requirements.</li>
  <li>The proposal clearly articulates the Challenge category it plans to address.</li>
  <li>The proposal supports enhancements of Synthea and/or Synthea generated synthetic data.</li>
  <li>The proposal includes a validation component.</li>
  <li>The proposal addresses one of the following use cases: Opioids, Pediatrics, and/or Complex Care.</li>
  <li>The participant agrees to submit non-proprietary source code as part of their Phase II submission.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Basis Upon Which Phase II Solutions Will be Evaluated</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Evaluation Criterion 1: Impact and Innovation (15 points)</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The extent to which the solution is novel, groundbreaking, and/or a creative application of an existing approach.</li>
  <li>The extent to which the solution supports enhancements of Synthea and/or Synthea generated synthetic data.</li>
  <li>The extent to which the solution may impact the field of research.</li>
  <li>The extent to which the solution provides new insights on the use of synthetic data for research.</li>
  <li>The extent to which the solution may encourage the use of Synthea and/or Synthea generated synthetic data.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Evaluation Criterion 2: Functionality and Implementation (20 points)</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The extent to which the solution enhances Synthea functionality and/or addresses known limitations of Synthea.</li>
  <li>The extent to which other developers and/or implementers can reproduce and/or reuse the solution.</li>
  <li>The extent to which the demonstration of the solution functionality (via YouTube video) aligns with the defined objectives of the solution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Evaluation Criterion 3: Validation (15 points)</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The extent to which the solution supports and/or improves validation capabilities of Synthea.</li>
  <li>The extent to which the solution improves the clinical relevance of Synthea generated synthetic data.</li>
  <li>The extent to which other developers and/or implementers can reproduce and/or reuse the validation methods produced by the solution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Bonus Points (up to 5 points)</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>May be awarded for going beyond the Challenge requirements to demonstrate or provide recommendations for:
    <ul>
      <li>Overcoming the limitations of Synthea,</li>
      <li>Addressing validation anomalies, and/or</li>
      <li>Other recommendations for solutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
