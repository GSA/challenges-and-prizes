I"¯<p>Twenty-twoÂ million workers are exposed to potentially damaging noise at work each year.Â Last year, U.S. businesses paid more thanÂ $1.5 million in penaltiesÂ for not protecting workers.Â While itâ€™s impossible to put a number on the human toll ofÂ hearing loss, an estimated $242 million is spent annually on workersâ€™ compensation for hearing loss disability.    Hearing loss is pervasive. It is also preventable. Ways to prevent work-induced hearing loss include using quieter machines, isolating the noise source, minimizing worker exposure, or creating more effective protective equipment.    Design a new technology concept that overcomes barriers in work-induced hearing loss prevention. For example, you could:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Design technology that will enhance employer training so that wearing hearing protection becomes a habit.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Design a real-time detection system that will alert workers, wirelessly through their mobile devices, when hearing protection is not blocking enough noise to prevent hearing loss.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Design selective hearing protectors that allow workers to hear important alerts or human voices while protected from harmful noise.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Donâ€™t limit yourself to these threeÂ ideas. Use your experiences to inspire a solution.    Please visit the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/featured/hearing/">Hear and Now main webpage</a> for more information.</p>
