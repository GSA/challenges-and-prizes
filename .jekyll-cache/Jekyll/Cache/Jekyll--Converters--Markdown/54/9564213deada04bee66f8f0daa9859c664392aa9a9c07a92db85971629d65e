      <td>SBIR Waveform Challenge incentivizes small businesses to propose innovative, viable technology concepts to the Army to develop an open hardware architecture for software defined radios (SDRs) that can facilitate the decoupling of hardware and software-based waveforms. Each participant with a selected Concept White Paper will receive a $10,000 prize and be invited to participate in Part 2: Technology Pitches where participants will have an opportunity to present their technology concept to an Army panel. Winners of the Part 2: Technology Pitches will each receive a $50,000 prize and will be invited to participate in Part 3, to submit either a Phase I SBIR or a Direct to Phase II (D2PhII) SBIR proposal to prototype their proposed technology innovations. Prize money will be awarded to selected participants through the Army xTech program and SBIR contract awards will be awarded through the Army SBIR program.</td>

<p>TOPIC: Waveform Challenge for Tactical Radios</p>

<p>PROBLEM STATEMENT: The Army seeks a standardized, open architecture, non-proprietary SDR that may be configured to adapt to various waveforms, frequency bands, bandwidths, and modes of operation to support tactical, terrestrial communications requirements on the battlefield. Specifically, they aim to identify and source interoperable, platform agnostic solutions to encourage innovation and economies of scale. Current Army tactical SDRs exhibit 2 proprietary hardware and software integration by a single vendor, which reduces potential waveform innovation and competitive pricing for future enhancements and upgrades. Science and Technology (S&amp;T) intellectual property (IP) providers lack a clear entry point into the Armyâ€™s SDR value chain. The Army desires an open hardware architecture that can enable innovative S&amp;T development activities to provide rapid demonstrations of new capabilities. The SDR architecture shall support the integration of waveforms, software solutions, and updates.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Develop a standardized, open hardware architecture (e.g., Software Communications Architecture (SCA), C4ISR Modular Open Suite of Standards (CMOSS), and Modular Open RF Architecture (MORA )) that facilitates the decoupling of hardware and associated software-based waveforms, enabling of multi-vendor solutions, rapid integration of waveforms, and competitive pricing.</p>

<p>CONCEPT WHITE PAPER INSTRUCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS: The white paper shall discuss the feasibility and assessment of a standardized, open radio hardware architecture that would enable third party (non-original equipment manufacturer (OEM)) waveform developers to easily develop and integrate new waveforms to a radio. The radio architecture should target tactical Army users addressing both mounted (e.g., ground vehicular) and dismounted (e.g., handheld or man portable radios) terrestrial communication applications. The assessment of the architecture should focus on supporting advanced networking waveforms which support voice and data communications. Ideal traits of the hardware architecture and supported waveforms include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>High-degree of scalability (support complex waveforms) and extended communications range.</li>
  <li>Common commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, that are readily available and do not require custom manufacturing.</li>
  <li>Standard design practices, standard interfaces for software, and FieldProgrammable Gate Array (FPGA) development to abstract platform specifics to the greatest extent possible.</li>
  <li>Use of existing industry standard SDR architectures to the greatest extent possible (e.g., SCA, CMOSS, and MORA).</li>
  <li>Ability to maximize effective data rate, throughput, and range while operating within established spectrum guidelines.</li>
</ul>
