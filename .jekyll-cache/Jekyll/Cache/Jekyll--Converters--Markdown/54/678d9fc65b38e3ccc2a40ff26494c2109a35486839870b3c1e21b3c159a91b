I"d<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), located within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces the launch of the Million Hearts&reg; Hypertension Control Challenge.</p>
<p>Million Hearts&reg;&nbsp;is a national initiative to prevent one million heart attacks and strokes by 2022. Achieving this goal means 10 million more Americans must have their blood pressure under control. Million Hearts&reg; is working to control high blood pressure through clinical approaches, such as using health information technology to its fullest potential and integrating team-based approaches to health care, and community approaches, such as strengthening tobacco control and promoting physical activity.</p>
<p>To support improved blood pressure control, HHS/CDC is announcing the 2018 Million Hearts&reg; Hypertension Control Challenge. This competition identifies practices, clinicians, and health systems that have worked with their patients to achieve hypertension control rates at or above 80% through innovations in health information technology and electronic health records, patient communication, and health care team approaches. The application will be scored based on the hypertension control rate for your most recent 12-month reporting period ending not earlier than December 31, 2017; and the degree to which the patient populations' characteristics present significant challenges in attaining hypertension control (up to 5% score). Applicants with the highest score will be required to participate in a two-phase process to verify their data. Applicants who are non-compliant or non-responsive with the data requests or timelines will be removed from further consideration.</p>
<p>Phase 1 includes verification of the hypertension prevalence and blood pressure control rate data submitted and a background check. For applicants whose Phase 1 data is verified as accurate, phase 2 consists of a medical chart review. In addition, background checks will be conducted by an independent source for individual or small practice applicants to ensure there are no serious sanctions or that other misconduct has occurred (as outlined in the Eligibility section). For large providers or health systems, their background check policy and implementation will be reviewed for compliance with the individual background check protocol. In addition, a health system background check will include a search for The Joint Commission's sanctions and current investigations for serious institutional misconduct (e.g., investigations for professional medical misconduct).</p>
<p>Phase 2 of the validation, for applicants whose Phase 1 data is verified as accurate, consists of hypertension control validation via medical chart review. Applicants must provide documents showing the criteria used to include patients as "controlled" and a list with each hypertensive patient found to have blood pressure in control. Thirty patient records will be selected randomly for file review for compliance. For the thirty records selected, electronic copies of all of the pertinent medical records will be submitted through a secure FTP site with a secure login.</p>
