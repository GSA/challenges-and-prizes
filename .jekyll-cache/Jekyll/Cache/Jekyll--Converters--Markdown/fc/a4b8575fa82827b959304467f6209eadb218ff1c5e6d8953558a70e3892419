I"R<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) hosted a prize competition that challenged the public to create a technical solution (“tool”) that consumers can use to guard against security vulnerabilities in software found on the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in their homes.    The FTC asked for a tool that would, at a minimum, help protect consumers from security vulnerabilities caused by out-of-date software. Contestants had the option of adding features, such as those that would address hard-coded, factory default or easy-to-guess passwords.    The prize purse for the competition was up to $25,000 for a winner, with $3,000 available for each honorable mention winner(s). Winners have been announced.
