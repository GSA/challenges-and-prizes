I"’<p>With recent advancements in deep learning, the capabilities of automatic face recognition has been significantly increased. However, face recognition in unconstrained environment with non-cooperative users is still a research challenge, pertinent for users such as law enforcement agencies. While several covariates such as pose, expression, illumination, aging, and low resolution have received significant attention, ‚Äúdisguise‚Äù is still considered an arduous covariate of face recognition. Disguise as a covariate involves both intentional and unintentional changes on a face through which one can either obfuscate his/her identity or impersonate someone else‚Äôs identity. The problem can be further exacerbated due to unconstrained environment or ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù scenarios. However, disguise in the wild has not been studied in a comprehensive way, primarily due to unavailability of such as database. As part of 1<sup>st</sup> International Workshop on Disguised Face in the Wild at CVPR 2018, a competition is being held in which participants are asked to show their results on the Disguised Faces in the Wild (DFW) database.¬† More details on the workshop and competition are available at: <a href="http://iab-rubric.org/DFW/dfw.html">http://iab-rubric.org/DFW/dfw.html</a>.</p>
<p>Prize awards for the DFW 2018 Competition are provided by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).<br />    <strong>Two phases of the competition and winners:</strong>    The competition involves two phases. The early phase involves the participants with early access to the data with an opportunity to submit a paper describing their approach. The second phase participants will have more time to submit their score results but will not be able to submit a written paper. However, the second phase participants may be invited to orally present their work based on their performance results at the CVPR workshop.¬† Teams may elect to participate in either or both phases.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1:</strong>  <ul>    <li><strong>Enrollment deadline for the overall competition:</strong> February 23, 2018</li>    <li><strong>Result Submissions due to Organizers:</strong> March 05, 2018 - UPDATED</li>    <li><strong>Invitation to top performing participants for paper submission (results will not be released publicly):</strong> Mar 07, 2018</li>    <li><strong>Paper submissions by selected Competition Participants due to organizers:</strong> Mar 20, 2018</li>    <li><strong>Notification provided authors:</strong> Apr 05, 2018</li>    <li><strong>Camera-ready deadline:</strong> Apr 09, 2018</li>  </ul>  <strong>Phase 2:</strong>  <ul>    <li><strong>Final results submissions to Organizers:</strong> May 01, 2018</li>    <li><strong>Winners of the competition announced based on final Comparative Results:</strong> May 10, 2018</li>  </ul></p>
<p>Results will be announced at the end of Phase 2 based on submission received up until the May 1<sup>st</sup> deadline. Participants are permitted to submit one set of results to Phase 1 and then resubmit a second set of revised/final results to Phase 2.¬† No paper submission is possible for participants who <strong>only</strong> participate in Phase 2, but winners will be invited to give an oral presentation on their work at the CVPR workshop.    <strong>Questions?</strong>    In case of any difficulties or questions, please email to <a href="mailto:rsingh@iiitd.ac.in">rsingh@iiitd.ac.in</a>.</p>
