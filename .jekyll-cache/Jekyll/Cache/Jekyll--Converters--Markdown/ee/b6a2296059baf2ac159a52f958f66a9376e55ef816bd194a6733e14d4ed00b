Evidence might include documented changes in response rates after the district implemented its solution. Because response rates are so closely associated with sample size, an increase in household response in the absence of a reduction in sample size is the strongest evidence of effectiveness.</p> </div> <div class="prize-item"> <h4>Research and Creativity - <strong class="text-primary">35%</strong> </h4> <p>Judges will award up to 35 points for solutions that make effective use of independent research and creativity. Solutions that reveal new insight into the barriers to household response, and offer creative approaches to overcome those barriers, will receive the most points in this category.</p> </div> <div class="prize-item"> <h4>Presentation, Clarity, and Persuasiveness - <strong class="text-primary">30%</strong> </h4> <p>Judges will award up to 30 points for presentation, clarity, and persuasiveness. Some solutions may be untested. In other cases, the impact on household response may be difficult to prove. One goal of this challenge is to begin a discussion to generate new ideas or refine existing approaches. Participants advance that goal with well-written solutions that make a persuasive case for their adoption.</p> </div> </div>
