	<li>A concept for defining and evaluating how well the students have achieved the objectives of the program, including a comprehensive survey for the students and a description of how the digital assignment outcome will be assessed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase II: Program Design</strong></p>

<p>The Phase I finalists will receive $20,000 each and will have one month from the date of this award, to transform their program concepts into a detailed program designs, which meet the requirements provided below. One finalist will be selected as the winner of the challenge.¬† The winner‚Äôs name will be posted on Challenge.gov.</p>

<p>The finalists chosen in Phase I shall prepare a detailed program design, including the following three sections:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Program Description</strong>
<ul>
	<li>More details on the major content focus areas with their performance objectives,</li>
	<li>Comprehensive Syllabus</li>
	<li>Defined instructional strategies and educational method for each content area,</li>
	<li>Mock-ups or prototypes,</li>
	<li>Proposed speaker lists,</li>
	<li>How a digital assignment will be incorporated into the program,</li>
	<li>An understanding of how the program components will achieve the desired program outcomes,</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Assessment Plan</strong>
<ul>
	<li>More details on the planned assessment of how well the students have achieved the objectives of the program;</li>
	<li>A remediation plan for trainees who do not achieve the goals; and</li>
	<li>A concept for a Capstone or Practical Skills Test that might be required for certification.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Anticipated Cost to Implement Program</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The estimated investment required to implement both the pilot and the resulting program. The pilot would be estimated on a basis of 30 students as will the resulting program. If the pilot is a scaled-down version of the fully-implemented program, the differentiation must be explained.</li>
	<li>Any expected intangible benefits related to the program, or ways to leverage quantities of scale strategies to facilitate a widespread adoption of the program in the government.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase II Oral Proposal </strong></p>

<p>This program design will be presented to the judges through oral proposals. Additionally, a one hour mock classroom training shall be provided to the judges in order for the challengers to demonstrate one aspect of their proposed design. It will be up to the challenger to determine which aspect and method of delivery will best encompass the concept of their proposed design.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Phase III:¬† Program Development and Pilot</strong></p>

<p>The challenge winner receives up to $250,000 in milestone payments and will have five months to develop and implement their design with up to 30 government contracting students.¬† Milestone payments will be made based on mutually agreed upon deliverables throughout the pilot based on the accepted design. An initial milestone payment will be determined to assist with the startup costs of the pilot.</p>

<p>OMB will select and provide students for the pilot project.¬† The students in the pilot project will be selected from contracting professionals who are certified at the Federal Acquisition Certification ‚Äì Contracting (FAC-C) or Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) Level II or above. These pilot students are the target demographic for the program, are influential early adopters of new and innovative acquisition strategies, and will have some experience in IT acquisition. These students will have managerial commitment and approval to fully participate and meet the requirements of the pilot; however it is anticipated that pilot participants will be not required to be 100% assigned to the pilots for the entire length of the program, and will remain in their current jobs during the pilot.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Assignment:</strong> ¬†¬†In order to help judge the effectiveness of the training and development program, as part of the pilot, the Federal contracting students will be expected to complete a ‚Äúlive‚Äù digital service assignment, which could be an actual project, procurement, or agency engagement. OMB will work with the Phase II winner to determine which assignment is best-suited for its specific pilot based on its proposed design.</p>

<p>In this phase, the training and development program is developed and major components are piloted by the Phase II winner with up to 30 students to validate the content, feasibility, instructional strategies, and expected outcomes of the training program. There shall be complete lesson plans, participant materials, mock-ups and prototypes, and training aids to test during the pilot delivery. The pilot program delivery is the ‚Äútest drive‚Äù of the proposed challenge solution to determine whether it meets expected outcomes. In addition to the students assigned to the pilot, OMB will provide key stakeholders and government subject matter experts who can provide other limited assistance required to develop and pilot the program as requested by the challenger in Phases I and II. OMB will assist the Phase II winner with the identification of current Procurements/Projects/Digital Service teams that students will be assigned to work on during the course of the pilot. The nature of the assignment chosen will be based on a discussion between the Phase II winner and OMB during pilot program preparation.¬† Sample assignments might include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Conducting a solicitation from Request For Proposal to Award to establish a Federal-wide Blanket Purchase Agreement.</li>
	<li>Working with a Digital Service Agency team on drafting a Request for Proposal.</li>
	<li>Assisting GSA‚Äôs 18F with a consulting effort and resulting acquisition.</li>
	<li>Drafting a Digital Service Agency team‚Äôs acquisition strategy for multiple projects/acquisitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission shall include an end user survey to be delivered to the students based on the proposed program concept which will be used to determine how confident the participants are in their ability to apply the knowledge and skills learned.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Final Submission: Results of Pilot and Update of Proposed Program </strong></p>

<p>Upon completion of the pilot, the following information shall be provided to OMB by January 31, 2016 to help OMB judge the outcome of the proposed training and development program:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Results of the assessment of how well the students achieved the objectives of the proposed program, and update of the proposed remediation plan and concept for a Capstone or Practical Skills Test that might be required for certification;</li>
	<li>Any logistical problems that surfaced in the execution of the pilot (this could relate to scheduling challenges, absenteeism on behalf of the participants, physical or logical roadblocks encountered), including what was done to resolve the problems, or what should be done if a scaled program were to be implemented to ensure success;</li>
	<li>The pilot‚Äôs actual cost breakdown including contract services, equipment, facilities, hardware, software, training materials, as it relates to the proposed submission (this could include return on investment evaluations and alternative analyses);</li>
	<li>An accountability report that captures how well the pilot was executed (pilot‚Äôs projected cost breakdown compared to the actual cost breakdown) and how quality was measured to get the expected results of the pilot.</li>
	<li>The documented program design incorporating lessons learned and any changes made to the design initially proposed;</li>
	<li>The final estimated investment required to implement the proposed program; and</li>
	<li>A description of how Return on Investment (ROI) should be monitored (e.g., linkage to performance metrics, etc.).</li>
