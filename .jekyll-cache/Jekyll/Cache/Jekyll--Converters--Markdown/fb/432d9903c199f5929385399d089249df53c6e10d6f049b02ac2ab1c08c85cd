I"€<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Taxpayers have the right to be informed, which includes access to their personal taxpayer data. Many taxpayers, however, might not know where to find this information or how to use it, as much of this information reads like a receipt and can be hard to understandÂ for those who are not finance professionals.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The goal of this challengeÂ is to reimagine the taxpayer experience and design the taxpayer experience of the future. With over 200 data fieldsÂ at play, how might weÂ design, organize, and present tax information in a way thatÂ makes it easierÂ for taxpayers to manage their taxpayer responsibilities, and to use their own taxpayer dataÂ to make informed and effective decisions about their personalÂ finances?</span></p>
<p><em><strong><em>  Background Materials</em></strong></em>    The variables in the Tax Data Document (TDD) represent the type of personalized data that may comprise a personâ€™s tax information, including refund status, transactions, and line-by-line tax return information for specific tax years. Entrants should use some or all of these variables as part of their submission for an improved experience. Use of every variable in the TDD is not required; submissions may include additional variables that are not in the TDD.    <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/TaxDataDocument.xlsx" rel="">TaxDataDocument</a>.xlsx    The Sample Tax DataÂ is for illustrative purposes only â€” to show how many of the data fields in the TDD are currently displayed.    <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SampleTaxData.pdf" rel="">SampleTaxData</a>.pdf    <em><strong><em>  Mentors</em></strong></em>    Network with over two dozenÂ mentors available for this challenge â€“ strategists and designers who have built products at Betterment, Google, Morningstar, Social Behavioral Sciences Team, United States Digital Service, and many more; andÂ leadersÂ within the IRS with digital and tax expertise.
