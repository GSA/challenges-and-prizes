I" <p>The eRulemaking program seeks to pilot an open-source application that can be utilized by interested public and private organizations to better discover proposed rules that are open for comment while providing public commenters with useful information.    The solution would link regulatory data to information that is not always available on the current <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">Regulations.gov</a> webpage. Examples include industry, geographic areas of interest, regulated substance or facility (when appropriate).Â  The pilot should at a minimum be able to link proposed rules relevant to the clean air act to the aforementioned fields of interest.</p>
