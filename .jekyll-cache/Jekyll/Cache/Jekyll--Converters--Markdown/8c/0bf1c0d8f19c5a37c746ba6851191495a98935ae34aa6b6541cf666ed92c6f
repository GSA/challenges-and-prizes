Judging Criteria will be based on the following:    <strong>Visual Impact</strong>  A successful entry provides viewers with new scientific insight, is visually striking, and conveys the artistâ€™s skill and expertise in the chosen medium (e.g., photography). It conveys the artistâ€™s mastery of the fundamentals and principles of design and is executed with factual accuracy.    <strong>Effective Communication</strong>  A successful entry communicates in a clear and understandable manner. It uses plain language, both written and spoken, in the entry itself and its accompanying text. An entry also must convey science, technology, engineering, or mathematics principles.    <strong>Freshness and Originality</strong>  A successful entry has an individual voice, vitality, and energy, creates a novel presentation or tells a compelling story, and portrays new scientific insight and methods..
