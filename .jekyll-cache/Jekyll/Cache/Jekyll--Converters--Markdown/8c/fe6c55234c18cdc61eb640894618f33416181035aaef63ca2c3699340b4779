I"È<p>For additional Challenge details, including specific requirements for the sensor systems, please register at <a href="https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933927">https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933927</a>. All official submissions must be received via this InnoCentive website.
<strong>Submission:</strong> The submission to the Challenge should include the following:Â 
Step 1:Â  A written preview of the proposed solution addressing specific Solution Requirements presented in the Challenge. The written preview, expected to be about 3 pages, should include a brief description of the measurement principle for the four target pollutants, size (weight and dimensions), power requirements, maintenance procedures, data communications, and cost estimate for a production scale, turn-key sensor network kit composed of six sensor nodes and one central data receiving unit. You should also include a photograph of the prototype sensor system (not part of the 3 pages above). This preview will be reviewed to ensure the proposed system can be accepted for laboratory evaluation.
Step 2:Â  If the proposed solution is accepted for testing, the Solver will provide:Â  1. A prototype sensor system capable of rapid deployment and continuous monitoring of air pollution during a fire event. The system should include a central data receiving unit and at least two nodes that collect air quality and location data that is transmitted back to the central receiving unit on a 5-minute frequency. The central data receiving unit may be cloud-based if FedRAMP compliant (fedramp.gov). 2. Supporting documentation, including the following:Â  1) Operation manual with sufficient detail for an end user to independently operate and maintain the sensor system, 2) Description of any potential safety hazards were the system to be exposed to fire, and 3) Cost estimate for a production scale, turn-key sensor network kit composed of six sensor nodes and one central data receiving unit</p>
