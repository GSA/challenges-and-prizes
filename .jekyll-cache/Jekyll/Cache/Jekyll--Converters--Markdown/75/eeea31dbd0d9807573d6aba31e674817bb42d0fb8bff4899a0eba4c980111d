I"ï<p>Rachel from Cardholder Services is one of the most notorious and most annoying robocallers ever. The FTC is challenging the tech-savvy public to help us zap Rachel and her robocall buddies by creating the next-generation robocall honeypot at DEF CON 22. A robocall honeypot is an information system designed to attract robocallers, which can help researchers and investigators understand and combat illegal calls. Participants must attend DEF CON 22 in Las Vegas in order to participate.</p>
