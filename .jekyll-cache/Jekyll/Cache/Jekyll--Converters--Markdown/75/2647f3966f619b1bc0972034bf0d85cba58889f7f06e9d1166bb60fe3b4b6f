Teams must include at least one designer (an artist, architect, landscape architect, urban designer and/or planner), and are encouraged to include members with expertise in technology, storytelling, history, commemoration, visual arts, and the social sciences. The competition partners will select three teams to each receive $15,000 stipends to participate in a research and design process.&lt;/p&gt;    <strong>LOCATION</strong><br />    The competition proposals should be based on specific places or areas in Washington D.C. Proposals may take a physical form or may be virtual. Preference will be given to teams that propose a site or sites <strong>outside of</strong> the National Mall. The following locations are suggestions reflecting typical opportunity sites for new memorials in Washington:    Near the monumental core: <br /><strong>The Belvedere </strong>  The Belvedere is located on waterfront parkland within West Potomac Park and is bounded by the Potomac River to the west, the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge to the north, and the Rock Creek Parkway to the east. The Belvedere is also situated between the Kennedy Center to the north and the Lincoln Memorial to the south, providing a visual link between the two structures. The Belvedere is the historic terminus of the western end of Constitution Avenue and provides open vistas across the Potomac River to Virginia, as well as the natural environment of Rock Creek and West Potomac Parks.    Within a residential area: <br /><strong>Randle Circle or Tenley Circle</strong><br />  Memorials must be integrated with community uses and goals for public plazas and open space. Implementation of new memorials within the city’s residential areas must be closely coordinated with neighborhood plans prepared by local residents and elected officials.<br />    <strong>Randle Circle</strong> is located in a residential neighborhood in Southeast Washington, D.C. Randle Circle comprises two landscaped parcels that are associated with the intersection of Massachusetts and Minnesota Avenues, SE. The entrance to Fort Dupont Park, part of the National Park System and the Civil War Defenses of Washington, is located on Randle Circle. The character of the surrounding neighborhood should be considered in any future memorial for the site.    <br /><strong>Tenley Circle</strong> is located in a vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood setting and is within walking distance of the Tenleytown-American University Metro station. Tenley Circle comprises several landscaped parcels that are associated with the intersection of Wisconsin and Nebraska Avenues, NW. While the total land area associated with this site is significant, the central parcels, located on Wisconsin Avenue, are small and occupied by existing transit uses (bus stops). In conjunction with several out-parcels, Tenley Circle is suitable for commemorative features. The character of the surrounding neighborhood should be considered in any future memorial for the site.    <br />Around a natural setting: <strong>Hains Point</strong>  Hains Point is located at the confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers and is part of East Potomac Park. The site is bounded by the Washington Channel and the Potomac River shorelines and offers dramatic waterfront vistas within the established open space setting of the park. Adjoining park uses include passive and active recreation such as golf, swimming, jogging, and biking. Existing site conditions are waterfront landscaped parkland with open lawn areas and clusters of trees. The site is accessible throughout the year by vehicle from Ohio Drive. Although East Potomac Park is envisioned as the location for future commemorative works, Hains Point has not been specifically designated as the location for a memorial.     </p>
