I"ﬂ*<p>Biological threats (otherwise known as ‚Äúbiothreats‚Äù) are everyone‚Äôs concern. Whether you‚Äôre a private citizen, a city administrator, or government official, we all share a common interest in keeping our communities healthy and safe.    Biothreats occur when harmful <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/emerging-infectious-diseases-pathogens">pathogens</a> are either naturally or deliberately released, posing a risk to national security and public health. Some of these pathogens can be transmitted from person to person, from inhalation or ingestion; and from exposure to powders, liquids, or aerosols. Infections caused by biothreats can lead to respiratory distress, gastrointestinal issues, and animal and human deaths. Often, biothreats are hard to immediately identify, and their spread can be hard to contain. If and when a potential biothreat appears, every minute counts. Local and national officials must work together to assess the level of risk, develop an action plan, and intervene. Currently, there are a variety of systems and tools in place; however, these tools largely rely on health data to detect signals. With the increasing proliferation of new technologies and data sources, such as the wealth of open data generated by progressively ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù cities and the trends that can now be observed through the aggregation of individual sharing, we now have an unprecedented opportunity. By harnessing these new streams of information, we may be able to identify an emerging problem more quickly and confidently, so we can ultimately resolve it faster.    Are early signals hiding in data we already have?    How could we use this publicly-accessible data to help identify emerging biothreats, contain their spread, and save lives?    With the Hidden Signals Challenge, DHS calls upon data innovators from a wide variety of fields‚Äî from data science, to civic tech, to epidemiology‚Äî to develop concepts for novel uses of existing data that will identify signals and achieve timelier alerts for biothreats in our cities and communities. Successful concepts will explore connections between multiple readily accessible data sources, to develop real-time insights that can improve public safety responses to emerging biothreats. DHS intends for this work to be the first step in the design of a local and/or national-level system that could enable city-level operators to make critical and proactive decisions based on the most relevant and actionable insights. The Challenge focuses on large metropolitan areas such as New York, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Chicago, Boston, and Atlanta as the basis for a proof of concept, but is open to solutions that address all geographic locations.    <strong>Have questions?¬†Click </strong><a href="https://www.hiddensignalschallenge.com/preparing-submission-informational-webinar/">here</a><strong> to explore the archived informational webinar; it provides an in-depth overview of the Challenge, discuss what DHS is looking for, and covers Stage 1 and Stage 2.</strong>    <em><strong>Follow along by subscribing to the <a href="https://luminary-labs.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=441bc2dfe9a009f0cf6c7d02b&amp;id=f97e8aad2e">Hidden Signals Challenge Newsletter</a></strong></em>    <strong><em>This is a multi-stage prize competition with a total cash prize pool of $300,000.</em></strong>    <strong>Stage 1</strong>    Stage 1 seeks concepts for novel uses of existing data that will identify signals and achieve timelier alerts for biothreats in our cities and communities. Up to five (5) Finalists in the first stage of this prize competition will be selected by the judges according to official Challenge criteria and will each be awarded $20,000 in cash prizes.    <strong>Stage 2 </strong>    Finalists from Stage 1 will move forward to Stage 2, where they will further develop their concepts into detailed system designs, with guidance from expert mentors as they compete for additional cash prizes. At the end of Stage 2, Finalists will be required to submit these detailed system designs, which will describe how concepts from Stage 1 are to be implemented in practice..    <strong>Submission Requirements</strong>: To be eligible to win a prize under this Competition, the Solver shall have registered to participate in the contest under the process and Solver User Agreement identified on the contest‚Äôs official entry site, which may be accessed at www.hiddensignalschallenge.com (hereafter referenced simply as ‚ÄúCompetition Website‚Äù).    The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) calls upon data innovators from a wide variety of fields‚Äî from data science, to civic tech, to epidemiology‚Äî to develop concepts for novel uses of existing data that will identify signals and achieve timelier alerts for biothreats in our cities and communities. Successful concepts will explore connections between multiple readily accessible data sources, to develop real-time insights that can improve public safety responses to emerging biothreats.
