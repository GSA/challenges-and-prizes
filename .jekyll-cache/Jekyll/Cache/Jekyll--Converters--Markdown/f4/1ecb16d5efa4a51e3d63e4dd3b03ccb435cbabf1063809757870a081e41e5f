Moreover, as is customary when doing business with the federal government, participants may not refer to GSA’s use of your submission (be it product or service) in any commercial advertising or similar promotions in a manner that states or implies that the product or service being used is endorsed or preferred by GSA or any other element of the federal government, or that the federal government considers it to be superior to other products or services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intent of this policy is to prevent the appearance of federal government bias toward any one product or service.    Participants agree that GSA’s trademarks, logos, service marks, trade names, or the fact that GSA awarded a prize to a Participant, shall not be used by the Participant to imply direct GSA endorsement of Participant or Participant’s submission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Participants and GSA may list the other party’s name in a publicly available customer or other list so long as the name is not displayed in a more prominent fashion than any other third party name.    <strong>PRIZES: </strong>GSA may award up to three team prizes $1,000 to each member of a winning team.  GSA is not required to award all prizes if the judges determine that a smaller number of entries meet the scope and requirements laid out for this competition, or if the Agency plans to only use code from a smaller number of entries.  Funding for this GSA Digital Innovation and Strategy competition award will come from GSA.&lt;/p&gt;Prizes will be awarded to the winner(s) of the competition via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), within 60 days of announcement of the winner(s). <strong> </strong>    <strong>REQUIREMENTS:  </strong>The final solution should be open source code and placed on GSA’s GitHub site.  Open source refers to a program in which the source code is available to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design free of charge.  In order to be Open Source Initiative Certified, the solution must meet the following ten criteria:  &lt;ol&gt;   &lt;li&gt;The author or holder of the license of the source code cannot collect royalties on the distribution of the program;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;The distributed program must make the source code accessible to the user;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;The author must allow modifications and derivations of the work under the program’s original name;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;No person, group, or field of endeavor can be denied access to the program;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program being part of a particular software distribution; and&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;The licensed software cannot place restrictions on other software that is distributed with it;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;The solution must be an online, interactive solution that meets the goals and objectives provided in this document;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;The solution must include documentation of all data sources used;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;The solution must include a description of how the solution can be updated with additional data from other agencies;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;The solver must provide recommendations to enhance Government insights through improvements in data collection.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  The winner(s) of the competition will, in consideration of the prize(s) to be awarded, grant to GSA a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use any and all intellectual property to the winning entry for any governmental purpose, including the right to permit such use by any other agency or agencies of the federal government.  All other rights of the winning entrant will be retained by the winner of the competition.    <strong>SCOPE:  </strong>Any federal data and information that is publicly available is included in the scope of this challenge.  Summary-level sample data will be provided.    <strong>CHALLENGE GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</strong>    <strong>GOAL:  </strong>Design and build an application, API, and/or data mashup while using GSA data that solves one of five GSA business problems provided at the Hack-a-thon.    <strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong>  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Utilize GSA data to create an application, API, and/ or data mashup.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Provide GSA a better understanding of use and needs of current and future data assets.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Post all open source solutions on GitHub for future use by the government developer community and GSA.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  <strong>REGISTRATION:  </strong>Registration for this event will be accomplished online at the following link <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/us-general-services-administration-gsa-hack-a-thon-tickets-15637828165">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/us-general-services-administration-gsa-hack-a-thon-tickets-15637828165</a><strong>, </strong>and shall remain open until May 5, 2015, <strong>(11:59 p.m. EST).  </strong>The event space is limited to the first 120 people; once registration is complete you shall receive a confirmation email.
