<p>EPA is partnering with the U.S. Department of Defenseâ€™s Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) and Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP); the Environmental Council of States (ECOS) and the Environmental Research Institute of the States (ERIS); Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy; and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, to launch a technical challenge regarding the destruction of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The challenge asks Solvers to submit detailed plans for a non-thermal way of destroying PFAS in concentrated aqueous film forming foam (AFFF), while creating the least amount of potentially harmful byproducts.</p>

<p>PFAS are a group of synthetic chemicals that have been widely used for more than 60 years to make plastics, firefighting foams, and lubricants, and to help make products stain-resistant, waterproof, and nonstick. Addressing and managing PFAS in the environment is one of the most pressing issues facing EPA and its partners. This issue is particularly challenging because PFAS chemicals have a very strong carbon-fluorine chemical bond that leads to persistence in the environment and makes their complete destruction extremely difficult. Given the ubiquitous nature of PFAS and increasing public concerns, EPA and its partners are looking for greater certainty when making decisions about disposal and treatment of PFAS containing materials and PFAS contaminated media/waste.</p>

<p>Although PFAS compounds can be found at different concentrations in various waste streams including aqueous film forming foam (AFFF), biosolids, ground water, sludge and soil, the challenge is focused on unused AFFF. Currently, EPA is investigating all methods of destroying PFAS. Incineration has been used to treat PFAS-contaminated media, and EPA scientists are collaborating with the private sector to evaluate the effectiveness of thermal treatment technologies to completely destroy PFAS. The goal of this challenge is to discover new non-thermal technologies and approaches that remove at least 99 percent of PFAS in unused AFFF while preventing the creation of harmful byproducts.</p>
