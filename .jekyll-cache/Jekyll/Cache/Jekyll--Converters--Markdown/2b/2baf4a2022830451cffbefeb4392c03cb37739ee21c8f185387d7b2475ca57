I"c<h4>Judging Panel</h4>
<p>The judging panel will consist of six subject matter experts selected by the Challenge Sponsors.</p>
<h4>Judging Criteria</h4>
<p>Submissions will be judged based on data generated for a common set of blinded reference samples provided to all Solvers and an accompanying Technology Description Template.</p>
<h4>Scoring Overview</h4>
<p>Scoring will be based on the weighted (% of total score) criteria provided in the tables below. Each criterion is scored based on either a nominal or fractional scale of 0-5 with 0 being the lowest and 5 being the highest, or by pass/fail with 5 being pass and 0 being fail.</p>
