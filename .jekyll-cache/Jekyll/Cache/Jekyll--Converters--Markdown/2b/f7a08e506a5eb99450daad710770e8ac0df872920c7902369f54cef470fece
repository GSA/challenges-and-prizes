<p>Teams participating in the AI Tracks at Sea Challenge spanned collegiate institutions from east to west U.S. coasts, from both public and private colleges and universities. Collectively, the student submissions for the challenge represent various types of STEM research institutions, Ivy League Schools, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Hispanic Serving Institutes (HSI). Of the challenge teams, 26% were comprised of students from HBCUs and 16% of the teams attend HSIs.</p>

<p>“With 94% of the competitors attending colleges and universities outside of California, this challenge served as an avenue to make broader impacts in STEM,” said Yolanda Tanner, Naval Information Warfare Systems Command (NAVWAR) STEM Federal Action Officer and NIWC Pacific Internship and Fellowship project manager. “It was also a means by which students could further develop their STEM skills while working collaboratively to solve a real-world naval problem.”</p>

<p>Florida, North Carolina, and Texas had the largest population of participating collegiate teams.</p>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>The Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC) Pacific and the Naval Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Coordination Office, managed by the Office of Naval Research are conducting the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tracks at Sea challenge.  The goal of this challenge is to engage with the workforce of tomorrow on challenging and relevant naval problems.  The need here is to augment unmanned surface vehicles’ (USVs’) maritime contact tracking capability.  Current traffic avoidance software relies on AIS and radar for tracking other craft and avoiding collisions.  However, in a contested environment, emitting radar energy presents a vulnerability to detection by adversaries.  Deactivating RF transmitting sources mitigates the threat of detection, but without additional sensing and sensor fusion, it would also degrade the USV’s ability to monitor shipping traffic in its vicinity.  The technology developed for this prize challenge will solve this problem by developing a computer vision system that will plot the tracks of shipping traffic exclusively using the passive sensing capability of onboard cameras.  This technology would also be applicable for the Navy to document vessels performing unsafe navigation on the high seas.</p>

<h4 id="prize-breakdown">Prize Breakdown</h4>

<p>The Challenge winners will be notified via email. NIWC Pacific will announce the winners on the Challenge.gov website and via appropriate channels.</p>

<p>NIWC Pacific has established $200,000 as the total amount set aside for cash prizes under this Challenge. Prizes will be awarded for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th places in the amounts of $55,000, $45,000, $35,000, $30,000, $20,000, $10,000, and $5000 respectively.  Prizes will be disbursed to the respective teams’ department, college, laboratory, or other eligible university component as specified by the consensus of the team.</p>

<p>In the event of a tie, NIWC Pacific will determine an equitable method of distributing the cash prizes. This method will based on anything extra included in the output of the tool (e.g. graphical representation or video of output, classification of vessel being tracked, characterization of the vessel’s behavior, insights into how the algorithm is making decisions, track prediction, etc.)</p>

<p>Tax treatment of prizes will be handled in accordance with U.S. Internal Revenue Service guidelines. The winner must provide a U.S. taxpayer identification number (TIN) (e.g., a TIN or employer identification number (EIN)) to receive the cash prize.</p>

<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>

<p>Each Team shall submit one entry in response to this Challenge. Team entries must have an individual identified as the primary point of contact and prize recipient. By submitting an entry, a Participant authorizes their institution’s name to be released to the media.</p>

<p>The submission package must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>white paper</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>White Paper Submission Guidelines</strong>:</p>

<p>White papers should provide an overview of the proposed technology and technical approach (e.g. architecture, deployment overview, algorithm description, model description, performance requirements, endpoint footprint, existing results, etc.), the benefits and novelty of the approach within the context of existing academic and commercially available technologies, and the dependencies necessary to operate the proposed technology.  White papers must be no more than five pages in length.  All white papers must be submitted along with the Participants tool per the instructions outlined in the tool submission guidelines below. </p>

<p><strong>Tool Submission Guidelines</strong>:</p>

<p>Submissions shall use docker and shall provide a container that the Challenge Manager can run along with a copy of their source code.  A good introductory example can be seen <a href="https://docker-curriculum.com/">here</a> (https://docker-curriculum.com/).</p>

<p>Submitters tool shall provide a command line executable container that will take four arguments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Video file name (MP4 format)</li>
  <li>Number of points to be generated</li>
  <li>Latitude of source in decimal degrees (i.e. where the camera is mounted)</li>
  <li>Longitude of the source in decimal degrees (i.e. where the camera is mounted)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Submitters shall take great care with the ease for the Challenge Manager to run their Containers.</p>

<p>Minimum output should be a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file that consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A timestamp in seconds that starts at zero</li>
  <li>Latitude and Longitude of the vessel(s) being tracked</li>
