I"≈<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong> Mining and Gas/oil exploration have led to great technology advances in detection of anomalies underground. Geologist can ‚Äúsee‚Äù pockets of materials through thousands of feet of rock. This usually works because there is a great contrast between the background (rock) and the target (oil). Also the ‚Äúpocket‚Äù of target material is usually quite large as well. Even with all this technology, however, it is still difficult to consistently find a void or ‚Äúhole‚Äù below ground.   <p></p> Voids / sinkholes underneath the ground‚Äôs surface are responsible for damage to many buildings and roads due to collapse. There is a need to detect underground voids / sinkholes as deep as 100 feet below the surface. A lot of work has been done to predict conditions where sinkholes can form, but actual detection from above is quite difficult.  <p></p>  <strong>KNOWN TECHNOLOGIES</strong>    There are many known technologies (some will be mentioned here) that work in some limited fashion but none that work consistently under all conditions. The Seeker is familiar with most known methods that exist today for this purpose. This Challenge is not about finding known technologies, but about finding new or repurposed technologies or adapting known technologies with new features to find voids below the surface. ¬†The Seeker would like to discover any technologies that exist that have not been tried to detect these voids previously. Your knowledge and experience in other areas applied to this problem is what is requested.  <p></p>  Previous efforts using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-penetrating_radar" target="_blank">Ground Penetrating Radar</a> (GPR), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_gradiometry" target="_blank">Gravity Gradiometer</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismometer" target="_blank">Seismic</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_acoustic_wave_sensor" target="_blank">Acoustic sensors</a> have produced limited capabilities due to geology/soil composition and the depth of some sinkholes. Some systems are effective in one geographical location and become useless in other locations. For example, it may work in wet but not dry soil, or in compact but not sandy soil. Many techniques can map a void when you already know something is there, but are not helpful in unknown areas. <p></p>   <strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong>    The Challenge is to come up with a system that can detect underground voids or sinkholes as deep as 30 feet below the surface (threshold) and preferably as deep as 100 feet below the surface (objective). The system must be able to detect voids in various types of geologies/soil compositions. Ideally it would provide a ‚Äúpicture‚Äù that shows the void and its location (GPS, Google Maps, or similar).    The system should have as small a footprint as possible (deployable from a vehicle) and easily set up and utilized with minimal training by non-technicians (surveyors, realtors, law enforcement, border patrol, etc.), not only scientists/specialists.  <p></p>  Submissions to this Challenge should try to meet the following <strong>Technical Requirements</strong>:  <ol>   <li>The system should be able to detect voids (empty space) as deep as 30 feet and preferably as deep as 100 feet.</li>   <li>The system should be able to detect spherical voids that are 6 feet in diameter and preferably as small as 2 feet in diameter. Note: Voids may take on many other shapes.</li>   <li>The system should be able to detect voids from a surface offset of at least 10 feet away and preferably up to 30 feet away.</li>   <li>The system should provide a picture of the void and location in some form (GPS coordinates, Google Map, or similar).</li>   <li>The system should be portable (by a vehicle) and have as small a foot-print as possible.</li>   <li>Ideally the system could be operated and interpreted by a non-scientist/specialist.</li>   <li>The system should work in all soil conditions (wet/dry, loose/compact, etc.), as well as in urban areas.</li>   <li>Preference will be given to those techniques not used for this purpose before and those techniques that have been used for this purpose but have some significant changes made by the Solver.</li>  </ol>
