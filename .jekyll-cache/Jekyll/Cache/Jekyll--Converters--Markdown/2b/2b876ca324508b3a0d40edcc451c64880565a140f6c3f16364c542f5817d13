I"+<p><strong>We are seeking new fish tracking capabilities that can significantly reduce costs and dramatically increase the effectiveness and efficiency of various fish recovery efforts led by federal, state, local, and/or other organizations. </strong>    <strong>Enter the competition: <a href="https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933646" target="_blank">https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933646</a></strong></p>
<p>The ability to track fish is central to efforts to recover threatened and endangered fish species and reduce impacts to at-risk species. Reliable, affordable detection and tracking provides vital information about how many fish are present, where and why mortality occurs, and where and why species thrive. This information enables fish recovery program managers to pursue targeted and more effective actions that can reduce mortality rates, improve habitat, and increase survival rates while continuing to meet Reclamation's mission.</p>
<p>Federal and non-federal resource managers require the ability to identify and monitor fish and other aquatic animals.  Fish, in particular, use different habitats, from small streams to deep fast-flowing rivers, and large lakes and oceans.  A common challenge faced by fish recovery managers is the need to monitor movements of free-swimming individual fish without repeated capture and handling.    https://youtu.be/mCw_1zhLybg  </p>
<p>  The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with other federal agencies (U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, NOAA-National Marine Fisheries Service, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) are looking for detailed concepts for the next generation of fish tracking methods, beyond what is available and in the literature today. Emphasis is on accurate tracking of many fish, ease of use, longevity, and low cost.  </p>
<p>  The goal of this Challenge is to generate new concepts for tracking fish that advance technologies that meet fish recovery program management needs at a reasonable cost.  A solution is being pursued through a prize competition because the Bureau of Reclamation and the collaborating federal agencies view it beneficial to seek innovative solutions from those beyond the usual sources of potential solvers and experts that commonly work in the fish recovery management domain. We find ourselves often wondering if somebody, somewhere may know a better way of tracking and monitoring fish for our purposes than the methods we currently use.</p>
<p>The prize competition approach enables us to reach a new source of potential Solvers to generate new and timely solutions that would not likely be accomplished by standard contractual methods.    <em>Submissions to this Challenge must be received by 11:59 PM (US Eastern Time) on August 26, 2015.  Late submissions will not be considered.</em>    </p>
<p><strong>This is an Ideation Challenge, which has the following unique features:</strong>  <ul>   <li><strong>There is a guaranteed award</strong>.  The awards will be paid to the best submission(s) <strong>as solely determined by the Seeker</strong>.  The total payout will be <strong>$20,000</strong>, with at least one award being no smaller than <strong>$5,000</strong> and no award being smaller than <strong>$2,500</strong>.</li>  </ul>  <ul>   <li>All intellectual property rights, if any, in the idea or concept demonstrated by the Proposed Solution will remain with the Solver.  UPON SUBMISSION OF a Proposed Solution to this Challenge, each Solver agrees to grant to the Seeker a ROYALTY-FREE, PERPETUAL, IRREVOCABLE, NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO USE by or on-behalf of the U.S. federal government ANY INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS PROPOSAL IN ANY FORUM, OR SUBSEQUENT EFFORTs TO FURTHER DEVELOP THE CONCEPT INTO A VIABLE SOLUTION and to allow others to do so. Notwithstanding granting the Seeker a perpetual, non-exclusive license for the PROPOSED SOLUTION, The Solver retains ownership of the IDEA OR CONCEPT DEMONSTRATED BY THE PROPOSED SOLUTION.</li>  </ul>  <ul>   <li>The Seeker believes there might be a potential for future collaboration with awarded Solver(s), although such collaboration is not guaranteed.  The Seeker may also encourage Solver(s) to further develop and test their winning submissions through subsequent round(s) of competition.  Solvers should make it clear if they have the ability for subsequent design and development phases and would be willing to consider future collaborations and/or subsequent competitions.</li>  </ul>  <ul>   <li>See the Challenge Specific Agreement and the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/07/27/2015-18157/announcement-of-requirements-and-registration-for-a-prize-competition-seeking-new-concepts-for">Federal Register Notice</a> for full details</li>  </ul>  After the Challenge deadline, the Seeker will evaluate the submissions  and make a decision with regards to the Winning Solution(s).  All Solvers that submitted a proposal will be notified on the status of their submissions; however, no detailed evaluation of individual submissions will be provided. </p>
<p>Decisions by the Seeker cannot be contested.</p>
