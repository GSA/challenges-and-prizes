Just as Sen. Harkin sought to expand ‚Äúwhat worked‚Äù throughout his career, we want these awards to encourage the development and expansion¬†of best practices in national service programming, improved project development, and increase the value of the AmeriCorps member experience to help tackle the country‚Äôs most pressing human and environmental needs through service. ¬†With emphases on engaging individuals with disabilities in service, program innovation and enhancements, and compelling AmeriCorps member experiences, the awards reflect the depth of impact of the national service field on the communities served and the individuals serving.    These awards will allow¬†the Corporation for National and Community Service¬†to share excellent program strategies and models with the national service field and the general public so that individuals, nonprofits, government agencies, schools, and more will be aware of the excellent and diverse range of national service programs across the country.    <em><strong>To submit a nomination, click on the Rules link on the left side of the page for instructions, frequently asked questions, and more.</strong></em></p>
