I"[<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is looking for innovative, effective, and replicable approaches to building a diverse and inclusive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce through partnerships. As an NSF initiative with a mission to enhance U.S. leadership in STEM by facilitating partnerships, NSF INCLUDES is sponsoring to the NSF STEM DIVE Challenge.</p>

<p>NSF invites grantees from all NSF programs to showcase, in the form of a short video (1 to 3 minutes), how forging partnerships, networks, or alliances has contributed to an increase in diversity and inclusion in STEM. All entries must be submitted by a Principal Investigator (PI) or Co-PI on any previous or current funded NSF award. These videos will be used by NSF and its programs in various platforms (e.g. websites, fair exhibitions, printed materials) to exhibit how grantees have encouraged and supported diversity and inclusion in STEM preK-12, higher, and informal education. This challenge is also designed to attract more broader interest in STEM and to inform the greater community on best practices for increasing diversity and inclusion, effective partnership and networking strategies, and dissemination approaches for growing the STEM workforce.</p>

<p>Entrants must be a PI or Co-PI of a current or expired National Science Foundation (NSF) grant or cooperative agreement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>May be an individual or a team of up to four people.</li>
  <li>Must be a U.S. citizens or permanent residents, or legal residents in the U.S. by June 24, 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>Employment requirements can be located at <em><a href="http://www.nsf.gov/ehr/stemdive.jsp">www.nsf.gov/ehr/stemdive.jsp</a></em></p>

<p>Cash prizes will be issued to the registered team leader. It is the team and team leader’s responsibility to determine whether and how prizes will be shared among team members and to implement such sharing arrangements.</p>

<p>In addition to cash prizes, winning videos will be posted on NSF’s Education Human Resources Directorate web page and the NSF INCLUDES National Network on <a href="https://www.includesnetwork.org/" target="_blank">https://www.includesnetwork.​org</a>. Should NSF decide to bring winning entrants to Washington, D.C., or to any other location for promotional and other purposes, expenses paid by NSF for entrants’ travel will be within the limits set forth in law according to federal travel regulations.</p>

<p>Videos will be judged on approach, impact and sustainability; visual appeal; effective communication; and originality.</p>

<p><strong>Key dates:</strong> The Challenge begins on March 24, 2020. All video entries must be uploaded to YouTube and written entries submitted by 11:00 p.m. ET on June 25, 2020.</p>
