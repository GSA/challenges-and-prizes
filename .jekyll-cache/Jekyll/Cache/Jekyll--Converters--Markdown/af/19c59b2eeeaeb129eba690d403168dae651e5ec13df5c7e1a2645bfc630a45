I"˙<p>‚ÄúIn his 2016 State of the Union Address, President Obama called upon the nation to harness the spirit of American innovation by identifying new ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer.‚Äù    ‚Äì Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office Michelle K. Lee  </p>
<p>  <strong>BACKGROUND¬†</strong> <br />   Cancer is undoubtedly a disease that touches all our lives. Ending cancer as we know it requires the formation of new alliances. As President Obama noted, getting this done isn‚Äôt just going to take the best and brightest across the medical, research, and data communities ‚Äî but millions of Americans owning a stake of it. By harnessing the power of patent data, and accelerating the process for protecting the intellectual property that lead to cancer immunotherapy breakthroughs, the USPTO is standing up and doing its part to help bring potentially life-saving treatments to patients, faster.  </p>
<p>  <strong style="line-height: 1.5;">THE CHALLENGE¬†</strong><br />   With data released through the <a href="https://developer.uspto.gov">USPTO Developer Hub</a>, users are¬†building rich visualizations of intellectual property data, an early indicator of meaningful innovation and research and development (R&amp;D), and combining this data with other state or agency data, such as census and bureau of labor statistics; and/or economic, and financial data. These types of visualizations demonstrate the power of telling complex stories that lead to impactful insights and ask why the data matter. </p>
<p>Similarly, we challenge you to create and illuminate new trend lines and interactive mappings of innovation with visualizations for all types of cancer treatments and diagnostics by combining our data with other unique data. Be sure to list the sources of your data sets (i.e. orange book data from FDA), tools and assumptions used to form your conclusion and visualizations. </p>
<p>Imagine your data visualizations will be the foundation to empower the federal government‚Äîas well as the medical, research, and data communities‚Äîto make more precise funding and policy decisions based on the commercialization lifecycle of the most promising treatments, while maximizing U.S. competitiveness in cancer investments.  </p>
<p>  Using analytic tools, processes and ¬†other interoperable data sets, we are challenging you to develop¬†interactive visualizations and stories that¬†can help reveal¬†new insights to¬†guide public policy and research to achieve the goal of doubling the rate of progress toward a cure.¬† For example, you could address questions such as:    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trending</span>:  <ul>    <li>What new insights can be revealed by correlating R&amp;D spending/funding to breakthrough technologies? How would you define or cluster the broad spectrum of cancer treatments, therapies and/or diagnostics?</li>    <li>What would trace studies of commercially successful treatments from patent to product tell us? What data insights can be gleaned from understanding the time it takes bring patents to patients?</li>    <li>What are the peaks and valleys in the landscape of cancer treatment technologies?</li>  </ul>  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Policy</span>:  <ul>    <li>If you were the Director of NIH or other agency, given what you have learned from this patent data and your research, how would you prioritize your cancer research budget? (FY2014 National Cancer Institute budget was $4.932 billion).</li>    <li>Based on cluster mapping of cancer treatments, therapies and/or diagnostics, what policy would you put in place to promote certain technologies? For example, would you promote treatment to make cancer a livable disease verses curing?</li>    <li>Is there any measurable relationship between patent data, clinical trial data and time to it takes for the technology to be in the hands of the patient. If so, how and what catalyst for innovation and policy changes would you advise the VPOTUS for the Cancer Moonshot.</li>  </ul>  <p style="line-height: 15.0pt; background: white; vertical-align: top; margin: 0in 0in 7.5pt 0in;"><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">RESOURCES</strong></p>  The USPTO has released a curated data set consisting of 269,353 patent documents (published patent applications and granted patents) spanning the 1976 to 2016 period.¬† This data and associated documentation explaining our methodology can be found on the <a href="https://developer.uspto.gov/product/cancer-moonshot-patent-data">USPTO Developer Hub</a>.    An online informational session was¬†held via Webex on 8/25/2016¬†at 3:00 PM EST. ¬†Please visit us at the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/events/cancer-moonshot-challenge-info-session">USPTO Cancer Moonshot Challenge Info Session</a>¬†page to see the answers¬†to your questions about the challenge and the USPTO Cancer Moonshot Patent data set.  </p>
