I"î<p>The U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon is a collegiate competition that challenges student teams to design and build highly efficient and innovative buildings powered by renewable energy. The winning teams will be those that best blend architectural and engineering excellence with creativity, market potential, building efficiency, and smart energy production.</p>

<p>The Solar Decathlon continues to ‚Äúpush the envelope‚Äù on the design of the high-performance, efficient, affordable, innovative buildings while leveraging opportunities to foster student innovation, STEM education, and workforce development opportunities.</p>

<p>Collegiate teams that compete in the annual Design Challenge create residential or commercial building designs that will be evaluated on how well they meet the nation‚Äôs rapidly evolving demand for innovative, cost-effective, quick-to-build, high-quality, resilient, grid-interconnected, efficient buildings that respond to targeted community needs. Beyond the residential and commercial building types that have been previously offered, the program is excited to add Retail Buildings to the mix. Teams can start planning now for the Solar Decathlon 2021 Design Challenge.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.solardecathlon.gov/event/challenges-design.html" target="_blank">2021 Design Challenge</a> will add a new contest focused on the lifecycle impacts of buildings. Teams are encouraged to reduce waste, pollution, and embodied carbon in their designs. In addition, teams should consider how buildings can be reused or repurposed at end-of-life. Partnerships with building owners are also encouraged to develop zero-energy designs for real building projects across the country and around the world.</p>

<p>Details about the Design Challenge are available on the <a href="https://www.solardecathlon.gov/2020/assets/pdfs/sd-design-challenge-rules.pdf" target="_blank">Solar Decathlon website</a>.</p>
