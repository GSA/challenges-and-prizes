<h4 id="the-background"><strong>The Background</strong></h4>

<p>Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are vital to understanding the complex needs of a patient. For this challenge, PRO data are defined as ‚Äúany report of the status of a patient‚Äôs health condition that comes directly from the patient, without interpretation of the patient‚Äôs response by a clinician or other medical expert.‚Äù In other words, PRO data come from patient self-assessments and look beyond the clinical data to assess how a patient feels about his or her health.</p>

<h4 id="the-problem"><strong>The Problem</strong></h4>

<p>While PRO data have proven useful to healthcare providers, they are not widely used in clinical settings. Recently, some digital tools have been developed to streamline the collection of PRO data. However, those digital tools are not widely adopted due to challenges related to clinician workflow and patient ease with the tools. Also, researchers who want to analyze PRO data across different practices or health systems often encounter the issue that data are not collected in a standardized manner. Creating a digital tool to efficiently collect, aggregate, and share PRO data is critical to advancing the quality of care.</p>

<h4 id="phase-1-winners"><strong>Phase 1 Winners</strong></h4>

<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Step Up App Challenge is seeking innovative technologists to develop user-friendly apps that collect standardized PRO data for clinical and research purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 1 winners announced:</strong></p>
