<h4 id="judging-panel-and-criteria">Judging Panel and Criteria</h4>

<p>A panel of federal employees serving as judges will review the prize competition submissions based on the following criteria:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>(40%) Impact</strong>:
A single approach or combination of approaches will be evaluated based on the magnitude and extent of impact seen on improving gender diversity at an institution and/or department. Consideration of faculty of intersecting identities, such as women of color, is encouraged in describing the impact to gender diversity. Impact can include qualitative elements like improvement of climate and inclusiveness of the environment.  Impact can also include quantitative improvements such as increased rates of female faculty recruitment, retention, and equitable pay across genders.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>(25%) Metrics</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>You must submit the following <strong>minimum metrics</strong> for the institution, school, division, or department in order to apply. This will ensure a common data set across all institutions.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gender baseline</strong>:  Aggregate faculty demographics for the institution, school, or department to which the approaches or interventions apply, at the pre-implementation stage.  Gender data should be provided in proportions and in absolute numbers.</li>
          <li><strong>Gender post implementation</strong>:  Aggregate faculty demographics for the institution, school, or department to which the approaches or interventions apply, at post-implementation or for the current landscape.  Data should be provided in proportions and in absolute numbers.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Data will be evaluated for its quality and strength, as well as synthesis and analysis in drawing specific conclusions.</li>
      <li>Data will be evaluated on whether it supports multiple elements of impact, as described in the Impact criterion above.</li>
      <li>The institutionâ€™s use of data analysis and data trends to reveal both gaps and improvements in gender diversity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>(15%) Sustainability</strong>: The extent to which effective efforts to enhance diversity at an institution can be regularly monitored, sustained, and are long lasting.</li>
  <li><strong>(10%) Scalability</strong>: The potential for approaches to be broadly implemented in other departments within the same institution, or be scaled up. The ease with which a process could be generalizable and adapted for different situations.</li>
  <li><strong>(10%) Lessons Learned</strong>:  The submission identifies lessons learned during implementation and clearly explains what challenges were faced and how they were addressed. Honest comments about roadblocks encountered are valuable.</li>
</ol>
