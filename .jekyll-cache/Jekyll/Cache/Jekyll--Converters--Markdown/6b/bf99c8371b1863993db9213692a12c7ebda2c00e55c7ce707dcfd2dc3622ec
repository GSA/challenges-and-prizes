<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submitted proposals go through a multi-step review process before the Humanitarian Grand Challenge Steering Committee makes a recommendation for funding. Grand Challenges Canada‚Äôs Board of Directors makes the final funding decisions. For more details: </span><a href="about:blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.grandchallenges.ca/who-we-are/our-people/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>    <b>ELIGIBILITY</b><strong>¬†CRITERIA</strong>  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligible applicants include social enterprises and other recognized institutions (e.g., non-profit organizations and for-profit companies) that are formed and legally incorporated, that can successfully execute the activities in their respective technical area, and that are capable of receiving and administering grant funding. Sole proprietorships are not eligible for funding. ¬†United Nations country offices are not eligible to apply. </span>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">A project can have only one Project Lead, who must be affiliated with the institution from which the proposal is being submitted.</span>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">A Project Lead may only be listed on one (1) application to this Request for Proposals. An institution may be the applicant on multiple applications, provided all applications have different Project Leads.</span>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications must include all required information. Only complete applications will be considered by the Review Committee.</span>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners may, at any time and at their sole discretion, modify eligibility criteria with respect to individual applicants, Project Leads and/or eligible countries, to the extent that such modifications do not materially undermine the review process. (See Section 5.4.)</span>&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  <b>Please note </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">that Grand Challenges Canada must approve any changes in applicant organization, institution or Project Lead from the originally-funded grant.</span>  &lt;h3&gt;<strong>APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS</strong>&lt;/h3&gt;  <b>Submitting an Application/Letter of Intent</b>    <b>There are two distinct submission streams:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†one for seed (via application form) and one for Transition To Scale (via Letter of Intent).</span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Both seed applications and Transition To Scale Letters of Intent</span> <b>MUST BE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> submitted through Grand Challenges Canada‚Äôs Community Portal (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gcc.fluxx.io</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span>    <b>In order to gain access to the Portal, applicants must first create an account using the following link: </b><a href="https://gcc.fluxx.io/lois/new?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;commit=Create+an+account+now"><b>Create an account</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Applications that do not meet the eligibility criteria will be removed from the competition.</span>    <b>Innovation Screen  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seed applications/Transition To Scale Letters of Intent will be scored internally against the criteria below, using responses to application/Letter of Intent questions in the ‚ÄúProject Summary‚Äù section. The two criteria are equally weighted.</span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: The innovation screen will not evaluate the feasibility or quality of the project plan.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (That evaluation will be done at a later stage in the process.) Proposals that lack innovation and relevance will be removed from the competition at this stage. </span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovation Screen criteria:</span>  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<b>Innovation</b>  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the proposed idea clearly articulated? </span>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Does the innovation represent more than an incremental improvement over current approaches?</span>&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<b>Relevance</b>  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Does the proposed solution address the specific problem under the Humanitarian Grand Challenge, as described in Sections 2.1 and 2.2?</span>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Does the proposed solution target vulnerable people who are hard to reach and affected by conflict, as described in Section 2.3?</span>&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  <span style="font-weight: 400;">At Transition To Scale level, the most promising Letters of Intent will be invited to submit a full Transition To Scale application for due diligence by the Review Committee.</span>    <b>Review Committee Screen  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">For proposals that pass the Eligibility and Innovation screens, a Review Committee of scientific, social and business reviewers, including humanitarian experts and affected people, will advise on the merit of proposals, based on the evaluation criteria in Sections 4.4 and 4.5.</span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposals will be ranked in four lists, one for each area of interest outlined in Section 2.2. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the quality of proposals received, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> retain the right to narrow the focus to one or more of the four areas.</span>    <b>Transition To Scale Due Diligence  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following review of Transition To Scale Letters of Intent, ¬†those invited to submit full Transition To Scale proposals will undergo extensive due diligence on potential for impact, operations, finances, technical parameters, intellectual property, partnerships, gender equality, environment sustainability, and human rights and inclusion. (See Section 4.5 for full Transition to Scale evaluation criteria.) Due diligence may include interviews with applicants, partners, advisors and third-party stakeholders. </span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding recommendations will be made based on findings from the extensive due diligence process. Grand Challenges Canada, on a case-by-case basis and in consultation with the Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners, may choose to recommend applicants who do not meet all the Investment Criteria for funding of a lesser amount to focus on a few key areas necessary to transition to scale. To inform final decision-making, Grand Challenges Canada will draft a recommendation that explains the rationale for funding and will work with the innovator to refine and structure the investment during the due diligence process. At its discretion, Grand Challenges Canada may choose not to put forward applicants for a funding decision, due to information that arises in due diligence or any perceived weaknesses based on the Investment Criteria.</span>    <b>Funding Decisions (Seed)  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the results of the review committee, the Humanitarian Grand Challenge Steering Committee will make a funding recommendation to the Board of Directors of Grand Challenges Canada, which will make the final funding decisions at the Board‚Äôs sole discretion, including its reserved rights set out in Section 4.13. Only projects rated as fundable by the Review Committee may be recommended for funding. Due diligence is taken into account for all projects recommended by Review Committee for funding. Based on the results of the Review Committee or due diligence process, refinements to the proposed project plan, structure, amount, type of funding and oversight may be required during the negotiation of a funding agreement.</span>    <b>Funding Decisions (Transition To Scale)  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final funding decisions are made by Grand Challenges Canada‚Äôs Board of Directors.

If you have any doubts about the wisdom of disclosure of confidential or proprietary information (including information related to inventions), we recommend you consult with your legal counsel and take any steps you deem necessary to protect your intellectual property.</span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">You may wish to consider whether such information is critical for evaluating the submission and whether more general, non-confidential information may be adequate as an alternative for these purposes.</span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Grand Challenges Canada expressly disclaims any and all liability that may arise from disclosure of confidential information contained in Submission Materials.</span>    <b>Warranty  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">By providing any Submission Materials, the applicant(s) represent and warrant that they have the right to provide the information submitted and to grant the above licenses.</span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Applicants with questions concerning the contents of their Submission Materials may contact us by email at </span><a href="mailto:humanitarian.gc@grandchallenges.ca"><span style="font-weight: 400;">humanitarian.gc@grandchallenges.ca</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>    <b>Intellectual Property (IP)  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solutions supported by this program comprise innovative technologies, services, business models, knowledge and/or products to promote humanitarian action in conflict-affected contexts. In order to ensure meaningful access for target populations, the successful development and deployment of these solutions may require involvement by, support of and/or collaboration with multiple organizations, including the private sector, government and academic and/or non-profit research institutions. Accordingly, it is the intent of this program to support the formation of appropriate partnerships that are essential to meet these urgent global health needs.</span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Successful applicants retain ownership of intellectual property rights in supported innovations, including those rights that arise in outputs of funded projects. Grand Challenges Canada aims, however, to ensure that any such intellectual property rights are utilized and managed in a manner that is consistent with achieving the goals of this program. Grand Challenges Canada‚Äôs Global Access Policy will guide our approach to intellectual property, and we urge all applicants to consider their willingness to submit an application in compliance with Grand Challenges Canada‚Äôs Global Access Policy.</span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Successful applicants will be required to commit to compliance with Grand Challenges Canada‚Äôs Global Access Policy and to sign a Global Access Agreement with Grand Challenges Canada, in line with the Guiding Principles, applicable to the innovative solutions and project outputs supported by this program. The Global Access Agreement will provide a non-exclusive license to intellectual property rights in supported innovations (including background intellectual property) permitting Grand Challenges Canada and its funding partners and its sub-licensees to implement and disseminate products, processes, knowledge or solutions in low- and middle-income countries in which applicants or their partners are unable to achieve meaningful accessibility. Applicants should note that Grand Challenges Canada may be required to provide sub-license or sub-distribution rights to the funding partners, or one or more persons appointed by the funding partners. Applicants should note that the above global access commitments survive the end of project activities.</span>    <b>Data Access  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grand Challenges Canada is committed to optimizing the use of data to translate knowledge into life-saving solutions. To fulfill this objective, data must be made widely and rapidly available to Grand Challenges Canada‚Äôs research community and the broader humanitarian community through ethical and efficient data access practices. In accordance with global access, data access represents an elaboration of the second guiding principle of the Global Access Policy, which states that knowledge gained through discovery is broadly, and as promptly as possible, distributed between related projects and to the global scientific community.</span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">At a minimum, ‚Äòdata‚Äô refers to final, annotated quantitative and qualitative datasets, and accompanying information, such as metadata, codebooks, data dictionaries, questionnaires and protocols.</span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Grand Challenges Canada recognizes the value of intellectual property and commercialization, and the benefits of first and continuing use of data, but not prolonged or exclusive use. In some cases, intellectual property protection, laws or regulations may delay or preclude access to data. In such cases, the grantee will provide justification to warrant a partial or complete waiver of the data access requirement.</span>    <b>Rights of Grand Challenges Canada  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Request for Proposals is part of a discretionary granting program. Submission of an application does not create a contractual relationship between the applicant and Grand Challenges Canada.</span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Grand Challenges Canada reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without notice, to:</span>  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancel this Request for Proposals at any time and for any reason.</span>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Amend and reissue the Request for Proposals at any time and for any reason.

We recommend checking for any revisions to the Request for Proposals prior to the submission of your application.</span>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Accept or reject any application that is non-conforming because it does not meet the eligibility criteria, does not comply with the application instructions and/or does not comply with the instructions for allowable costs.</span>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not award an application based on performance on a previous Grand Challenges Canada grant or project, or based on the award of a grant to the applicant for the same or similar research by one of Grand Challenges Canada‚Äôs partners or collaborating institutions.</span>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Disqualify any application at any stage where there is an indication that the proposal was, in any way, plagiarized.</span>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Accept or reject any or all applications, regardless of an application‚Äôs ranking, based on the evaluation criteria, with or without providing an explanation.</span>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Award applications with different funding amounts, different durations and/or different conditions than set out above.</span>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Verify any information provided by applicants through independent research or by contacting third parties deemed to be reliable by Grand Challenges Canada, and use that information to inform Grand Challenges Canada‚Äôs funding decision.</span>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide grants in collaboration with funding partners. This may involve separate grant agreements with each institution (i.e., one with Grand Challenges Canada and one with a partner institution), as well as distinct transfers of funds. Any such funding may be subject to terms and conditions beyond those described herein. Grand Challenges Canada reserves the right to negotiate for</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">any additional IP requirements/terms and conditions of any Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners.</span>&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  <b>Research Assurances  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted above in Section 2.10, it is the policy of Grand Challenges Canada that research involving human subjects, research with animals and research subject to additional regulatory requirements must be conducted in accordance with the highest internationally-recognized ethical standards. In order to receive funds from Grand Challenges Canada, initially and throughout the course of a research project, researchers must affirm and document compliance with the guiding ethical principles and standards outlined below:</span>  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Research involving human participants must be conducted in a manner that demonstrates, protects and preserves respect for persons, concern for the welfare of individuals, families and communities, and justice</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b9U264gHuMQeCKElKJkiRzMFN9k0w2iCcWtiKnl497w/edit#heading=h.3q5sasy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Research involving animals must be conducted in a manner that ensures their humane care and treatment.</span>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain research endeavours, including but not limited to research with recombinant DNA, biohazards and genetically modified organisms, may be subject to enhanced regulation and oversight.</span>&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  <span style="font-weight: 400;">As applicable to the individual project, Grand Challenges Canada will require that, for each venue in which any part of the project is conducted (either by your institution or a sub-grantee or subcontractor), all legal and regulatory approvals for the activities being conducted will be obtained in advance of commencing the regulated activity. We will further require you to agree that no funds will be expended to enroll human subjects until the necessary regulatory and ethical bodies‚Äô approvals are obtained.
