I"M<div class="rules"> <p><strong>Eligibility Rules for Participating in the Competition:&nbsp; </strong></p> <p><em><strong>The I-FAST Competition is open to teams (“Teams” or “Participants”) that are made up of individuals from  academic/university institutions that have received a prior award from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) (in a scientific or engineering field relevant to the proposed innovation) that is currently active or that has been active within five years from the date of the I-FAST Team’s proposal submission.</strong></em></p> <p>The lineage of the prior award extends to the PI, Co-PIs, Senior Personnel, Post Docs, Professional Staff or others who were supported under the NIFA award. The prior award could range from a modest single-investigator award to a large, distributed center and also includes awards involving students.</p> <p>To be eligible to win a prize under the Competition, Teams:&nbsp; </p> <ul> <li>Shall have registered to participate in the Competition under the rules;</li>    <li>Shall have complied with all the requirements of the Competition rules;</li> <li>May not include a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment; and</li> <li>In the case of a private entity Team member, the member shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States. In the case of an individual Team member, shall be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States.</li> </ul> <p>Makeup of I-FAST Competition Teams:&nbsp; Each Team shall consist of three members:</p> <ul> <li>Entrepreneurial Lead (EL)</li> <li>I-FAST Team Mentor</li> <li>Principal Investigator (PI)</li> </ul> <p>I-FAST teams are made up of individuals from an academic/university institution except for the Mentor who may reside with an outside organization as described below.</p> <p>The Entrepreneurial Lead (EL) could be a postdoctoral scholar, graduate, or other student with relevant knowledge of the technology located at the academic/university institution and a deep commitment to investigate the commercial landscape surrounding the innovation. The EL should also be capable and have the will to support the transition of the technology, should the I-FAST Team’s project demonstrate the potential for commercial viability. The EL will be responsible for:&nbsp; 1) developing the team to include the mentor and PI, 2) leading the development of the pre-application, participating in the I-FAST interviews and developing the full application, if selected, 3) starting and completing all training activities in the Entrepreneurial Immersion course provided by the NSF I-Corps program, 4) communicating and coordinating with team members to achieve the goals of the team, 5) developing and monitoring team activity milestones from the Entrepreneurial Immersion course, 6) ensuring the team milestones are completed on time, and 7) ensuring the team is in communication with the NIFA I-FAST Competition Director and the NSF I-Corps Program Director as needed.</p> <p>The I-FAST Teams Mentor will typically be an experienced or emerging entrepreneur with proximity to the academic/university institution and have experience in transitioning technology out of the academic arena. The Mentor should be selected as a third-party resource, or may be a person that has an established relationship with the team (e.g., Board Member), but cannot be an employee nor directly involved with the technology development. Ideally, the Industry Expert should have prior experience developing and commercializing other products within the broader technology space related to the specific project under development. The EL will need to identify a Mentor that has business expertise in the proposed technology sector and has entrepreneurial experience. A Mentor will be someone with the right “rolodex” of contacts in the technology area of commercialization which are critical for “getting the technology out of the university.” The EL of the team should contact their University Technology Transfer Office for ideas of potential Mentors. The I-FAST Team’s Mentor will be responsible for guiding the team forward using existing entrepreneurial experience and tracking the team’s progress through regular communication with the EL, PI, the NIFA I-FAST competition director, and the NSF I-Corps Program Director, as needed.</p> <p>The PI will have in-depth knowledge of the innovation developed under the earlier USDA NIFA Grant and will be responsible for:&nbsp; 1) coordinating with the university on the transfer of prize funds from NIFA, if the team is selected, 2) tracking of the prize funding for team activities, 3) reporting to NIFA on disbursements and obligations of the prize funding, 4) guiding the EL and Mentor on technical aspects of the innovation, 5) communicating as needed with the NIFA I-FAST Competition Director and the NSF I-Corps Program Director, 6) ensuring the EL meets the required milestones for the NSF I-CORP training, and 7) participating as a team member.  The Principal Investigator who received the earlier NIFA grant for the technology is allowed to participate on the team, but cannot be the Entrepreneurial Lead.</p> <p>During the I-Corps course, each participating team, including all its team members, will be required to:&nbsp; </p> <ul> <li>Attend, in person, an evening reception and 3-day kick-off Entrepreneurial Immersion course;</li> <li>Conduct approximately 100 customer interviews over the 6-week program, and submit interview summary reports. This process of customer discovery “outside the building” is expected to require a minimum of 15 hours per week for at least five weeks;</li> <li>Participate in 5 weekly webinar sessions and submit regular updates to the team’s business model canvas. In addition, it is expected that I-Corps teams will take advantage of instructor office hours; and</li> <li>Attend, in person, the final 2-day course close out/lessons learned session (to be held in the same region as the kick-off course).</li> </ul> <p>If one or more team members cannot meet these requirements, the team should not pursue the program.</p> </div>
