I"<p>This prize competition will be run in two phases; participants may submit a solution in Phase 2 even if they did not participate in Phase 1. Phase 1 is a design phase that asks participants to submit their ideas and solutions related to renal replacement therapy. Up to 15 Phase 1 winners will be selected, with each eligible Phase 1 winning submission receiving a $75,000 cash prize. Winners may also be invited to present their ideas at an open public meeting with an audience expected to include stakeholders from across government, investors, patients, industry representatives, academics, and non-profit organizations. Eligibility rules are described in "Terms and Conditions."&nbsp;<em><strong>Participants do not have to submit a Phase 1 entry in order to submit a Phase 2 entry.</strong></em></p>
<h4>Phase 1: Design</h4>
<p>Phase 1 participants should ensure that their submission provides sufficient detail and information to allow judges to evaluate the submission in accordance with the following Phase 1 evaluation criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Potential to significantly improve or add to the landscape of solutions to manage kidney failure
<ul>
<li>Clearly demonstrates a vision for medical product development, which should include a clear articulation of the problem being addressed/solved.</li>
<li>Clearly demonstrates that the proposed design includes new components, technologies, or approaches that have not previously been part of renal replacement therapies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nature and extent of anticipated benefit(s) to patients,
<ul>
<li>Clearly demonstrates efforts to incorporate patient feedback into the design</li>
<li>Clearly addresses one or more of the &ldquo;Improving Patient Quality of Life&rdquo; objectives discussed in Section D, above</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Feasibility of producing a functional prototype (including scientific and technological rigor)
<ul>
<li>Clear descriptions of technological or scientific needs, if any, for potential development of a prototype (e.g., what gaps in the proposed solution exist, how might your design fit with existing approaches to create a solution, where do you need additional input?), to better inform and position HHS and ASN to offer assistance if appropriate</li>
<li>Clear explanation of additional challenges or potential pitfalls that need to be considered or addressed</li>
<li>Feasibility of development milestones over one year</li>
<li>Feasibility of regulatory approval of the proposed solution</li>
<li>Clear explanation of the knowledge or expertise the participant/participant team brings to the development of the proposed solution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quality of evidence supporting the design</li>
</ol>
<h4>Phase Two: Prototype Demonstration&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Phase 2 of the prize competition asks participants to build their proposed solution into a prototype. <em><strong>Participants may also submit a prototype solution in Phase 2 even if they have not submitted a design solution in Phase 1.</strong> </em>At the end of Phase 2, judges will review submissions and an authorized official will select up to 3 winners, with each eligible winning submission receiving a cash prize of $500,000. Eligibility rules are described in "Terms and Conditions."</p>
<p>Phase 2 participants should ensure that their submission provides sufficient detail and information to allow judges to evaluate the submission in accordance with the following Phase 2 evaluation criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Demonstration of at least the first iteration of a prototype solution whose function addresses one or more elements of the prize competition scope described in Section D, above (testing in animals or humans is not required, but some demonstration or documentation of the prototype&rsquo;s operating capacity is necessary).</li>
<li>Demonstration of patient input in the design of the prototype.
<ul>
<li>Degree to which input from patients has informed the development of the prototype</li>
<li>Estimated patient quality of life impact if the prototype solution were to be broadly implemented</li>
<li>Prototype addresses one or more of the "Improving Patient Quality of Life" objectives discussed in Section D, above</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Degree of innovation from past approaches or solutions</li>
<li>Potential for prototype to significantly advance towards readiness for animal or human studies (if applicable)
<ul>
<li>Long-term vision for product development of the prototype solution, including potential pathways for commercialization</li>
<li>Collaborations or planned collaborations, if any, with industry or other entities (participants may choose not to disclose all such collaborations if they wish)</li>
<li>Next steps and potential challenges envisioned/proposed for product development, potentially including gaps in existing technologies, manufacturing, regulatory, or payment hurdles (the purpose of this information is to better inform and position HHS and ASN to offer assistance if appropriate)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solutions must address at least one of the following areas</strong> (additional details about current technical and scientific needs can be found in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/idealab/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/KidneyX-Redesign-Dialysis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Section F of the prize announcement</a>, as well as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asn-online.org/membership/BlastEmails/files/NEW_KHIRRTRoadmap_081418_DraftforPublicComment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kidney Health Initiative&rsquo;s "Technology Roadmap for Innovative Approaches to Renal Replacement Therapy</a>."):</p>
