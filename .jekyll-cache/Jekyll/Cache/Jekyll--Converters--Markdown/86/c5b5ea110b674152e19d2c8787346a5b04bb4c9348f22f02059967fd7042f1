I"@%<p>Each Participant (individual Participant, team of Participants, or commercial entity) shall submit one entry in response to this Challenge. Team or commercial entity entries must identify one individual as a primary point of contact (POC) and prize recipient. By submitting an entry, a Participant authorizes his or her name to be released to the media if the Participant wins the prize.</p>

<p>While reading this section, it may be helpful to refer to the “How to Enter” section, which itemizes the detailed requirements of a submission package. The “How to Enter” section provides instructions for submitting the package.</p>

<p>This Challenge will be conducted in two successive phases.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 1</strong> 
The Phase 1 submission package will provide the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Submission description White-paper (document);</li>
  <li>Overview and Demonstration videos (each less than 10 minutes long);</li>
  <li>The SOAR technology itself (via VM, hardware, and/or any included and necessary software); and,</li>
  <li>A setup guide (document). See Submission Requirements below for the specifics of each submission component.</li>
</ol>

<p>Phase 1 will be used to identify the most promising candidate technologies that will be selected for and advanced to Phase 2 evaluation. These selections will be based on the technology’s Whitepaper document plus the Overview and Demonstration videos. SOAR tool submitters must be available during Phase 1 for any questions by the U.S. Navy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) teams.</p>

<p>PMW 130 will notify all Contestants that advance to Phase 2 using the contact information provided in the submission. The Government, may, but is not necessarily required to, notify Contestants that do not advance.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 2</strong>
Phase 2 will involve more in-depth evaluation of candidate technologies by subject matter experts at ORNL and actual SOC operators from both ORNL and the U.S. Navy. It will require a fifth and final submission component, namely (5) a User Tutorial video. Upon notification of selection for Phase 2, further instructions and a deadline will be provided to only the selected technologies for the (5) User Tutorial video.</p>

<p>In addition, technical assistance to ORNL’s team is expected for ensuring expedient and proper set-up of the submitted SOAR tool into ORNL’s environment during Phase 2. Remote support (video- or tele-conferences) will be scheduled with the submission team’s technical point of contact (POC) specified in the Phase 1 submission package.</p>

<p>Once technologies are appropriately configured, Phase 2 evaluation will commence. Phase 2 will include a hands-on test of the SOAR tool, conducted by multiple SOC operators, while red-team attack campaigns are administered. The environment will include relevant background traffic and real users populating the test network. Tests involving collaboration of multiple operators using the SOAR tool may be conducted, both for operators working in the same network SOC and when handing off investigations to operators in a different network’s SOC.</p>

<p>Expertise of SOC analysts is particularly important and relevant to Phase 2, and access to SOC expertise is limited; consequently, Phase 2 will be evaluated on a smaller subset of Phase 1 Participants. Additional tests of each SOAR tool, to measure further quantitative and qualitative metrics, will be performed by ORNL research staff.</p>
