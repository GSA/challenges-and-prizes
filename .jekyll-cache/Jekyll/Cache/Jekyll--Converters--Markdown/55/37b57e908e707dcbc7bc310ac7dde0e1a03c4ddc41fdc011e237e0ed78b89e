I"3<p>We are seeking to rapidly solicit academic research in the form of case studies about the space domain for use in classroom instruction. As part of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force’s priorities on space education, <a href="https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/">Air University</a> (AU) at Maxwell Air Force Base seeks case studies relating to the space domain, from sources outside of the Department of Defense. The anticipated outcome is to expose AU to non-military professionals’ thought relating to the space domain.</p>
