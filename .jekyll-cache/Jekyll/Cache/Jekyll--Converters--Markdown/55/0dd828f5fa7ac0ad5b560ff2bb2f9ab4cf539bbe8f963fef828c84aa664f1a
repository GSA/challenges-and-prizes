I"©<p>The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) are launching a collaborative Data Visualization Challenge in support of the U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) Digital Strategy. This Challenge seeks data visualizations capable of expanding the use and understanding of publicly available criminal justice data.    In an effort to increase not only the transparency, but also the accessibility of these valuable sources of government data, NIJ and BJS are seeking ideas for, and development of, data visualization applications. A well-developed data visualization product can make it easier for the public, researchers, and policymakers to understand the data. These applications should enhance public access to, and understanding of, criminal justice information in ways that will address our current needs to access data in a readily understood format, from anywhere, at any time, from any device.</p>
