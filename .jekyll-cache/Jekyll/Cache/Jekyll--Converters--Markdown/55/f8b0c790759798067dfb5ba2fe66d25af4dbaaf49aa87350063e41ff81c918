I"J}<h4>1. CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION</h4>
<p>These Official Rules, Terms &amp; Conditions (“Official Rules”) apply to the 2015-2016 Partnership for Freedom’s Rethink Supply Chains Challenge (the “Challenge”), sponsored by Humanity United (referred to herein as “the Partnership” or “HU”) and administered by Luminary Labs, LLC (“Luminary Labs”). Please read these Official Rules carefully before entering the Challenge, since you must comply with these Official Rules in all regards to be eligible to win any prize.    The Challenge calls upon developers, designers, advocates, and innovators to submit concepts for technological solutions that help businesses, workers, governments, or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) identify, prevent, and eradicate labor trafficking and/or forced labor practices from the supply chain for goods and services. For the purposes of this challenge, labor trafficking and /or forced labor practices include forced labor, slavery, the worst forms of child labor, and human trafficking, defined as the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion, for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.    Specific areas of focus and potential objectives for submissions to address are included within the Challenge Details page of the Website (www.partnershipforfreedom.org/rethinksupplychains). Submission(s) may either address one of these Challenge areas or propose an alternate objective relating to identifying, preventing, or eradicating labor trafficking and/or forced labor practices in supply chains for goods and services.    The Challenge will be conducted in four phases:  &lt;ol&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Challenge launch and open submission period (“Open Submission Period”);&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Judging of submissions and selection of finalists;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Finalist Accelerator (inclusive of Finalist mentorship and Finalist Boot Camp) (“Finalist Accelerator Phase”); and&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Grand Prize Application, final judging and selection of Grand Prize winner and Grand Prize Runner-Up winner.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  During the Challenge Open Submission Period, any individual, team, or entity (“Entrant” or “Entrants”) that desires to participate in the Challenge must make a submission via the Luminary Lightbox<sup>TM</sup>platform, accessed through the Partnership for Freedom website. The submission should contain a description of the technological solution, the issue the technology solution will address, and generally how the solution will address that issue. Entrants should complete the submission form, including uploads of required documents and completion of the submission checklist.    Following the close of the Open Submission Period, up to five eligible submissions will be selected by a panel of judges appointed at the sole discretion of the Partnership (“Judges”) as finalist submissions (“Finalist”), based on evaluation of the submissions under the criteria set forth in these Official Rules. If the Judges determine that no submission sufficiently satisfies the criteria for the Challenge, then no submission will be chosen. To qualify as a Finalist, the submission must be chosen by the Judges, the Finalist must be qualified to enter in compliance with these Official Rules, and each Finalist must agree to the terms and conditions of the Master Challenge Agreement in all regards.    Qualifying Finalists will be awarded a cash prize of $20,000 to further develop their concept in the Finalist Accelerator Phase, where there will be the opportunity to receive assistance and to participate in an in-person Finalist Boot Camp. Finalists are encouraged to use their $20,000 award to improve upon their submission concept during the Finalist Accelerator Phase with the goal of submitting an application for the Challenge’s Grand Prize or Runner-Up Grand Prize. At the end of the Finalist Accelerator Phase, each Finalist will have the opportunity to submit a Grand Prize Application consisting of an updated description of the concept, an overview of how the concept evolved during the Finalist Accelerator Phase, a demonstration of the prototype, an implementation timeline to build out the prototype into a deployable solution within 12 months of the Challenge, key learnings during the Finalist Accelerator Phase.    From among the Grand Prize Application submissions, one (1) Grand Prize winner and one (1) Grand Prize Runner-Up winner will be selected. The Grand Prize is an award of $250,000 to further develop the concept set forth in the Grand Prize Application, and the Grand Prize Runner-Up award is $50,000 to further develop the concept set forth in the Grand Prize Runner-Up winner’s Grand Prize Application.  Both a Grand Prize winner and a Grand Prize Runner-Up winner will be chosen only if two submissions meet all judging criteria and otherwise conform to the Official Rules and the Master Challenge Agreement.  &lt;h4&gt;2.

The judging will be based and scored upon the Judges’ evaluation of each submission received during the Open Submission Period according to the following evaluation criteria (“Finalist Evaluation Criteria”):    <strong>Finalist Evaluation Criteria:</strong>  &lt;ol&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Feasibility:</strong> Likelihood that the proposed solution can be developed into a prototype by the end of the Challenge and into a deployable solution within twelve (12) months of Challenge completion.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Usability:</strong> Degree to which the solution is designed to meet the needs of its target audience and incorporates the principles of user-centered design, in which the needs, wants, and limitations of end users of the solution are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Scalability:</strong> Ability of solution to be replicated or commercialized within or across industries, geographies, and/or audiences.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Commitment:</strong> Demonstrated ability of Entrant to develop and implement and commercialize the concept.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Impact:</strong> Ability of the solution to make meaningful and measurable progress in identifying, preventing, or eradicating labor trafficking and/or forced labor practices in supply chains for goods and services.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  Submissions may be targeted towards a specific sector or geographic region, and/or any intervention point in a supply chain for goods or services.    While submissions during the Open Submission Period may be conceptual, the successful concept will be capable of becoming a prototype by the time of the Grand Prize Application, with the prototype further evolving into a deployable solution within twelve (12) months of the announcement date of the Challenge’s Grand Prize winner and Grand Prize Runner-Up winner.    <strong>Grand Prize Evaluation Criteria</strong>    The Grand Prize Evaluation Criteria, which the Judges will use to determine the Grand Prize winner and Grand Prize Runner-Up winner, include the Finalist Evaluation Criteria as well as the following additional criteria:  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Willingness and ability to participate in the Finalist Accelerator.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Demonstration of ability to effectively iterate and improve the concept into a prototype.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Demonstration of ability to create a deployable solution within twelve (12) months.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  All decisions of the Judges, upon approval of the Partnership, are final and binding and in their sole discretion.    By participating in the Challenge, each Entrant – whether an individual, a team of individuals or entities, or an entity- acknowledges and agrees to be bound by and not to challenge the decisions of the Judges.    When notification of Finalists and/or Grand Prize winner and Grand Prize Runner-Up winner is completed, or as soon as is practical thereafter, abstracts of the Finalists submissions and/or Grand Prize winner and Grand Prize Runner-Up winner, as applicable, may be posted on the Challenge website.  No public announcement of scores or evaluations of any type by Judges will be posted or available. Individual feedback on submissions or applications will not be provided other than to Finalists eligible to participate in the Finalist Accelerator Phase.  &lt;h4&gt;7. AVAILABLE PRIZE AWARDS&lt;/h4&gt;  The total available prize pool for the Challenge includes $400,000 in prizes and up to $100,000 of anticipated in kind support, the form and amount of which is to be determined and provided by the Partnership in its sole discretion. From the $400,000 Challenge prize pool, up to five Finalists will be awarded $20,000 following the judging of open submissions. Finalists will have the opportunity to improve and iterate upon their submissions and to develop a prototype during the Finalist Accelerator Phase. After the Finalist Accelerator Phase, Grand Prize Applications shall be submitted. The same Judges will select one (1) Grand Prize winner to receive a $250,000 grant and one (1) Grand Prize Runner-Up winner to receive a $50,000 grant. The Partnership reserves the right to disburse the Grand Prize and Grand Prize Runner-Up awards over the course of one or more payments, which payments may track milestones and achievements in improving and deploying the submission.
