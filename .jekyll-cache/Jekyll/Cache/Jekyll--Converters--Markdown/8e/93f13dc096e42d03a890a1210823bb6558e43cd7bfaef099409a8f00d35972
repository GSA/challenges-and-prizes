I"q<p>Weather data is vital to the U.S. military, impacting missions worldwide. The need to collect atmospheric data in numerous remote areas around the world is never going away. This challenge is to design a man-portable system that is capable of collecting atmospheric data from ground level to 10,000 ft. above ground level (AGL). This data needs to be downloaded to a portable computer that that operator will be carrying with them. This system cannot use an external gas source (gas not present in situ and/or naturally present in operating environment that needs to be carried in such as Helium tanks) to lift the sensor to altitude since these gases are not readily available and expensive.    Technical merit: Proposals will be evaluated based on the systemâ€™s ability to meet the most or all of the threshold requirements listed in the Rules section of this challenge.</p>
