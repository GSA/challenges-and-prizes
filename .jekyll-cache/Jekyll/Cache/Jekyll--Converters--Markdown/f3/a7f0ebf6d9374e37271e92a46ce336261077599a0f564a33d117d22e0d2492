I"#<p>We invite MRC volunteers to enter the “MRC Serves!” Video Challenge. MRC volunteers can create and submit a short 60 to 90 second video that answers one of the following three questions.  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Why do I/we volunteer with the MRC?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;How does the MRC make my community healthier?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;How does the MRC make my community more prepared and resilient?&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  Be creative when answering these questions. Submit a video as an individual or as a team. The video can include visuals such as footage or pictures (see the Rules section for restrictions) of an MRC activity or event you participated in.  We encourage you to wear MRC gear such as shirts and hats! Your video could encourage others to volunteer with the MRC.</p>
