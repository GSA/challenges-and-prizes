<p><strong>**Important Update:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Due to the overwhelming interest and submissions for the “HHS Hypertension Innovator Award Competition,” we are delaying the announcement of Phase 1 winners until July 2021.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), Office on Women’s Health (OWH) is seeking innovative ways to ensure women with hypertension during pregnancy and/or postpartum receive appropriate monitoring and follow-up through the HHS Hypertension Innovator Award Competition:  Innovative Methods of Blood Pressure Monitoring and Follow-up in Women during Pregnancy and/or Postpartum.</p>

<h4 id="backgroundissue">Background/Issue</h4>

<p>The HHS Office on Women’s Health (OWH) is charged with providing expert advice and consultation to the Secretary on scientific, legal, ethical, and policy issues, and serving as a coordination point throughout HHS on issues affecting the health of women and girls. OWH establishes short and long-term goals within the Department for research, disease prevention and health promotion, service delivery, and education for public health and health care professionals surrounding women and girls’ health. OWH identifies needs and monitors activities within the Department that contribute to women and girls’ health and through leadership of the Coordinating Committee on Women’s Health. Additionally, OWH is responsible for facilitating the exchange of information through the National Women’s Health Information Center and promoting women and girls’ health programs and policies, all aimed at improving the health of women and girls.</p>

<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr60/nvsr60_03.pdf">leading cause of death for women</a> in the United States. Hypertension <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/pregnancy.htm">affects one in every twelve to seventeen pregnancies</a> in the United States. Women with hypertension are at risk for developing preeclampsia, stroke, and other serious complications in pregnancy and/or postpartum. Factors which increase the risk of hypertension during pregnancy include obesity and maternal age. Factors which limit women’s ability to manage their blood pressure include cost, transportation, schedules, locality (living in rural or underserved areas), and lack of education about the importance of good blood pressure control.</p>

<p>Innovative programs can overcome these challenges to increase the number of Americans with good blood pressure control and improve the nation’s health. Some progress has been made with home blood pressure monitoring, text-based communications with health care teams, revised prenatal and postpartum visit schedules, new models of patient education and empowerment, and partnerships with different members of the health care team and community.</p>

<h4 id="purpose">Purpose</h4>

<p>OWH is creating a national competition to identify effective, pre-existing programs that care for people with hypertension where the programs could be or are already applied to women with hypertension who are pregnant and/or postpartum. The goal of this innovative competition is to demonstrate sustainability and the ability to replicate and/or expand a program that provides effective monitoring and follow-up of hypertension for women who are pregnant and/or postpartum.</p>

<h4 id="subject-and-scope-of-prize-competition">Subject and Scope of Prize Competition</h4>

<p>This program will include attention to disparities, including racial/ethnic and/or urban/rural. The program must demonstrate evidence-based approaches to screening and treating hypertensive disorders and will be shared with the general public.</p>

<p>The competition has three phases. All eligible submissions will be evaluated, and separate prizes may be awarded for each of the three phases.</p>
