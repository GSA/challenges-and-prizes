I"e<p>Are you ready to get hands-on with a NASA project next year? In August, NASA’s TechRise Student Challenge will start accepting entries. Teachers are welcome to pre-register now and we will email you with more TechRise content, including curricula, summer workshops, and events as they become available.</p>

<p>From remote sensing and climate research, to microgravity experiments and technologies to explore the Moon, schools are invited to join NASA in its mission to advance space exploration and enhance our knowledge of Earth. If you are in 6th to 12th grade at a U.S. public, private, or charter school next school year, your challenge is to team up with your schoolmates and design a research or technology experiment no larger than 4in x 4in x 8in for one of the following flight test vehicles:</p>

<p>Suborbital rocket with at least 3 minutes of microgravity (i.e., zero-gravity or weightlessness).</p>

<p>High-altitude balloon with more than 4 hours of flight time at 70,000 feet or higher with exposure to Earth’s atmosphere and views of the planet.</p>

<p>To enter this Fall, students will develop experiment ideas in teams and generate answers to application questions using the TechRise Proposal Template. An educator or adult employee of the school will then submit the proposal to this competition website. Each proposal must specify whether the experiment is intended for a suborbital rocket or for a high-altitude balloon flight and should be developed using the Challenge Design Guidelines. Teachers/schools can submit an unlimited number of proposals, but each proposal should be unique.</p>

<p>57 winners will each be awarded a prize pack which consists of: $1500 to develop the proposed experiment, an assigned a spot on a NASA-sponsored flight operated by one of the following flight providers – Blue Origin, UP Aerospace, or Raven Aerostar, and a winner’s package inclusive of a 3D-printed Flight Box to use to build the experiment.</p>
