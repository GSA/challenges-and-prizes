I"A<p>Challenge objectives include designing, building and delivering flight-qualified, small satellites capable of advanced operations near and beyond the moon.  The challenge and prize purse are divided into three major areas:
– Ground Tournaments: $500,000 in the four qualifying ground tournaments to determine who will have the ability to fly on the first SLS flight;
– Lunar Derby: $1.5 million purse for demonstrating communication and CubeSat durability at a distance greater than almost 2.5 million miles (4,000,000 km), 10 times the distance from the Earth to the moon; and
– Deep Space Derby: $3 million purse for demonstrating the ability to place a CubeSat in a stable lunar orbit and demonstrate communication and durability near the moon.</p>

<p>The Cube Quest Challenge seeks to develop and test subsystems necessary to perform deep space exploration using small spacecraft.  Advancements in small spacecraft capabilities will provide benefits to future missions and also may enable new mission scenarios, including future investigations of near-Earth asteroids.</p>
