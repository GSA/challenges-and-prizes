I"£<p>With a constantly evolving career landscape, students often need support in planning for careers and college. While the current career guidance and counseling infrastructure plays a critical role in assisting students, one in five high schools nationwide lacks a school counselor. In 2013, the national average student-to-school-counselor ratio for K-12 counselors was 482:1. As a result, students receive only minutes of in-person time with their counselor annually, as they prepare to make postsecondary education and career decisions.    This Challenge seeks apps that will help students learn about all career options, while increasing the capacity of career counselors to assist students in planning for their futures. The apps should include integrated tools to assess student skills and interests, and offer information on occupations, education options, credentials, and career-seeking skills.    Those interested in participating in the Challenge should submit their mobile app solutions by December 6, 2015. Up to five entrants will be selected to advance as finalists. Finalists will be awarded $25,000 each and will have the opportunity to improve upon their submissions during the Virtual Accelerator Phase, which will include access to mentorship from IBM and Microsoft.Â  The Challenge winner(s) will win the remainder of the prize money and additional prizes, including IBM Global Entrepreneurship Program Credits, Microsoft BizSpark Plus, and free hosting services. <br />   <strong>For a complete list of Challenge rules, access to APIs, and to submit a concept, visit <a href="http://www.reachhigherchallenge.com" target="_blank">www.reachhigherchallenge.com</a>.</strong></p>
