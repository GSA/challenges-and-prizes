<h4 id="prize-breakdown">Prize Breakdown</h4>

<p>Up to ten (10) winners will be selected, with each winning up to $50,000.</p>

<p>Although gender inequality in science, medicine, and engineering faculty occurs across the United States, patterns of challenges emerge between institutions. Recognizing that disparities exist amongst institutions, judges will evaluate entries in two pools to allow for fair competition. Five of the ten prizes will be awarded to low or limited-resource institutions.  Submissions from low or limited-resource institutions will be judged against one another to select those five winners.</p>

<h4 id="non-monetary-prizes">Non-monetary Prizes</h4>

<p>Additional submissions may be recognized as honorable mentions with non-monetary awards. Winning participants and honorable mentions may be invited to present their approaches at an NIH Office on Research for Womenâ€™s Health hosted scientific symposium. NIH will not provide travel funds for the event.</p>

<h4 id="award-approving-official">Award Approving Official</h4>

<p>The Award Approving Official will be Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
