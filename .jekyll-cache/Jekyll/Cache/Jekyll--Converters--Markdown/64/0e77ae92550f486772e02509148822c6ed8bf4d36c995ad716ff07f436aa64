Any electronic information technology that is ultimately obtained by HHS for its use, development, or maintenance must meet Section 508 accessibility and usability standards. Past experience has demonstrated that it can be costly for solution-providers to ‚Äúretrofit‚Äù solutions if remediation is later needed. The HHS Section 508 Evaluation Product Assessment Template, available at <em>hhs.gov/od/vendors/index.html</em><em>,</em> provides a useful roadmap for developers to review. It is a simple, Web-based checklist utilized by HHS officials to allow vendors to document how their products do or do not meet the various Section 508 requirements.

(x) By entering a Submission, Contestant represents, warrants and agrees that the Submission (including, without limitation, the Application) is the original work of the Contestant and complies with the Official Rules.    Contestant further represents, warrants and agrees that any use of the Submission by the Sponsor, Administrator and/or Judges (or any of their respective partners, subsidiaries and affiliates) as authorized by these Official Rules, shall not:    a. infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate any intellectual property right or proprietary right including, without limitation, any statutory or common law trademark, copyright or patent, nor any privacy rights, moral rights nor any other rights of any person or entity; or    b. constitute or result in any misappropriation or other violation of any person‚Äôs publicity rights or right of privacy.    ¬†  &lt;h5 id="6-submission-rights"&gt;<strong>6.

This license includes posting or linking to the Public Submission on Sponsor and Administrator‚Äôs websites, including the Competition Website, and partner websites, and inclusion of the Submission in any other media, worldwide. The Non-Public Submission may be viewed by the Sponsor, Administrator, and Judges for screening and evaluation purposes.

DISPLAY OF SUBMISSIONS</strong>&lt;/h5&gt;  A. Eligible Submissions will be posted on the Competition Website on a rolling basis after being screened and/or tested by the Administrator for basic functionality, accuracy of messaging, integrity (i.e., security) and appropriateness of content. The Administrator has the right to request additional information and be provided access to the Application in person or via any reasonable manner to verify the Application functions and operates as stated in the Submission. Failure by a Contestant to respond or honor such a request may result in disqualification of the Submission.    B. Posting of a Submission to the Competition Website does not constitute a final determination by the Sponsor and/or Administrator that the Submission met requirements. Accordingly, a Submission may still be disqualified even after it has been publically displayed.  &lt;h5 id="8-winner-selection-and-judging-criteria"&gt;<strong>8. WINNER SELECTION AND JUDGING CRITERIA</strong>&lt;/h5&gt;  A. All eligible Submissions will be judged by an expert panel of impartial judges (the ‚ÄúJudges‚Äù) selected by the Sponsor. The internal panel will judge these Submissions on the criteria identified in these Official Rules to select finalist Submissions. Finalist Submissions will then be judged by the expert judging panel determined by the Sponsor. The judging panel is not required to test the Application and may choose to judge based solely on the text description and video provided in the Submission.¬† The Sponsor and the Administrator reserve the right to divide and assign the criteria identified below in these Official Rules among different members of the internal and expert judging panels. The Sponsor and the Administrator reserve the right to substitute or modify the judging panel at any time for any reason.    B. All Judges shall be and remain fair and impartial. Any Judge may recuse him or herself from judging a Submission if the Judge, the Sponsor or the Administrator considers that it is inappropriate, for any reason, for the Judge to evaluate a specific Submission or group of Submissions.    C. A Contestant‚Äôs likelihood of winning will depend primarily on the number and quality of all of the Submissions, as determined by the Judges using the criteria in these Official Rules. The judging period is May 30, 2016 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time through July 1, 2016 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time (the ‚ÄúJudging Period‚Äù).    D. Criteria:    <strong>Judging Criteria:</strong>    a. Quality of Idea (Includes the degree to which the proposed app can support patient recovery by addressing the required and optional insights, the creativity of the idea and the innovation of the proposed app to support recovery).    b. Implementation of Idea (Includes how well the idea was implemented including the user experience, design and technical functionality).    c. Potential Impact (includes the patient value and potential impact the application can have for individuals in recovery).    E. If deemed necessary by the judging panel, each of the top five finalists may be asked to participate in a virtual or in-person meeting with federal staff to discuss their Application and demonstrate its operation. The purpose of these meetings will be to further evaluate the Contestant‚Äôs product, provide any additional information to SAMHSA, and clarify any concerns or questions raised by the review panel.    F. Tie Breakers. In the event of a tie between two or more Submissions, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied submissions.    G. The Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to    a. cancel, suspend, or modify the Challenge, and/or    b. not award any prizes if no submissions are deemed worthy.    H. All decisions made by the Sponsor regarding adherence to contest rules are final.    I. All selection of contest winners is final.    &lt;h5&gt;<strong>9. VERIFICATION OF POTENTIAL WINNERS</strong>&lt;/h5&gt;    A.

Potential winners must continue to comply with all terms and conditions of these Official Rules throughout the Submission Period and Judging Period. Potential winners will be notified using the email address associated with the Devpost account used to enter the Submission on or about July 10 2015. For sake of clarity, if a potential winner is a team or Organization, the notification will only be sent to the Representative. In order to receive a Prize, the potential winner will be required to sign and return to the Administrator, affidavit(s) of eligibility or a similar verification document and liability/publicity release(s) within seven (7) business days (if a potential winner is a team or Organization, the Representative and all participating members must sign and return to the Administrator said affidavit(s) of eligibility or a similar verification document and liability/publicity release(s) within ten (10) business days).    B. At the sole discretion of the Sponsor and Administrator, a potential winner will be deemed ineligible to win if:    (i) the potential winner (or in the case of a team or Organization, their Representative) cannot be contacted within seven (7) business days, or is contacted and refuses the Prize;    (ii) the potential winner (or in the case of a team or Organization, their Representative or any participating member) fail(s) to sign and return the affidavit(s) of eligibility or a similar verification document and liability/publicity release(s) within seven (7) business days from receipt of such documents;    (iii) the Prize or Prize notification is returned as undeliverable; or    (iv) the Submission or the potential winner, or any member of a potential winner‚Äôs team or organization, is disqualified for any other reason.¬† In the event of such disqualification, Sponsor and Administrator at their sole discretion may award the applicable Prize to an alternate potential winner. The disqualification of one (or more) team members (or, in the case of Organizations, any participating members) from further consideration in this Competition for any reason may result in the disqualification of the entire team or Organization and of each participating member at the sole discretion of the Sponsor and/or Administrator.  &lt;h5 id="10-prizes"&gt;<strong>10.

Should any provision of these Official Rules be or become illegal or unenforceable in the jurisdiction of a permitted entrant, such illegality or unenforceability shall leave the remainder of these Official Rules unaffected and valid. The illegal or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid and enforceable provision that comes closest and best reflects the Sponsor‚Äôs intention in a legal and enforceable manner with respect to the invalid or unenforceable provision.    ¬†  &lt;h5 id="14-limitations-of-liability"&gt;<strong>14.
