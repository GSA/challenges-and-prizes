I"R<p>The Challenge seeks to develop novel synthesis technologies that use carbon dioxide (CO2) as the sole carbon source to generate molecules that can be used to manufacture a variety of products, including substrates for use in microbial bioreactors. Because CO2 is readily abundant within the Martian atmosphere, such technologies will translate into in-situ manufacturing of products to enable humans to live and thrive on the planet, and also be implemented on Earth by using both waste and atmospheric CO2 as a resource.</p>
<p>Competitors are required to build, demonstrate and produce a product from a system that manufactures simple sugars for microbial bioreactors from CO2 and hydrogen molecules, with the ultimate goal of producing glucose.</p>
<p>NASA is sponsoring the second phase of the CO2 Conversion Challenge with a total prize purse of up to $750,000. Phase 1, the Concept Phase, awarded a prize purse of $250,000 to five (5) teams. Phase 2, the Demonstration Phase, has a total prize purse of up to $750,000. The official rules for Phase 2 will be released prior to the opening of Phase 2.</p>
