<p>The Kidney Innovation Accelerator (KidneyX) is a partnership between the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the American Society of Nephrology (ASN). HHS and ASN plan to hold a series of KidneyX prize competitions to develop innovative solutions that can prevent, diagnose, and/or treat kidney diseases. Every KidneyX prize competition will define a problem, without a pre-conceived notion of what the solution(s) should be, and ask participants to find solutions. Think better, think bold, think big.</p>
<p>The initial KidneyX prize competition is "KidneyX: Redesign Dialysis," which has two phases. Phase 1 (submissions open now) asks participants to design potential solutions or components of solutions, while Phase 2 asks for the demonstration of a prototype solution or component. Both phases will be open to all eligible participants.&nbsp;<strong>Participants do not have to submit a Phase 1 entry in order to submit a Phase 2 entry.</strong></p>
<p>The Redesign Dialysis prize seeks solutions or components of solutions that offer patients significant alternatives to dialysis as it is generally practiced today. The competition is intended to attract a wide range of ideas and participants and thus to catalyze development of new, improved classes of renal replacement therapeutic options. Of particular interest is applying advanced technologies currently used in non-kidney areas to current or potential renal replacement therapy technologies. We seek ideas and participants from outside the field of kidney health as well as from within it. Many potential prize competition participants may have applicable technologies, concepts, or expertise from domains that have not previously been considered in improving renal replacement therapy. Similarly, there may be innovators working on component technologies or discrete concepts that may have utility as one part of a novel renal replacement therapy solution.</p>
<p>We're looking for solutions that can replicate normal kidney functions and improve quality of life. Solutions must address at least one of the following areas (additional details about current technical and scientific needs can be found in <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/idealab/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/KidneyX-Redesign-Dialysis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Section F of the prize announcement</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.asn-online.org/membership/BlastEmails/files/NEW_KHIRRTRoadmap_081418_DraftforPublicComment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kidney Health Initiative&rsquo;s &ldquo;Technology Roadmap for Innovative Approaches to Renal Replacement Therapy</a>.&rdquo;):</p>
