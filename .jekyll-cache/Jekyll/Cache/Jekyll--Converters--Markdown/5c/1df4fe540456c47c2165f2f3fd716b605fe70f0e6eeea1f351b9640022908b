I"ó<p>Automate key and routine Air University Library (AUL) services and operations using Augmented Reality (AR) combined with AUL&rsquo;s Integrated Library System (ILS). This is intended to facilitate routine customer requests and access at their immediate point of need, and redirect work priorities for AUL staff. Interoperability of AR with the ILS provides an option for users to become more self-reliant and self-directed using personal smartphones and other technology platforms as an alternative to relying on Library equipment, facilities, and staff.</p>
<p>Solutions should be very accessible to enhance and advance the patron&rsquo;s experience. Moreover, they should contain both simple and complex way-pointing. For example, search results could display in device, steering users to a specific item or area and aiding in navigation by triggering images, virtual maps, and/or geo-location, activating 3-D digital object overlays; also displaying items related to the materials or subjects users are seeking.&nbsp; Finally, the solution should support refined identification displaying detailed information for staff uses such as shelf-reading, allowing for better circulation inventory control, identifying gaps, and miss-shelved items.</p>
<p>The growing sophistication of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies offers tremendous opportunities to more effectively handle the digital explosion of data and information that confronts us all today.</p>
<p><strong>Posting a Solution</strong></p>
<p>Solutions can be submitted between the start and end dates published below.&nbsp; Late solutions will not be allowed, and only solutions submitted on the Challenge submission site will be accepted for consideration.&nbsp; The submission platform requires a written summary of your concept, which will be visible or &ldquo;open&rdquo; to any registered user of the submission platform.&nbsp; There is a provision to upload your White Paper to a location that is only visible to the USAF customer and MGMWERX.&nbsp; No information that is declared to be proprietary information will be made public, unless posted in a public field on the submission form.</p>

<p><strong>USAF Review, Selection, and Invitation</strong></p>
<p>During this phase, a team of USAF customers will review solution proposals.&nbsp; The top solution(s) meeting the specified requirements will be invited to participate in a design sprint phase beginning in late August 2019.</p>
<div>Selection Phase Start:&nbsp; 8/08/2019</div>
<div>Selection Phase End:&nbsp; 8/14/2019</div>
<p><strong>Design Sprint</strong></p>
<p>During this phase, invited solution providers will participate in a design workshop to refine the product specifications.&nbsp; Competitors will have the opportunity to refine their design, based on revised specifications, and at the end of this phase, will pitch their updated design.&nbsp; The deliverable at this stage is a shell of the software product to demonstrate the look and feel of the anticipated product, along with a detailed White Paper to thoroughly describe the planned features of the design.&nbsp; At the end of this Design Sprint phase, the USAF customer team will review the updated designs and select a single provider to develop the prototype.</p>
