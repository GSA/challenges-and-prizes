I"«<p><strong>Challenge Summary</strong></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Improving Care for People with Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and Related Dementias Using Technology (iCare-AD/ADRD)&rdquo; Challenge is a Eureka prize competition in which the National Institute on Aging (NIA), part of the National Institutes of Health, rewards and spurs the development of solutions for a technology-based application, fostering connections between relevant stakeholders to use technology, or the development of new technology applications to improve dementia care coordination and/or care navigation. Though the solution should foster connections between relevant stakeholders to use technology or develop new technology applications, it may be targeted at consumers (persons with dementia (PWD), caregivers), healthcare providers, healthcare service organizations, and/or health systems, and/or community, local, or state governments. Specific methods for stimulating uptake and use of the product must be included with the working proof-of-concept demonstration. Please see the &ldquo;Submission Requirements and Template&rdquo; section for the necessary submission information.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge Description</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) announces the &ldquo;Improving Care for People with Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and Related Dementias Using Technology (iCare-AD/ADRD)&rdquo; Challenge. The goal of this challenge is to improve the quality of care for persons living with Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) by establishing proof-of-concept for the creation of a widely accessible and innovative technology tool(s) that addresses unmet needs in care coordination and/or care navigation through the health system. For the purpose of this challenge, &ldquo;related dementias&rdquo; will include frontotemporal dementia, Lewy Body dementia and vascular cognitive impairment/dementia.</p>
<p>This challenge is intended to stimulate innovation in use of technology to improve care coordination and/or navigation and/or aid with the care experience, so that overall dementia care quality is improved. This challenge invites solutions that involve the development of an IT system-level, computer, mobile, and/or other form of technology-based application.&nbsp; The solutions may involve creation of a new technology application, and/or modification or novel implementation of an existing technology. &nbsp;The solutions may be targeted at consumers (persons with dementia or caregivers), healthcare providers, healthcare service organizations, and/or health systems, and/or community, local, or state government. Specific methods for stimulating uptake and use of the solutions must be included with the proof-of-concept demonstrations.</p>
<p>A working demonstration of the product is required. Specific target markets or characteristics of end users must be identified.</p>
<p>The Challenge is expected to foster connections between relevant stakeholders to use technology to improve dementia care coordination and/or care navigation. &nbsp;Collaboration with and connections between relevant healthcare stakeholders are encouraged. Collaboration across organizations, for example, physician practices, nursing homes, assisted-living facilities and smart technology vendors, is also encouraged. Examples of possible solvers include small businesses, individuals -- including but not limited to people living with dementia and caregivers -- midsize to large technology companies, health insurance companies, electronic health record (EHR) vendors, students working collaboratively across multiple disciplines, health systems, states, and/or counties implementing care coordination programs.</p>
<p>Examples that would fulfill the purpose of the Challenge include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol> <li><em>Aiding effective communication between clinicians and patients and families </em>:&nbsp; Solvers could develop a mobile application to assist persons with dementia (PWD) and caregivers at primary care and specialty physician visits. The application could be tailored to individual care needs, prepopulated with diagnoses and medications used, and include prompts for questions to ask clinicians or links to local resources and/or relevant insurance coverage information.</li> <li><em>Aiding care access and access to relevant community resources and/or enhancing user-friendliness of existing service access interfaces</em>:&nbsp; Solvers could use technology to assist PWD with aging in place, improve access to appropriate transportation options using smart devices, and coordinate health care visits.</li> <li><em>Improving care coordination</em>:&nbsp; A collaboration between a technology company, EHR vendor, and nursing home chain could yield EHR-based methods to improve care coordination. Care coordination solutions may also involve behavioral &ldquo;nudges&rdquo; for care providers and/or care recipients using smart technology and may be designed for direct use by PWD and caregivers.</li> </ol>
