<p>Vaccinations and well-child visits help prevent outbreaks of childhood diseases. Recent <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e2.htm">CDC data</a> show that fewer children got vaccines on time this year compared to last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The P4 Challenge invites applicants to propose and implement <strong>innovative approaches to increase access to and utilization of well-child visits and/or immunizations services within primary care settings.</strong></p>

<p>Innovative approaches in Phase 1 should aim to increase a key pediatric health performance measure such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Number of well-child visits (number of visits/number of children in the target population)</li>
  <li>Well-child visit disparities (comparing measures across two or more subpopulations)</li>
  <li>Doses administered of specific vaccines; coverage of the primary pediatric vaccination series (for example, number of MMR vaccines given/number of children 12-18 months in the target population)</li>
  <li>Disparities within the community on a specific immunization metric (comparing measure across two or more subpopulations)</li>
</ul>

<p>In Phase 1 of the P4 Challenge, up to 50 applicants will receive $10,000 to deploy the proposed approach in Phase 2.</p>

<p><strong>Goal of the P4 Challenge:</strong></p>

<p>The CDC reports that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6920e1.htm?s_cid=mm6920e1_x">declines in vaccination coverage</a> might leave young children and communities vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles. Well-child visits also <a href="https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/clinical-guidance/guidance-on-providing-pediatric-well-care-during-covid-19/">declined</a> since the COVID-19 pandemic. These visits are an important venue for counseling, as well as vaccine administration and documentation.</p>

<p>At well-child visits, providers can also screen for developmental delays and parents can raise concerns about a child’s physical problems, behavior and mental health and receive personalized guidance on healthy nutrition, exercise and safety.</p>

<p>It’s important to get the message out to parents and caregivers that children should maintain well-child visits and get timely vaccinations in their medical home. Children who are not up-to-date with vaccinations recommended by the CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recommendations.html">Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)</a> should be seen in primary care as soon as possible for catch-up vaccination.</p>

<p><strong>Who is encouraged to apply?</strong></p>

<p>The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) envisions partnerships from various individuals, companies and organizations to meet all of the needs of the challenge. <strong>Please note that submissions must include a primary care provider who delivers health services to children as a key submitter or partner.</strong> MCHB is seeking concept papers from a wide array of contestants and encourages anyone with a good idea and a collaborative team to apply.</p>
