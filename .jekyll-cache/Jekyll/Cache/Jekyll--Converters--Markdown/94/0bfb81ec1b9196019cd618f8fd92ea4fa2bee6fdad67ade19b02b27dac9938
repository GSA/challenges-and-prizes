I"Ë<p>The National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute‚Äôs (NCI) Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) announces that they are partnering with Sage Bionetworks to launch ‚ÄúUp For A Challenge (U4C) ‚Äì Stimulating Innovation in Breast Cancer Genetic Epidemiology‚Äù (the ‚ÄúChallenge‚Äù) to encourage unique approaches to more fully decipher the genomic basis of breast cancer.¬† Utilizing innovative approaches, the goal of this Challenge is to identify new genes or combinations of genes, genetic variants, or sets of genomic features involved in breast cancer susceptibility. In addition, the NCI aims to advance innovation in the field of genetic epidemiology by making data more widely available, increasing the amount and diversity of minds approaching a difficult scientific problem, and promoting broader collaborations.</p>

To that end, several data sets have been gathered and will be made available for use in the Challenge; some of these will be released for the first time. In addition, Challenge participants will be free to use any other publicly available data sets (subject to compliance with applicable terms and conditions) for the purposes of developing and applying methods for identification of the novel pathways.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer, and the second most common cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States.¬† An estimated 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed among women (2,350 in men) in the U.S. during 2015 with an estimated 40,730 deaths. Despite advances in breast cancer therapies, breast cancer remains a major public health burden. One approach to reduce overall occurrence and mortality from breast cancer is to develop ways of identifying women who are at increased risk for breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Epidemiologic studies suggest that genetic factors play a key role in determining who is at increased risk of developing breast cancer, as well as what type of cancer they develop. ¬†To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have helped researchers identify more than 90 common genetic variations. Although GWAS have greatly increased our understanding of the genetic components of breast cancer susceptibility, the results to date explain only a small proportion of the estimated genetic contribution to the risk of breast cancer. However, shifting the focus of analysis from individual genetic variants (also known as single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) to pathways (i.e. combinations of genes, genetic variants, or sets of genomic features), could lead to the identification of novel gene sets involved in breast cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This Challenge provides an opportunity to examine the heritable contribution to racial disparities, by facilitating access to GWAS data sets from African American, Asian, European, and Latino women.¬† African American women are known to have a lower incidence of breast cancer, but survival is lower for African American than for non-Hispanic white women at every stage of diagnosis. Meanwhile, Asian women have the lowest rates of breast cancer incidence and mortality compared with non-Hispanic white, African American, and Hispanic/Latino women.¬† Findings from this Challenge may provide insights into some of these observed differences.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As more fully described below, participants are invited to use innovative approaches to identify novel pathways‚Äîincluding new genes or combinations of genes, genetic variants, or sets of genomic features‚Äîinvolved in breast cancer susceptibility. Besides developing a better understanding of cancer risk assessment, the identification of breast cancer susceptibility genes holds promise for providing therapeutic targets for drug development.&lt;/p&gt;
