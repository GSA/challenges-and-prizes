<p><strong>Reviewer Conflict of Interest</strong></p>

<p>Prior to the start of the judging, all submissions will be reviewed to ensure no reviewer will have a conflict of interest with any submission he/she will be reviewing. Reviewers in this challenge may not review a submission in which they (a) have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of any entity that is a registered participant in the Prize challenge; or (b) have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a registered participant.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>

<p>ED will screen all completed submissions to determine compliance with submission criteria and assign reviewers to independently score the content of each qualified submission. The reviewers will be composed of ED subject matter experts with expertise in relevant website and web design areas. The size of the review panel will be based on the number of entrants.  As needed, after preliminary consideration of all submissions for suitability in terms of innovation, quality of redesign and compliance with federal web standards, ED will eliminate those not meeting these standards in order to determine compliance with submission criteria. Reviewers will offer input scores on those submissions passing the initial review.  Reviewers will rate submissions using the judging criteria above and make non-consensus forming recommendations as to which finalists should be selected as winners. ED will make final selection determinations. One or more concepts will be selected as winners. Up to three prize winners may be selected from the submissions, including a Grand Prize, a Runner Up, and an Honorable Mention.</p>

<p>By participating in the Challenge, each entrant acknowledges and agrees that such recommendations of the reviewers based on the criteria may differ and agrees to be bound by, and not to challenge, the final decisions of the Department.</p>
