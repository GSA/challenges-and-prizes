<p>Both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of this Challenge will be reviewed by members of the ORNL Cybersecurity Research Group and/or U.S. Navy subject matter experts.</p>

<h4 id="judging-criteria">Judging Criteria</h4>

<p>Submissions will be judged based on how they address the SOAR capability criteria below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ability to ingest custom logging / alerts</li>
  <li>
    <p>Playbook / Workflow Use:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Usefulness of existing playbooks</li>
      <li>Ability of junior operators to effectively use workflows/playbooks</li>
      <li>Efficiency gains by using workflows/playbooks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Playbook / Workflow customization:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Easy and flexible creation of custom workflows/playbooks</li>
      <li>Shareability of workflows/playbooks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Task Automation:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Quickly resolving and documenting false positive alerts</li>
      <li>Ability to automate common tasks such as responding to phishing attacks and failed user logins</li>
      <li>Effectiveness of automation</li>
      <li>Efficiency gains from automation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Documentation Automation:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ability to prepopulate alert and logging data into tickets</li>
      <li>Ability to collect all needed data for elevating events to incidents and handing incident to higher tier / higher experience SOC personnel</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ability to rank / score alerts so that analysts can easily prioritize alerts from most to least significant</li>
  <li>
    <p>Collaboration facilitation:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Shareability of in-progress and completed investigations</li>
      <li>Real time collaboration</li>
      <li>Asynchronous collaboration (hand offs)</li>
      <li>Ability to provide metrics on how much time / money the SOAR tool is saving the organization</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Unique features: Unique features of the SOAR tool may be considered on the basis of facilitating functionality or adding value to the SOC.</li>
</ol>

<p>To select which tools will advance from Phase 1 to Phase 2, ORNL will conduct a comparative analysis of the submitted white-papers to determine how well they meet the above specified criteria. Navy SOC analysts will review the provided demonstration videos and provide feedback to ORNL on which tools they are most interested in seeing tested based on the SOAR capability criteria listed above.</p>

<p>In Phase 2, ORNL will conduct an analysis of each toolâ€™s ability to rank alerts, ingest data (both non-standard formats and widely supported formats), facilitate playbook creation and execution, automate ticket population and common tasks, and facilitate communication between potentially geographically separated SOCs. The winner(s) will be the submission whose cumulative score across all of these areas is highest.</p>
