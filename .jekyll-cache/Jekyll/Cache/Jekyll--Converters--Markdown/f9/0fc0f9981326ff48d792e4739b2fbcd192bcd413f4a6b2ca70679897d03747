I"ù<p><em><strong>NOTE: competition timeline was extended until January 17, 2018. Top-ranked teams were invited to PerfLoc Demo Days at NIST on April 26-27, 2018 where the winner was determined.</strong></em></p>
<p>This competition is about developing the best possible indoor localization and tracking app for Android smartphones.Â Indoor localization is the capability to determine/estimate the location of an entity to be localized or tracked, such as a person, a robot, or some other object equipped with an appropriate electronic device in buildings and subterranean structures such as tunnels, caves, and underground mines. Localization and tracking, whether indoors or outdoors, has a wide range of applications, including emergency response and law enforcement. Other applications include fleet management, asset tracking in factories/warehouses/hospitals, tracking the elderly/children, personal navigation in museums and shopping malls, social networking, and the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
<p>PerfLoc Prize CompetitionÂ participants are required to use the extensive Android smartphone data repository developed by NIST to develop their apps and have their appsâ€™ performance evaluated through the PerfLoc Performance Evaluation Portal.Â Â The Prize Purse for the PerfLoc Prize Competition is a total of $35,000. In addition, up to five finalists will be provided invitational travel funds to travel to the NIST campus in Gaithersburg, MD for live tests of their apps at App Demo Days February 15-16, 2018. Up to three finalists will be selected as winners at the App Demo Days at NIST. Up to three winners will be provided invitational travel funds by NIST to showcase their apps at the 2018 IEEE IPSN Conference in Porto, Portugal, April 11-1, 2018. </p>
