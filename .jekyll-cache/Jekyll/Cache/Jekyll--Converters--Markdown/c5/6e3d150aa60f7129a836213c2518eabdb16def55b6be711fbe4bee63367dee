I"/<p>The goal of the 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge is to foster the development of new technologies necessary to additively manufacture a habitat using local indigenous materials with, or without, recyclable materials.  The Structural Member Competition (Phase 2) – will focus on the core 3D-Printing fabrication technologies and materials properties needed to manufacture structural components from indigenous materials combined with recyclables, or indigenous materials alone; serves as a qualifier for participation in Phase 3.    On-Site Habitat Competition (Phase 3) – (to be announced at a later date) will focus on the 3D-Printing fabrication of a scaled habitat design, using indigenous materials combined with recyclables, or indigenous materials alone, and will have a prize purse of $1.4 million.</p>
