<p>The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with federal and state partners,&nbsp;is seeking new ideas for successful and cost-effective downstream fish passage&nbsp;at tall&nbsp;dams. &nbsp;Effective downstream passage for migrating juvenile fish will help us recover threatened and endangered species such as salmon and steelhead. A successful solution should describe how fish will be attracted to the system and how fish will be collected, conveyed, and released. &nbsp;Solutions should minimize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical damage to fish</li>
<li>Stress (e.g. crowding, removal from water, disorientation)</li>
<li>Impacts to&nbsp;the operation of the dam</li>
<li>Overall cost</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an Ideation Challenge with a guaranteed award for at least one submitted solution.</p>
