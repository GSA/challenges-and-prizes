I"n<p>You can help patients inside and outside of the VA network by competing to build a system that creates and updates synthetic patient data to provide more relevant development data. Ultimately, PseudoVet will reduce the time required to develop useful simulated patient data and improve the reliability and usefulness of test data by producing data that is realistic with respect to actual patient population snapshots.    <em>Your work could benefit thousands of patients inside and outside of the VA network.</em>    PseudoVet is an automated patient data fabrication engine used by software developers at the VA. It provides a set of active synthetic patients and clinical data that can be used for healthcare software development without exposing patient health information or personally identifiable information.    However, current fabricated data sets are outdated, which requires development teams to spend time developing data sets to use in lieu of writing code, or require licenses and cannot be shared.    <strong>In this challenge, competitors are tasked with building PseudoVet, software that will:</strong>  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Populate new synthetic patients into a database&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Continuously create new appointments, lab values, progress notes, diagnosis and procedures that are relevant to real-world scenarios&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Assign a configurable percentage of patients with service connected disabilities based on common war-era disabilities/traumas&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  <strong>Put your skills to the test! </strong>Help c<span style="color: #000000;">reate a software engine </span><span style="color: #000000;">that will help software developers at the VA better serve patients.
