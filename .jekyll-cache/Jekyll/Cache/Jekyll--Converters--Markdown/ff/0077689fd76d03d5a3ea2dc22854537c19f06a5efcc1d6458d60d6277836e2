I"Ÿ<p><span lang="EN">The majority of U.S. fossil fuel-fired electricity generating units submit quarterly reports on their hourly nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions along with select operating parameters (e.g., hourly heat input, gross electricity generation). EPA&rsquo;s Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) makes these data available through a variety of online reports and applications. Information about CAMD data can be found in the Plain English Guide to Part 75.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">CAMD is looking to academic and research institutions to propose practical and replicable projects that benefit academic institutions, the environment, and the public.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Submissions for innovative and creative uses of CAMD data should advance the knowledge, use, and understanding of CAMD data and related information, with priority on the following possible project themes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Analyzing emission data</span></strong><span lang="EN"><strong>:</strong> Answer timely and relevant research questions using CAMD data</span></li>
<li><strong>Enhancing communications</strong><span lang="EN"><strong>:</strong> Design new and innovative ways (e.g., data visualizations) to present CAMD data to the public</span></li>
<li><strong>Developing technology and data mashups</strong><span lang="EN"><strong>:</strong> Develop new technologies or analytic methods to integrate CAMD data with other datasets to unlock the broader potential of CAMD data</span></li>
<li><strong>Promoting environmental education</strong><span lang="EN"><strong>:</strong> Explore opportunities to use CAMD data in high school or university classrooms</span></li>
<li><strong>Improving data quality</strong><span lang="EN"><strong>:</strong> Identify and apply algorithms (e.g., machine learning) to electronically audit CAMD data and enhance data quality</span></li>
