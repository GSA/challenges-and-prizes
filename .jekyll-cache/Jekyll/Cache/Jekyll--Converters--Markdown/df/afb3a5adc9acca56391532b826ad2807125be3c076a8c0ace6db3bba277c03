<p>Participation by Government Support Contractors. Government support contractors will assist in the review of any data provided by participants.

In the case of an award under 10 U.S. Code, Section 2371b, a successful prototype project may result in the further award of a follow-on OTA without additional competition.

<p>NOTE:&nbsp; The Government may negotiate Government Purpose Rights when requesting proposals if an Other Transaction Authority award is contemplated.</p>

<p>Intellectual Property (IP) Rights. All data submitted under the Prize Challenge will be made available to NAVSEA and parties authorized to act on behalf of NAVSEA.&nbsp;&nbsp; By accepting these Terms and Conditions, the participant consents to the use of data submitted to NAVSEA.&nbsp; Any materials submitted to NAVSEA as part of a prize challenge submission become NAVSEA records and will not be returned.</p>
<p>The use of protective markings such as &ldquo;Do Not Publicly Release &ndash; Trade Secret&rdquo; or &ldquo;Do Not Publicly Release &ndash; Confidential Proprietary Business Information&rdquo; in the Header or Footer of the Submission is strongly encouraged where appropriate.&nbsp; However, participants should be aware that the use of protective markings is not dispositive as to whether information will be released publicly pursuant to a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act, (FOIA) 5 U.S.C. &sect;552, et. seq., as amended by the OPEN Government Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110-175. Any information received from the participant is considered to be a federal agency record, and as such, subject to public release under FOIA.&nbsp; Decisions to disclose or withhold information received from a participant are based on the applicability of one or more of the nine FOIA exemptions, not on the existence or nonexistence of protective markings.&nbsp; Only the agency&rsquo;s designated FOIA Officer may determine if information sought under a FOIA request will be withheld pursuant to one or more of the nine FOIA exemptions. All FOIA requests received by NAVSEA are processed in accordance with 10 C.F.R. Part 1004.&nbsp; Participants will be notified of any FOIA requests for their submissions in accordance with 29 C.F.R. &sect; 70.26.&nbsp; Participants may then have the opportunity to review materials and work with a NAVSEA FOIA representative prior to the release of materials.</p>
