<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>The purpose of this Challenge &mdash; &ldquo;A Wearable Alcohol Biosensor: A Second Challenge&rdquo; &mdash; is to produce a prototype of a sleek, unobtrusive wearable capable of monitoring blood alcohol, non-invasively, and in real time. Such a device would significantly advance current alcohol monitoring capabilities. Highest priority will be given to devices that use non-invasive technologies to measure alcohol concentration in the blood or interstitial fluids, as opposed to detection of alcohol exuded through the skin in sweat or vapor. We welcome creative approaches &mdash; surprise us!</p>
