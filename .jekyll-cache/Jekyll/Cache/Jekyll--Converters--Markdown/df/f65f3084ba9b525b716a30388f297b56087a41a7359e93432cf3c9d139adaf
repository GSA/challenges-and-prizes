I"ò<p><strong>The Problem</strong>  There is a growing global concern about the challenges agricultural and food production need to overcome in the next few decades. By 2050, the worldâ€™s population is expected to reach 9 billionâ€“with over a billion at risk of hungerâ€“and arable land is becoming increasingly scarce.Â  Additionally, developing countries suffer the most from a lack of food security and low household incomes.    For these reasons, one of the priorities sainder the Sustainable Development Goals is to achieve food security and improve livelihoods by raising smallholder farmersâ€™ productivity.    Digital technologies have upended business models and expanded the frontiers of information access in the developing world. Increasingly available digital technologies including sensors, geospatial imagery, mobile financial services, and data analytics can be leveraged to make agriculture more precise, productive, resilient, and profitable. However, too often that data and analysis remains in research intuitions and on computer servers rather than reaching farmers or those who work with them.    <strong>Prize Statement</strong>  The prize is seeking tools and approaches that source, analyze and translate data into actionable, timely and context-specific information for smallholder farmers to improve value from agricultural productivity.    In particular the data driven solutions will be tested in Nepal, and should be able to meet one or more of the following outcomes:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Produce timely and context specific insight for improving the production of rice, other cereals and vegetables in Nepal.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Support a more sustainable use of Nepalâ€™s natural resources (i.e. increase biodiversity, use water more sustainably, improve use of land).&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Enable the market by providing inputs, extension services, and connections which support farmers in a sustainable way in Nepal.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Improve influence and application of agricultural products in Nepal (i.e. better use of fertilizer, generation of quality seeds).&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Generate timely and actionable information to manage Nepalâ€™s agricultural productivity risks due toÂ  weather emergency.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;</p>
