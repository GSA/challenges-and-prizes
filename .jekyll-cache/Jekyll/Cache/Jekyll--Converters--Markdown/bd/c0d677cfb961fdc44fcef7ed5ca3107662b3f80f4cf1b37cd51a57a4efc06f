<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA(ALT)) is announcing its newest xTech competition, in partnership with the Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Army Research Office (ARO), the xTech Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities and Minority Serving Institutions (also referred to as xTechHBCU). xTechHBCU aims to engage with eligible institutions as defined below and highlight opportunities to collaborate with the Army to tackle critical Army challenges, earn prize money, network with Army program managers and provide potential funding opportunities to tackle Army challenges.</p>

<p>The ASA(ALT) recognizes that diverse perspectives provide a critical source of innovative talent and novel concepts for the advancement of Army Modernization Priorities and national security. In a concerted effort to attract truly novel perspectives, this initiative will target covered institutions that have historically received less funding than their counterparts, such as non-Tier 1 (R1) colleges and universities, with the intent to fund institutions that have not otherwise received a significant amount of funding from the DoD Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) programs.</p>

<p>xTechHBCU will provide a structured and focused entry path for eligible participants to submit novel concepts and technology solutions directly to the U.S. Army and provide opportunities for these participants to become integrated into the Army’s science and technology (S&amp;T) ecosystem by providing research opportunities with Army labs.  Participants will receive detailed feedback from Army and Department of Defense (DoD) stakeholders; and will have access to training, mentorship, networking opportunities and other support infrastructure as they progress through the contest to determine how best to align their research proposals with real Army problems and Users.</p>

<p>xTechHBCU will combine a prize competition with structured opportunities for follow-on research funding awards of up to $150,000. Competitions for cash prize awards will be executed under authorities 10 U.S.C. § 2374a and 10 U.S.C. § 2362. Follow-on opportunities will be left to the discretion of the participating agencies as they have the authority to award a variety of instruments. It is anticipated that up to a maximum of three (3) follow-on awards for up to $150,000 each may be awarded in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, technology investment agreements (TIAs), or other transactions for prototypes (OTAs). Participating agencies reserve the right to select the type of instrument most appropriate for the effort proposed.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of xTechHBCU is to provide an innovative approach with multiple avenues for enduring connections with the Army S&amp;T ecosystem and to highlight opportunities for participants to collaborate with the Army to tackle critical Army challenges.  Five (5) critical technology focus areas are identified at the end of this announcement, where basic and applied research solutions are needed to enable our future Army to succeed and where follow-on research funding may be available for the eligible entities described above. For each submission, at least one of the five (5) focus areas below must be addressed and noted in the drop-down menu provided on the xTechHBCU registration page.</p>

<p><strong>Problem Statements</strong></p>

<p><em>Topic 1 (Computing Sciences): Knowledge Systems</em></p>

<p>The overall objective of the Knowledge Systems program is to augment human decision makers (both commanders and Soldiers) with enhanced-embedded battlefield intelligence that will provide them with the necessary situational awareness, reconnaissance, and decision making tools to decisively defeat any future adversarial threats which is in line with the DoD’s adoption of net-centric warfare, variously defined as flattening the information space to interconnect Soldiers and commanders to provide instantaneous access to information, knowledge, and situational awareness. Given this goal, it becomes necessary to understand (a) fundamentals of what intelligence means in the context of autonomous systems and how to build intelligent systems especially as it relates to interaction amongst a network of humans and machines, and (b) foundational algorithmic issues in representation and reasoning about networks inherent in societies and nature.</p>

<p><strong>Information Networks.</strong> In order to model network effects, it is necessary to algorithmically represent large networks and reason about them. Unfortunately, information about networks is seldom complete – data available might be missing crucial pieces of information, might have contradictory pieces of information, or could be approximate (with associated notions of uncertainty). Representing and reasoning about these networks requires advances in knowledge representation, graph and data mining, natural language processing, algorithmic graph theory, machine learning, and uncertainty quantification and reasoning. Examples include the emerging area of Graphons which provide new tools for generating and reasoning about graphs that occur in practice (satisfying power law distributions), but also provide new tools for Machine Learning. In particular, a major goal of this thrust are tools and techniques that allow data driven approaches to capturing latent relationships with powers to both explain and predict. Advances in this thrust would not only lead to improved autonomous systems and algorithms, but also enhanced-embedded battlefield intelligence with tools for creating necessary situational awareness, reconnaissance, and decision making. Finally, it should be noted that algorithmic notions of approximations, tight performance bounds, probabilistic guarantees, etc., would be major concerns of the solution space.</p>

<p><strong>Adversarial Reasoning.</strong> Development of appropriate mathematical tools to model and reason about societies and cultures, that brings together tools from Game Theory, Social Sciences and Knowledge Representation. Research of interest includes, but is not limited to, Game Theory for security applications while accounting for bounded rationality, development of Game Theory based on data regarding cultural and adversarial groups, and Behavioral Game Theory that can explain intelligence in groups and societies. In particular, the role of human biases in decision making and game theory is of importance to this thrust of the program.</p>

<p><strong>Natural Language Processing and Affective Computing.</strong> Inference algorithms work incredibly well when data is in a structured format. However, most reports, email, and conversations are written out as text with information embedded in them. This thrust seeks advances in purposeful Natural Language Processing at scale that can account for context and mode-switches by bringing together statistical and logical methods. Indeed, when combined with other signals, such as video signals, the inter-play of non-verbal and verbal/ textual communication provides rich contextual information, which, in turn, leads to accurate information being gleaned from an interaction.</p>

<p><em>Topic 2 (Computing Sciences): Advanced Learning Intelligent Cyber Physical Systems</em></p>

<p>Advanced Learning Intelligent Cyber Physical Systems, including both embodied systems and software agents, play an increasingly important role in civilian and military settings. With few exceptions, current intelligent systems are restricted to highly constrained environments for short duration missions. Future systems will need to perform a variety of tasks in complex, possibly contested, open worlds for extended periods of time. One important characteristic of open worlds is that the intelligent system will encounter new contexts, activities, and objects that will require it to adapt previously trained algorithms. Advanced capabilities in learning, knowledge representation and reasoning, interaction, and assured operations are essential to the development of intelligent systems that can greatly enhance the Army’s mobility, agility, lethality, and survivability in future conflicts.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Theory, Methodology, and Techniques.</strong> Over the past 50 years, machine learning has made great strides in classification, natural language processing, and task learning. However, machine learning still lacks the rigor, agility, and flexibility necessary to operate in complex, contested open worlds. This thrust focuses on establishing a theoretical foundation for on-line or continuous machine learning. New learning approaches will need to address both the dimensionality challenges and temporal characteristics that may be evolving continuously. In addition, new techniques must address robustness to enable the learning system to deal with novelty, noise, observation errors, and potentially malicious input that aims to disrupt learning. Innovative approaches to continuous learning will allow systems to adapt to changing contexts and environments while maintaining previously learned knowledge. Under this thrust, we investigate approaches that help the intelligent systems deal with dynamic environments, devise new, transferable skills, and cope with unknown situations. Skill acquisition focuses on developing new theories for learning, creating, and combining low-level skills into more sophisticated behaviors.</p>

<p><strong>Knowledge Representation, Reasoning and Decision Making.</strong> Long duration autonomy requires intelligent systems to manage information from different sources, including humans, knowledge bases, and external and on-board sensors. Data collected at different times and locations needs to be fused into a consistent understanding of objects and events in the environment, to support decision making and efficient communication with humans or other entities. Long duration autonomy requires reflecting on past experiences, combining, comparing, and using those experiences in new contexts to make decisions. Innovative research in representation and reasoning will enable future intelligent systems to manage information in both short and long-term memory systems, and develop new information through reflection and learning. Concepts from cognitive science may impact both the representation and storage of information and the ability to quickly retrieve pertinent information. New approaches are needed to combine reasoning with deep learning enabling systems to discover and use relationships between objects and concepts in learning, inference and reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><strong>Interaction.</strong> Future autonomous systems must interact physically with humans and other intelligent systems operating in the same space, remotely with spatially distant entities, and virtually in cyberspace with intelligent software agents. New research in human-robot interaction and robot-robot teaming will enable humans and robots to share the same space and work together on complex tasks. Advanced concepts for networks of intelligent agents will enable robots at the tactical edge to draw upon off-board resources such as, software agents, humans, or other robots to solve local problems as well as contribute to a shared knowledge base, and coordinate and collaborate with others for larger problems in dynamic environments. New research in game theory, deception, and other approaches will enable intelligent systems to operate effectively in a contested environment. Future battlefields pose a number of challenges in communications including, limited bandwidth and the availability of secure communication channels. New concepts are needed to build and maintain shared, but possibly distributed, information models for these environments.</p>

<p><strong>Assured Operations.</strong> Test, Evaluation, and Verification and Validation for intelligent systems is a nascent field that needs rigorous theoretical underpinnings and practical tools. Long duration missions require intelligent systems that can operate safely and reliably in an open world environment. Extending techniques from computer science and control theory, such as control barrier functions and model checking, can help ensure safe operations during both learning and execution of mission-related activities, but these techniques by themselves are not sufficient for assured operations. Theoretical advances in architectures, control theory, and introspection are needed to enable systems to adapt to temporary or permanent changes to internal and external conditions in a timely manner. Advances in risk-aware online planning will enable autonomous systems to balance conflicting objectives and operate safely in poorly understood environments.</p>

<p><em>Topic 3 (Life Sciences): Neurophysiology of Cognition</em></p>

<p>The Neurophysiology of Cognition program supports non-medically oriented basic research in neuroscience, the behavioral sciences, physiology and neuroengineering that might enable the optimization of Soldier’s cognitive and physical performance capabilities. An overarching goal of the program is to provide foundational knowledge of molecular, cellular and systems-level neural codes underlying cognition and performance across multiple length and time scales. Research in this program can include a broad range of methodological and theoretical approaches applied to animal and human experimental systems including electrophysiology, neuroimaging and computational neurobiology. This includes the study of the psycho-physiological implications of brain-machine interfaces, the measurement and modeling of individual cognitive dynamics and decision making during real-world activity, and identifying how neuronal circuits generate desirable computations. In the long term, research in this area may enable the development of interfaces enabling humans to more efficiently control machines, new training methods and devices to predict and optimize individual performance, and the potential restoration from injury at the neural level. Basic research opportunities are sought in two primary research thrusts within this program: (i) Multisensory Synthesis and (ii) Neuronal Computation.</p>

<p><strong>Multisensory Synthesis.</strong> The Multisensory Synthesis thrust aims to understand how the human brain functions in relation to the interaction of sensory, cognitive and motor processes during its performance of real-world tasks. Research focuses on mapping, quantifying and modeling distributed neural processes, physiological processes and mind-body interfaces that mediate these features to ultimately develop better understanding of cognition for eventual application to Soldier performance.</p>

<p><strong>Neuronal Computation.</strong> The Neuronal Computation thrust is focused on understanding how living neuronal circuits generate desirable computations, affect how information is represented, show robustness to damage, incorporate learning and facilitate evolutionary change. Research focuses on determining how brains structure, process and refine inputs into efficient decisions and behaviors, and how these multiscale features are altered under stresses. Cell culture, brain slice and in vivo models are used to develop better understanding of small and large-scale living neural networks for eventual application in Army systems.</p>

<p><em>Topic 4 (Life Sciences): Human Dimension</em></p>

<p>The Human Dimension Program supports multidisciplinary basic research in areas that include neural and cognitive sciences, behavioral and social sciences and human factors and neural engineering with an emphasis on modeling, predicting and enhancing human perceptual, cognitive, affective, physical, and social performance in individuals, groups and societies. An overarching goal of the program is to provide foundational knowledge of neural, biophysiological and cognitive-based mechanisms underlying individual, group and societal cognition and performance across multiple time scales. In the long term, research in this area may enable new training tools to predict and optimize cognitive/physical performance and team intelligence, interfaces enabling humans to more efficiently control machines and psychophysiologically-based predictive models of complex individual – societal dynamics. Basic research opportunities are sought in two primary research thrusts within this program: (i) Cognitive-Physical Interactions and (ii) Cognitive-Social Interactions.</p>

<p><strong>Cognitive-Physical Interactions.</strong> The Cognitive-Physical Interactions thrust seeks to support high-risk seed projects that use multimodal approaches to uncover dynamic and multiscale interactions of neural-cognitive and physiological systems. The goal of this thrust area is to advance the experimental and analytical tools available to develop comprehensive understanding of the impact of group and individual state-trait variability on human performance, human-systems interfaces and team intelligence. Research topics are supported in diverse areas that can include the neurobiological mechanisms of expert skill learning, closed-loop brain-computer interfaces and novel mind-body interfaces such as the microbiome-gut-brain axis.</p>

<p><strong>Cognitive-Social Interactions.</strong> The Cognitive-Social Interactions thrust seeks to develop new theories to understand the dynamic interrelationships between individual/group cognition, decision-making and the role that these influences play on interactions with large and small social systems. Multidisciplinary seed projects are supported that seek to advance the necessary analytical and experimental tools required to describe the underlying mechanistic interactions as they co-evolve in time and space. Research topics are supported in diverse areas that may include modeling the impact of mindfulness on state transitions of human cognitive, physical and social systems and describing the longitudinal neural, cognitive and social mechanisms mediating development of leadership, expertise and intelligent teams.</p>

<p><em>Topic 5 (Physics): Interface science of emerging electronic materials</em></p>

<p>A host of advanced electronic materials have emerged in the last twenty years and promise many novel technological advances in electronics. These advances, however, are often hamstrung by insufficient knowledge about interface science ranging from suitable contacting, gating, dielectrics and charge trapping to heterogeneous integration with established semiconductors. This topic seeks to address this knowledge gap specific to two emergent electronic materials families: topological materials and two-dimensional van de Waals materials. What are the fabrication, integration and processing methodologies necessary for effectual gating and contacting of these materials and for integrating them with semiconductors? Furthermore, how are the electronic properties of the material changed when integrated into a heterostructure? The Army is seeking to establish a theoretical and/or experimental research endeavor to begin to address these challenges.</p>
