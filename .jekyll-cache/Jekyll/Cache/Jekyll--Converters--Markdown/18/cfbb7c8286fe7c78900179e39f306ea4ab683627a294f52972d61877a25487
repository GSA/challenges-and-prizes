<p>The 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge seeks to develop the fundamental technologies necessary to manufacture an off-world habitat using local indigenous materials with the optional to add mission recycled materials. The long-term vision is that habitat-manufacturing machines could someday be deployed to the Moon, Mars or beyond to autonomously prepare shelters for the human explorers who follow. On Earth, these capabilities could be used to construct affordable housing wherever needed – where access to conventional building materials and skills are limited. <p></p>   The 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge was formulated in conjunction with the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (aka America Makes). America Makes is the Allied Organization, thus the final arbiter and executioner of all tasks, for the 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge. Centennial Challenges Program is providing the prize money for the 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge.  <p></p>  The 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge will be conducted in two phases: the Design Competition, followed by the two additive manufacturing, or construction, competitions – Level 1 and Level 2 Competitions (to be released in September 2015). Any registered competing individual or team may participate in any or all of the competitions under the umbrella title 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge.  <p></p>  The Design Competition is an architectural design activity which invites competitors to design a habitat which utilizes additive construction advantages over traditional construction. The Design Competition will open registration May 16, 2015, and finalize composite scores on September 27, 2015. Potential competitors will submit a registration package. Accepted competitors will continue to the next step of the Design Competition by submitting a Design Entry. The top 30 competitors will be notified that they may proceed to the next (and final) step of the Design Competition. The top 30 competitors will then finalize the Design Entry and 3D-print a habitat design subscale model.  <p></p>  The 3D subscale model will be displayed at the NYC Maker Faire from September 24, 2015 to September 27, 2015. A composite score will be determined using the Judges’ scoring and public appeal, resulting in an overall ranking. Prizes will be awarded during ceremonies at the NYC Maker Faire on September 27, 2015. <p></p>   The Design Competition will award a first place prize of $25,000, a second place prize of $15,000, and a third place prize of $10,000 (all provided by CCP). America Makes is considering adding additional prizes, such as People’s Choice Award, Honorable Mention, Best in Class, and a Participant Award.</p>
