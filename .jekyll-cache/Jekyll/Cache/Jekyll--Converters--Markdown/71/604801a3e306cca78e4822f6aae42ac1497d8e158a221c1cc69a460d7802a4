<h4><strong>Electronic Synthetic Chemistry Portal for Translational Innovation in Pain, Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Challenge 2</strong> aims to address the need for a next-generation open source electronic lab notebook (eLN) that collects, organizes and analyzes data relevant to the chemical synthesis and analyses of known opioid and non-opioid-based analgesics, drugs of abuse and molecules used to treat drug abuse into an electronic laboratory knowledge portal for synthetic chemistry (electronic synthetic chemistry portal; eSCP).&nbsp; This challenge requires submission of only a detailed description of the design of the eSCP, not the final working portal.&nbsp; The innovators may use currently available. While the focus of this challenge is on a specific translational problem relevant to pain treatments and drug abuse and overdose, the eSCP should be designed to be generally applicable to any kind of laboratory chemical and biological data collection, recording and analysis of data relevant to any translational challenge, be modular; and well architected for advanced machine learning applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The design should address the following judging criteria and will be evaluated based on the potential to achieve these criteria.&nbsp; Winners from this challenge will be strongly encouraged to develop their designs to compete in an envisioned follow-up reduction-to-practice challenge.</p>
<p>Evaluation criteria that reviewers will be asked to address are specified under the "Judging Criteria" tab.</p>

<h4><strong>About NCATS ASPIRE Design Challenges</strong></h4>
<p>The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is inviting novel design solutions for A Specialized Platform for Innovative Research Exploration (<strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong>) Challenges as part of the <strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong> Program. The goal of the <strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges is to reward and spur innovative and catalytic approaches towards solving the opioid crisis through development of: (1) novel chemistries; (2) data-mining and analysis tools and technologies; and (3) biological assays that will revolutionize discovery, development and pre-clinical testing of next generation, safer and non-addictive analgesics to treat pain, as well as new treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose. The first phase of these prize competitions is implemented through a suite of concurrent companion design challenges that comprises a separate challenge for each of four areas: chemistry database, electronic laboratory knowledge portal for synthetic chemistry, algorithms, and biological assays; and an additional challenge for a combined solution to at least two Challenge areas. At this stage, innovators are expected to submit designs, not final products or prototypes.NCATS envisions following these design challenges with a follow-on, but distinct, final reduction-to-practice challenge, which will aim to invoke further scientific and technological development of the model system. Winners of the design challenges will be invited to present their designs so that, in the envisioned follow-up Reduction-to-Practice Challenge, an open competition, teams will be able to form multi-disciplinary collaborations to advance and integrate the most feasible and promising approaches to the multiple challenges into a single integrative platform. Innovators will be invited to demonstrate final solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges are part of the of the NIH&rsquo;s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative will bolster research across NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative.">https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative.</a></p>
<p>NCATS refers to participants in the <strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges as &ldquo;innovators&rdquo; because all solutions will require highly innovative approaches to achieve success. &nbsp;Innovators should clearly state how and why the proposed solution would provide significant advances over currently available tools. Innovators may choose to compete in one or more individual challenges to address a single area (Challenges 1-4) or propose a combined solution for at least two Challenge areas (Challenge 5).<p>For further information send an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:NCATSASPIREChallenge@mail.nih.gov">NCATSASPIREChallenge@mail.nih.gov</a>.</p>
