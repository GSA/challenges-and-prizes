I"R<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ‘Quest for Quakes’ competitors will attempt to develop new software algorithms to uniquely identify the electromagnetic pulses that may precede an earthquake by days to weeks. Competitors use </span>several electromagnetic indicators that may eventually provide short term (weeks to days) warning for large seismic events. These electromagnetic signals or indicators appear to be related to stress-induced release of charge conductors  deep in the earth, near future earthquake hypocenters.  The indicators manifest themselves as unusual magnetic (unipolar) pulses, large increases in air conductivity near the future epicenter, "earthquake lights" (extreme cases of air ionization), and apparent infra red patterns seen near the epicenter as detected via various IR weather and environmental satellites.</p>
