In the first, Solvers will be evaluated on their proposal (including any proposal to scale or grow existing initiatives) to deliver a relevant solution to a PMA-related challenge. The second phase will evaluate invited semi-finalists to share a more in-depth project plan and how this could be executed, as well as how this project supports a longer-term GEAR Center vision. In the third phase, finalists will be invited to present their proposals to a panel of Federal executives through 60-minute virtual meetings.</p> <p>In both phases requiring documents, entries must consist of PDF files with font size no smaller than 11-point Arial. All submissions must be in English. The participants must not use GSA's or OMB&amp;'s logos or official seals in the submissions and must not otherwise give an appearance of Federal government endorsement.</p> <h5><strong>Phase I:&nbsp; Project Proposal, Opens May 2nd &ndash; Deadline to Submit by May 24th at 5:00 PM EST</strong></h5> <p>Solvers submit a no more than two-page proposal (inclusive of any visual representations or graphics), plus the cover sheet specified below, providing the following information:</p> <p>Problem Statement:&nbsp; Describe the PMA-related challenge(s) that your project tackles and any relevant background information.
