I"±<p>The disruption of basic education services due to crisis and conflict situations has long-term consequences for studentsâ€™ educational attainment and development. Technology offers an opportunity to reach and teach learners, who often cannot gather in traditional school settings in periods of such disruption, and prevent the stalling or reversal of educational and literacy gains in affected regions. Education could also provide psycho-social support and promote child and youth well-being in these settings. All Children Reading: A Grand Challenge for Development (ACR GCD) is looking for technology-enabled approaches to provide basic education in one or more of the following crisis or conflict situations: Health Crisis, Natural Disaster, and Conflict Zones.Â Proposed Solutions should be usable within the first six months after the onset of the crisis or conflict and be usable within the context of a developing country.
