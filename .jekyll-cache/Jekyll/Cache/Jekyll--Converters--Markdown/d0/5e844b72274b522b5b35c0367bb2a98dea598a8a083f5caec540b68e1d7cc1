I"ë<p>To enter the Challenge, participants must complete the <a href="https://htnchampions.millionhearts.hhs.gov/">application form</a> on the Million Hearts¬Æ site. The application form is a combination of short answer responses, checkbox responses, and assurances.</p>

<p>Application information includes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The size of the applicant‚Äôs adult patient population defined as the number of adult patients (age 18 years and older) served during the reporting year regardless of diagnosis, a summary of known patient demographics (e.g., age distribution), and any noteworthy patient population characteristics. The reporting year (continuous 12 months) should reflect the most currently available data.</li>
  <li>The percent of the applicant‚Äôs adult patient population identified above that were seen during the reporting year and had a hypertension diagnosis (i.e., hypertension prevalence). There are an estimated 14 million people who are unaware of their hypertension. Most of these people are hiding in plain sight‚Äîthey are in clinical treatment with elevated blood pressure documented, but hypertension neither diagnosed nor treated. Applicants selected as finalists will have their reported hypertension prevalence (i.e., percentage of their practice or system population with the condition) assessed for alignment with their predicted hypertension prevalence. Initially, a rough estimate of the applicant‚Äôs predicted hypertension prevalence will be calculated using the reported age distribution of their patient population and hypertension prevalence findings from national studies, using the <a href="http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/files/MH_HTN_Estimator.xlsm">Million Hearts<sup>¬Æ</sup> Hypertension Prevalence Estimator Tool [Excel-88K]</a>. If the applicant‚Äôs reported prevalence varies considerably from this rough estimate, the applicant may be asked to describe possible reasons for this disparity during the data validation process. If the reported hypertension prevalence is extreme and there is not a justifiable reason, the applicant may be excluded from further participation in the Challenge.</li>
  <li>The hypertension control rate should be for the provider‚Äôs or health system‚Äôs entire adult hypertensive population identified above during the reporting year. The provider‚Äôs or health system‚Äôs hypertensive population ages 18-85 should include only patients in primary care or in cardiology care in the case of a cardiology clinic. Patients seen only in dental care or behavioral health care should not be included. Examples of ineligible data submissions include hypertension control rates that are limited to treatment cohorts from research studies or pilot studies, patients limited to a specific age range (such as 18-35), or patients enrolled in limited scale quality improvement projects. ¬†</li>
  <li>In addition, the hypertension control rate during the previous reporting year is also required. For example, if the current reporting year is January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019, then the previous reporting year should be January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018.</li>
  <li>In determining the hypertension control rate, CDC defines ‚Äúhypertension control‚Äù as a blood pressure reading &lt;140 mmHg systolic and &lt;90 mmHg diastolic among adult hypertensive patients ages 18-85.</li>
  <li>A description of clinic systems or processes that support hypertension control. Checkbox responses may be supplemented by a short answer response. Supporting information about clinic systems is encouraged but not required. Sustainable systems may include provider or patient incentives, dashboards, staffing characteristics, electronic record keeping systems, reminder or alert systems, clinician reporting, service modifications, etc.</li>
  <li>The applicant must agree to:
    <ul>
      <li>Participate in a data validation process, accept the award if selected, and participate in award activities.</li>
      <li>To complete, without revisions, a required Business Associate Agreement form and/or other forms that may be required by applicable law.</li>
      <li>Participate in a 60-minute interview or similar activity to gather information about their hypertension control strategies, and work with CDC on the review of material to share clinical strategies. Strategies used by Champions that support hypertension control may be written into a success story, placed on this website, and attributed to Champions.</li>
      <li>Assume any and all risks and waive claims against the federal government and its related entities except in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue or profits, whether direct, indirect or consequences, arising from participation in this prize contest, whether the injury, death, damage or loss arises through negligence or otherwise.</li>
      <li>Indemnify the federal government against third party claims for damages arising from or related to competition activities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
