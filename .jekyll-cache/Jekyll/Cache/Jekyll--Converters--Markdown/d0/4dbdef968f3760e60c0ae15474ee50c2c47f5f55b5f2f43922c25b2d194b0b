I"æ	<p><strong>Judging Panel:</strong> The NIST Director will select a panel of three qualified judges to determine the Prize Winners. The Judges will determine winners according to the Judging Criteria described herein. The Judges may not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of, any entity that is a registered Participant in the Competition and may not have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a registered Participant. In the event of such conflicts, conflicted Judges must recuse themselves and replacement Judges may be appointed.</p>

<p><strong>Judging Criteria:</strong> The PEER Challenge calls on Participants to submit original ideas that will incentivize recipients of federal R&amp;D funds to comply with the data submission requirements of the Bayh-Dole Act.
Eligible submissions will be judged and scored on four judging criteria, listed below. 
Ideas submitted to this challenge that have previously been published or that have been prepared using Federal funds are not eligible (e.g., Federal agency reports, reports prepared by Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, or reports prepared by funded intermediaries on behalf of Federal agencies.)
Judges will evaluate and score eligible submissions using four judging criteria:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Practicality in terms of being able to implement the proposed solutions (15 points)</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Participants should consider the ability of federal agencies and fund recipients to implement the incentives.</li>
      <li>Participants should consider realistic cost vs. benefit of proposed incentives.</li>
      <li>Participants should consider the applicable laws and regulations.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Likelihood of increasing compliance with meeting Bayh-Dole reporting requirements (15 points): Participants should explicitly address how the incentive(s) will greatly increase compliance.</li>
  <li>Relevance of success metrics in terms of how the increase in compliance would be measured by the proposed solution, including cost-benefit (15 points).</li>
  <li>
    <p>Creativity of the proposed solution (5 points)</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Participants may consider the creation of videos, posters, design concepts, and other creative products. Submissions should be professional, high-quality products.</li>
