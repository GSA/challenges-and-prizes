I"¿(<p>The mission of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission‚Äôs (‚ÄúCFTC‚Äù) is to promote the integrity, resilience, and vibrancy of the U.S. derivatives markets through sound regulation. As part of this mission, the CFTC regulates a variety of individuals and organizations. These include futures commission merchants, commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisors, retail foreign exchange dealers, introducing brokers, designated contract markets, foreign boards of trade, swap dealers, and other entities and individuals. To promote market integrity, the CFTC surveils the derivatives markets for various abuses, and holds wrongdoers accountable.</p>

<p>Increasingly, fraudsters use a variety of social engineering, fake profiling, and manipulative techniques to ensnare their victims. Fraud tactics regularly employ common keywords and phrases. With this information, there is an opportunity to utilize modern technology as a tool to augment traditional, manual efforts and to identify bad actors.</p>

<p>The CFTC is vigilant to protect customers from unscrupulous fraudsters, including those operating outside the U.S. LabCFTC is launching this competition (‚ÄúProject Streetlamp‚Äù) to call on innovators to utilize technology, including artificial intelligence (‚ÄúAI‚Äù), and innovative approaches to detect foreign entities that should be ‚Äì but are not ‚Äìregistered with the CFTC. The competition is intended to generate information that ultimately helps customers make more informed decisions about whether to trade with, or through, these unregistered foreign entities.</p>

<p><strong>The RED List</strong></p>

<p>The Registration Deficient List, or ‚Äú<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/Resources/Check/redlist.htm">RED List</a>,‚Äù provides public notice that a foreign entity is engaged in conduct that requires registration with the CFTC, but has not in fact registered. Generally, foreign entities that solicit U.S. residents to trade in CFTC-regulated markets are required to register with the CFTC. Registration provides both a legal framework that includes safeguards and client protections, as well as mechanisms for recourse in the event an issue arises.</p>

<p>The goal of the RED List is to provide information to U.S. customers about foreign entities that are acting in an unregistered capacity and to help them make more informed decisions about whether to trade with or through such an entity. While registration is no guarantee against fraud or mismanagement by an otherwise unscrupulous firm or individual, registration does bring a higher level of security and accountability to the trading public. Customers that trade with and through registered entities have greater protections and recourse available.</p>

<p>In certain cases, a review by the CFTC reveals that certain foreign entities solicit and/or accept funds from U.S. customers, have limited or no U.S. presence, and may be acting in a capacity that requires registration, but yet are <em>not</em> registered with the CFTC. After such review, foreign entities which meet the RED List criteria are included on the RED List.</p>

<p>The process to update and maintain the RED List relies on tips and referrals from concerned individuals as well as investigative work by CFTC staff. The work is time-intensive. Given the scope of global markets, range of participants, and limited resources, the process could benefit from technology applications, including those that leverage AI, which can identify and flag potentially problematic activity for further follow-up by CFTC staff. This may enable a more efficient and comprehensive search and review process to identify foreign entities for inclusion on the RED List. Also, it could enable the CFTC to be proactive in its ongoing efforts to maintain the RED List. Currently, it is only after wrongdoing is <em>reported</em> that an entity is investigated for possible enforcement action or inclusion on the RED List.</p>

<h4 id="competition">Competition</h4>

<p>The goal of Project Streetlamp is to explore how AI and other technologies can help the CFTC maintain a comprehensive, up-to-date RED List by automating the process of identifying foreign entities potentially engaged in CFTC-regulated activity.  AI could be an important component of such a tool, because the technology has the potential to learn the ‚Äúfootprints‚Äù of actors that are unregistered, but engaged in CFTC-regulated activity. For example, key identifying data (<em>e.g.</em>, keywords, website data, audience information, network and outreach, etc.) associated with unregistered entities known to be engaged in CFTC-regulated activity could be used to develop a model that is useful for identifying other unknown entities.</p>

<p>Participants will develop a tool to identify companies engaged in activity that the CFTC should investigate further for possible inclusion on the RED List. Such activity may include, but is not limited to: soliciting or accepting customers‚Äô orders; soliciting discretionary accounts; directing customer accounts; providing commodity trading advice; or operating a commodity pool. This information may also help identify broader trends or behavior that the CFTC finds helpful to target customer education and awareness efforts.</p>

<h4 id="red-list-inclusion-criteria">RED List Inclusion Criteria</h4>

<p>The following criteria may help competition participants develop a tool that can appropriately identify foreign entities that should be included on the CFTC‚Äôs RED List.</p>

<p><em>1.  Is the entity foreign?</em></p>

<p>Only foreign entities are included on the RED List. For purposes of the tool, an entity is foreign if its place of business is anywhere other than the U.S. An entity may not be domestic simply because it self-identifies as having a physical presence in the U.S.</p>

<p><em>2.  Does the foreign entity have any or a limited U.S. presence?</em></p>

<p>For purposes of the tool, an entity that has only a limited U.S. presence may still be considered a ‚Äúforeign entity‚Äù and included on the RED List. An entity will be considered to have a limited U.S. presence if its only presence is: a virtual office; a sham address; a U.S. phone number; or its website or domain hosting service. An entity that has more than a limited U.S. presence is not considered a ‚Äúforeign entity,‚Äù and therefore the tool should not designate it for the RED List. For this purpose, indicia of a U.S. presence may include, among other things, whether an entity has: a U.S. agent or representative; a bank or other financial account(s) held by a financial institution in the U.S; a physical office space; or any other substantive presence in the U.S.</p>

<p><em>3.  Does the foreign entity appear to solicit or accept U.S.-based residents?</em></p>

<p>For purposes of the tool, an entity solicits a U.S. resident if, from a U.S.-based IP address: a U.S. resident is able to open an account with the entity; or the entity does not block a U.S. resident from opening an account.</p>

<p><em>4.  Does the foreign entity offer products within the CFTC‚Äôs jurisdiction, including for example, futures, options on futures (‚Äúoptions‚Äù), foreign currency (‚Äúforex‚Äù), binary options, leveraged metals, contracts for difference (‚ÄúCFD‚Äù), or Bitcoin derivatives (and any other virtual currency contracts regulated by the CFTC)?</em></p>

<p>Where an unregistered foreign entity offers futures, options, forex, CFDs, or other derivatives subject to CFTC jurisdiction to U.S. customers the tool should consider this a positive factor for inclusion on the RED List.</p>

<p><em>5.  Is the foreign entity required to be registered with the CFTC?</em></p>

<p>For purposes of the tool, conduct in connection with a CFTC jurisdictional product that requires registration with the CFTC may include, among other things: accepting customer funds; soliciting or accepting customers‚Äô orders; soliciting discretionary accounts; directing customer accounts; providing commodity trading advice; or operating a commodity pool.</p>

<p><em>6.  Is the foreign entity currently not registered with the CFTC?</em></p>

<p>The National Futures Association‚Äôs public registration database at <a href="https://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet">https://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet</a> includes entities that are registered with the CFTC. If an entity is registered or has an exemption from registration, the tool should not designate it for inclusion on the RED List.</p>

<p><em>7.  In the case of binary options, is the foreign entity currently not registered as a Foreign Board of Trade (‚ÄúFBOT‚Äù)?</em></p>

<p>The CFTC maintains a <a href="https://sirt.cftc.gov/sirt/sirt.aspx?Topic=ForeignBoardsofTrade">database of registered FBOT‚Äôs</a>. If an entity is registered as an FBOT, the tool should not designate it for inclusion on the RED List.</p>

<h4 id="outputs">Outputs</h4>

<p>For purposes of this contest, successful tools will use AI and/or other technology to scan public sources and relevant data. To accomplish this, a tool should be able to assess foreign entities against the criteria listed above in order to generate a report that identifies foreign entities for potential inclusion on the RED List. To the extent possible, the output should include the foreign entity‚Äôs name and/or ‚Äúdoing business as‚Äù name, country of origin, owners/operators, and contact information (phone, email, social media, website(s), and/or address(es)), as may be available. The tool should also be able to provide a justification based on the criteria above for why any particular foreign entity has been identified.</p>

<p>Finally, the tool should incorporate an archive function that saves searches and results for future reference and audit purposes.</p>

<p>Participants will determine the best approach to create their tool and to deploy it, as well as the format of the report and output that is generated. The output may be in any machine readable format (<em>e.g.</em>, csv, xml, excel) to facilitate further analysis.</p>
