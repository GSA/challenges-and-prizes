I"Ò<p>We are seeking to rapidly innovate and prototype a web-based platform to ingest globally available data and based upon user inputs for desired topics of focus, synthesize relevant information for enhanced operational awareness and improved decision-making.&nbsp; The tool should depict the information graphically in a way to promote intuitive appreciation for the relevant connections between different elements of information.&nbsp; The desired product may incorporate vetting of source contributors but should allow for machine-based learning to increase speed of information synthesis and enhance data quality and accuracy over time.</p>
<p>With the digital explosion of data and information, leaders in complex organizations find it increasingly difficult to find, glean, and absorb information relevant to the issues they confront on a daily basis.&nbsp; At the same time, emerging technology in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality will almost certainly offer potential solutions to mitigate the information overload problem.</p>
<p>We are looking for your concept for an adaptive software tool to integrate open-source, disparate bits of information into a coherent picture for a customer to use to make informed decisions.&nbsp; The ultimate goal of this process is to award contract(s) to develop and deploy a working prototype at the Air University, Maxwell AFB, AL.<br /> <br /> <strong>Posting a Solution</strong><br /> Solutions can be submitted between the start and end dates published below. Late solutions will not be allowed, and only solutions submitted on the Challenge submission site will be accepted for consideration.&nbsp; The submission platform requires a written summary of your concept, which will be visible or &ldquo;open&rdquo; to any registered user of the submission platform.&nbsp; There is a provision to upload your White Paper to a location that is only visible to the USAF customer and MGMWERX.&nbsp; No information that is declared to be proprietary information will be made public, unless posted in a public field on the submission form.</p>
<div>Solutions Phase Start:&nbsp; 6/25/2019 @ 11:00 AM CST</div>
<div>Solutions Phase End:&nbsp; 7/30/2019 @ 11:59 PM CST</div>
<div><br /> <strong>USAF Review, Selection, and Invitation</strong> <br /> During this phase, a team of USAF customers will review solution proposals. The top solution(s) meeting the specified requirements will be invited to participate in a design sprint phase beginning in late August 2019.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Selection Phase Start:&nbsp; 8/01/2019</div>
<div>Selection Phase End:&nbsp; 8/07/2019</div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Design Sprint</strong><br /> During this phase, invited solution providers will participate in a design workshop to refine the product specifications.&nbsp; Competitors will have the opportunity to refine their design, based on revised specifications, and at the end of this phase, will pitch their updated design.&nbsp; The deliverable at this stage is a shell of the software product to demonstrate the look and feel of the anticipated product, along with a detailed White Paper to thoroughly describe the planned features of the design.&nbsp; At the end of this Design Sprint phase, the USAF customer team will review the updated designs and select a single provider to develop the prototype.</p>
<div>Design Sprint Phase Start:&nbsp; 8/19/2019</div>
<div>Design Sprint Phase End:&nbsp; 9/06/2019</div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Prototype Generation Phase</strong><br /> During this phase, the selected vendor will be compensated to create the prototype of the Atmospherics Generator.</p>
