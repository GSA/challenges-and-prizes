I"Æ<p>The focus of the HHS Health Game Jam is the creation of games that address health priorities championed by HHS and CDC. We encourage participants to think outside the box with exergaming, mobile/spatial games, and games that utilize geolocation data to create innovative experiences.    The jam is free, but admission will be first-come/first-served, based on date of registration. We expect this to be our largest jam to date, so register early!</p>
