<p>Science seeks to answer questions about ourselves and the world around us. Many times, the most important discoveries are completely unexpected ‚Äì like when a moldy dish left out during vacation leads to the discovery of a vital medicine, penicillin! But, if something is unexpected, how can we prepare for positive and/or negative outcomes? When it comes to understanding the brain, enter: Neuroethics! Careful scientists must consider ethics during their research, including preparing for unanticipated consequences of exciting scientific advances. This challenge is seeking creative essays or videos from currently enrolled U.S. high school students that describe a teen‚Äôs perspective on the ethics, limitations, and implications of emerging technology to study and treat disorders of the human brain.</p>

<p>At the National Institutes of Health, the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies¬Æ¬†(BRAIN) Initiative is funding researchers to revolutionize our understanding of the human brain. Currently, BRAIN Initiative researchers are developing a variety of devices to study the human brain and to treat brain disorders, such as Parkinson‚Äôs disease, epilepsy, depression, etc. Some of these devices are implanted directly into the brain, while others can operate without needing to physically access the brain. Some of these devices can be used to stimulate activity in specific brain regions for treatment purposes, while others are used to record brain activity. While these devices are opening the doors to new discoveries, they also raise potentially new ethical questions.</p>

<p>The field that studies the ethical, legal, and societal implications of neuroscience is called neuroethics. Below are some neuroethics topics and questions to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Brain data gathered to answer a research question and/or provide clinical benefit:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Who owns the data and who should be able to access it?</li>
      <li>What information should be shared and what should remain private?</li>
      <li>How should the data be stored?</li>
      <li>How should the data be used and for what purposes?</li>
      <li>Brain data could lead to predictions about human nature. Who is responsible for these predictions and how they are used? For example, how do algorithms consider or use data on age, gender, race or ethnicity to make predictions on human behavior?</li>
      <li>As brain data is collected, who is it collected from? How does the sampled data generalize to broader populations, and how does that impact the predictions and conclusions inferred from the data?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Special considerations associated with novel brain devices that alter or record brain activity, either implanted or from outside the head:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Who is responsible for the maintenance of brain devices?</li>
      <li>When data is remotely collected from a brain device, how should we make sure it is collected securely? Is there a security risk?</li>
      <li>How could brain devices that adjust themselves using artificial intelligence affect a person‚Äôs agency or the capacity to act independently and to make their own free choices?</li>
      <li>What is the appropriate action when an implanted device improves disease symptoms but dramatically changes the individual‚Äôs personality?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Informed consent issues, specifically pertaining to studies using novel brain technologies:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Should the informed consent forms be the same for all studies?</li>
      <li>What is the participant perspective on informed consent? How do participants view the informed consent process and the information they are given?</li>
      <li>How should informed consent differ for vulnerable populations, like children, pregnant women, and/or those with disabilities or cognitive impairment?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Translation of new tools and technologies for neuroscience research to contexts beyond the original treatment or research purpose or goals:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Should technologies be used for purposes outside of the original research and/or treatment of health conditions? Where should the limitations be drawn?</li>
      <li>Should brain technologies be marketed and commercialized like other products? Who should decide what can or cannot be marketed, and by whom?</li>
      <li>What are the conflicts of interest that should be considered if commercializing brain technologies, particularly for alternate uses?‚Ä®</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Submissions to this challenge are essays and/or videos, submitted via the BRAIN Initiative Challenge campaign of <a href="https://ninds.ideascalegov.com/">https://ninds.ideascalegov.com</a>, that include creative ideas to start a conversation about a neuroethical topic using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Writing:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Two-page/1000-word essay (max length, excluding references), 11 or 12 point font; Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri preferred.</li>
      <li>Essays must be written in English, by a single individual and submitted in.doc, .txt, or .pdf file format.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or Video:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Videos must be no longer than 5 minutes. Videos must be submitted via an <strong>unlisted YouTube link</strong> to a streaming-optimized .MP4 in 649X448 resolution, no larger than 100MB.¬†</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Any individuals videotaped must provide, or have a legal parent or guardian provide, consent by signing a Media Release Form. The Media Release form can be found on the BRAIN Initiative Challenge campaign of <a href="https://ninds.ideascalegov.com">https://ninds.ideascalegov.com</a>. Signed files must be provided at submission.</li>
          <li>A transcript of the video should be provided (.doc, .txt, or .pdf) at submission.</li>
          <li>Videos may include audio in languages other than English but must have English subtitles.</li>
          <li>All entrants must upload their video to YouTube and provide the unlisted link on the submission form. See ‚ÄúHow to Enter‚Äù for more details.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Videos may be submitted by a ‚ÄúPrimary Video Producer‚Äù on behalf of a single individual or a team (no more than 5 individuals). While filmmaking may be a group effort, the development of different components (e.g. writing, editing, even filming) is <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> to be done remotely, using virtual collaboration methods due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals who chose to work together should practice appropriate social distancing and follow the public health guidance from the CDC (for more information, go to  <a href="https://www.coronavirus.gov/">https://www.coronavirus.gov/</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>
The BRAIN Initiative is aimed at revolutionizing our understanding of the human brain. The United States BRAIN Initiative includes multiple federal and non-federal groups working together to coordinate these research efforts (<a href="https://www.braininitiative.org/">https://www.braininitiative.org/</a>). By accelerating the development and application of innovative technologies, researchers will be able to produce a revolutionary new dynamic picture of the brain in action. Long desired by researchers seeking new ways to treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders, this picture will fill major gaps in our current knowledge and provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring exactly how the brain enables us to record, process, utilize, store, and retrieve vast quantities of information, all at the speed of thought.</p>

<p>The National Institutes of Health is the largest funder of biomedical research in the United States (<a href="https://www.nih.gov/">https://www.nih.gov/</a>). It is made up of 27 different components called Institutes and Centers. Each has its own with specific research mission, often focusing on a particular disease or body system. The NIH BRAIN Initiative is a group effort by NIH, managed by the 10 Institutes and Centers whose missions include the study of vision, hearing, neurological disorders, mental health, child health, aging, drug and alcohol abuse, bioengineering, and complementary health.</p>
