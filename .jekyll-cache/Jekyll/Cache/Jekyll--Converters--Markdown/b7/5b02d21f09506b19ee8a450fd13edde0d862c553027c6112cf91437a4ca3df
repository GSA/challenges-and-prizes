I"¦<p>NIBIBâ€™sÂ  DEBUT Challenge is open to teams of undergraduate students working on projects that develop innovative solutions to unmet health and clinical problems. NIBIBâ€™s mission is to improve health by leading the development and accelerating the application of biomedical technologies.<p></p> The goals of the challenge are <br />1) to provide undergraduate students valuable experiences such as working in teams, identifying unmet clinical needs, and designing, building and debugging solutions for such open-ended problems; <br />2) to generate novel, innovative tools to improve healthcare, consistent with NIBIBâ€™s purpose to support research, training, the dissemination of health information, and other programs with respect to biomedical imaging and engineering and associated technologies and modalities with biomedical applications; and <br />3) to highlight and acknowledge the contributions and accomplishments of undergraduate students.<p></p>To participate in the challenge, a team of undergraduate students must identify an unmet health/clinical need, and design and build a biomedicalÂ  technology/methodÂ  that addresses it.Â  Areas of interest for these design projects include, but are not limited to, diagnostics, therapeutics, technologies for underserved populations and low resource settings, point-of-care systems, precision medicine, preventive medicine and technologies to aid individuals with disabilities.</p>
