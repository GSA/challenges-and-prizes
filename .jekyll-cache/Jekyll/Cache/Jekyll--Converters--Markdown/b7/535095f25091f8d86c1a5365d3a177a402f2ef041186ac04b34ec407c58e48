	<li>A completed project packet. This includes registration information, a description of the visualization with intended impact and the story it tells.Â  All data and information sources used in the visualization must be provided and not exceed 5 pages (see <a href="https://esri.app.box.com/vywgettingstartedguide" target="_blank">Getting Started Guide</a>); and</li>

Use of credible and publicly available open data sets (both governmental and non-governmental) may be used. GIS software must be used for submissions. The geographic scale of the project can range from just a single local waterway up the entire watershed; clear and powerful analysis and presentation are more important than a specific geographic extent.</p>
