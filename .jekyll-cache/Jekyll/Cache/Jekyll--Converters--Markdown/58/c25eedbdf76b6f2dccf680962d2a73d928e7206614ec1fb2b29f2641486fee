I"å<p>Many in-home patients require the daily use of a piece of electrically powered durable medical equipment (DME).  During a disaster or other event that leads to a prolonged power outage, these patients often end up at shelters or emergency rooms looking for sources of power or alternate ways to manage their medical needs. We need a reliable system available to identify, locate, and assist these individuals in a timely fashion. Proposals should be detailed and implementable.</p>
