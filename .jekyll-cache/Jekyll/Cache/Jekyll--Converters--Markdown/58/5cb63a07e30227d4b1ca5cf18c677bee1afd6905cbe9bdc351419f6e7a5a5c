I"f<p>Submissions to this prize competition shall include:  <p></p>  (1)     A comprehensive description including drawings and diagrams, as appropriate, of the proposed solution in 10 pages or less, 8.5 x 11 inch page, 12-point font or greater and one inch margins including:    <br />(i)         A one-paragraph executive summary that clearly states the technical question to be solved;   <br /> (ii)       Background information supporting the significance of the technical question(s) and the proposed approach, pitfalls, and validation scheme that addresses efforts to support reproducibility; if possible, citing selected peer-reviewed articles that strengthen the proposed solution;   <br /> (iii)     Descriptions of methods and technologies key to implementation;  <br />  (iv)       A “state-of-the-art” statement that describes approaches currently in use (if any) and clearly explains how the methods and measures proposed advance existing capabilities; and  <br />  (v)         A feasibility assessment and a statement describing your ability to execute the proposed solution, including the estimated timeframe, supporting precedents and any special resource you may have or will need.  <p></p>  Judging: Solutions for this competition will be evaluated by a judging panel using the criteria and rating scales described below. Judges will review highly rated solutions for technical alignment to the Next Generation First Responder Apex program, relevance to the DHS mission, and potential integration with existing projects.  <p></p>  The three use cases, listed under (1) below, apply to this competition and, at a minimum; at least two of these must be addressed. The judging panel will use the following criteria and rating scales for evaluating proposed solutions with high scores reflecting the most highly rated solutions: (Maximum 100 points; plus up to 50 bonus points)  <p></p>  (1)     Building structure (0-30 points) -    (i)         Case 1 – Should be able to track multiple first responders inside of a 2-story residential structure above and below grade;    (ii)       Case 2 – Should be able to track multiple first responders inside of a warehouse structure with a minimal footprint of 20,000 square feet;    (iii)     Case 3 – Should be able to track multiple first responders inside of a multi-storied commercial building above grade and below grade.  <p></p>  (2)     Location Accuracy (0-50 points) - Location capability should provide 3-dimentional positioning where X is less than or equal to 3 meters with a position error of less than equal to +/- 0.50 meters; where Y is less than or equal to 3 meters with a position error of less than equal to +/- 0.50 meters; and where Z is less than or equal to 2 meters with a position error of less than equal to +/- 0.25 meters.  <p></p>  (3)     Real-time reporting (0-10 points) - The solution should be able to provide real-time reporting of +/- 15 seconds to the on-scene commander and must be able to transmit, omni-directional, position location no less than 1500 feet from within the structure.  <p></p>  (4)     The modular form should be man-portable and weigh less than 5 pounds (0 – 10 points).  <ul>   <li>Bonus Points (Maximum 50 bonus points) -</li>  </ul>  (i)         Feasibility (Bonus worth up to 30 points) - Solvers should provide sufficient details to support the feasibility that the proposed solution can be demonstrated with further research and development in less than two years, including published or unpublished data, scientific basis, technological capability, and resources.   <br /> (ii)       Adaptability (Bonus worth up to 20 points) - Must describe broad utility and scalability. The approach should lend itself to more than one first responder discipline, such as law enforcement, firefighting, and emergency medical services.</p>
