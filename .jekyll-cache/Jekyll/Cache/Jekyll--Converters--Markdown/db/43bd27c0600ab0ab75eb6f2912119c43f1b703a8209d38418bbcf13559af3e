I"&)<h4 id="judging-panel"><strong>Judging Panel</strong></h4>

<p>The NIST Director will appoint a panel of three qualified judges. The Judges will be robot agility and/or simulation experts from inside and/or outside of NIST. The Judges will determine winners according to the Judging Criteria described herein. The Judges may not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of, any entity that is a registered Participant in the Competition and may not have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a registered Participant. In the event of such a conflict, a Judge must recuse himself or herself and a new Judge may be appointed.</p>

<h4 id="basis-on-which-finalists-and-winners-will-be-selected">Basis on which Finalists and Winners will be selected</h4>

<p>A qualifier will be performed approximately one month before the finals. The automated metrics described below will be used in the qualifier to determine which team(s) progress to the finals.  As described in the Judging Criteria below, these same automated metrics will also be used in the finals, in conjunction with the judging panel.</p>

<p>A portion of the scores will be automatically calculated, shared with the Participants, and publicly posted for each Trial at the conclusion of the Finals (after all Trials are run) as a combination of cost and performance metrics, described below in the Trial Score Calculation section. A Participant’s final automated score is the sum of scores for each of the 15 competition Trials.</p>

<p><strong>Cost Metrics</strong></p>

<p>The following values are calculated for a Participant’s system setup. As Participants are to use the same system setup for all Trials, the values will remain unchanged between Trials.</p>

<p>The choices made by the competitors (choices of sensors) will have a specific cost associated with them. The final cost for individual sensors will be made available to the Participants at least two weeks before the Finals. For planning purposes, Participants should use the values laid out on the Event Website: <a href="https://www.nist.gov/el/intelligent-systems-division-73500/agile-robotics-industrial-automation-competition">nist.gov/ariac</a>.</p>

<p>The sum of these cost choices made by each team will be compared to the baseline cost set by the competition administrators (which will be announced on the Event Website: <a href="https://www.nist.gov/el/intelligent-systems-division-73500/agile-robotics-industrial-automation-competition">nist.gov/ariac</a>) and made into a cost factor for the scoring. The team costs are designated as TC, and the baseline cost is designated as BC. The cost factor, is then calculated as:</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/ariac_costformula.png" alt="Cost Formula " /></p>

<p><strong>Completion Score</strong></p>

<p>Performance metrics that cover both completion and efficiency are calculated for each Trial separately. Completion captures the quality of the orders fulfilled (that the kit trays contain the correct products in the correct position/orientations and colors, if applicable); efficiency captures the responsiveness in fulfilling orders (that the orders were filled quickly).</p>

<p>Each trial, since it has the option to have more than one order, will have a certain set of scores for each order. Each order consists of a list of products needed and a prescribed position and orientation for each product within the box. The completion score, CS, is a combined score for each order, starting with 1 point for each product that is placed in the box. For each part that is the correct color (if applicable), an additional 1 point is awarded. For each product that is within 3 cm of the correct position, and within 0.1 radians of the correct orientation will result in an additional point. Next, since the main focus of the competition is to have fulfilled orders, any order with all of the products in the confines of the box, of the correct color (if applicable), and in the correct position/orientation receives an additional point for each product. So, for an order kj with i products in it would have a maximum score of 4i points.</p>

<p><strong>Efficiency Factor</strong></p>

<p>The Efficiency of the approaches chosen by the teams are accounted for in the scoring by using the times that each team takes to complete each trial. The times are counted in seconds from the start of the trial until the first kit is completed and is designated as T01. In the trials with multiple orders, the time, Ti is counted in seconds from the time that the ith order is sent to the team. For each trial, an average of the times across the teams (ATi) is compared to the individual team time to calculate the Efficiency Factor:</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/ariac_efficiencyfactorformula.png" alt="Efficiency Factor formula" /></p>

<p>If a team’s system times out for a trial, the efficiency factor for the trial is set to 0 and the trial time is not used to calculate the average times for that trial.</p>

<p>For the multi-order trials where one of the orders is a high priority order, an additional multiplier, h, is applied with the efficiency factor to give a higher proportion of the score to that order, which is initially set to a value of 3. The final h value will be made available to the Participants at least two weeks before the finals.</p>

<p><strong>Trial Score Calculation</strong></p>

<p>All of the scoring factors described above are combined as shown below to calculate the score for each trial:</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/ariac_fullscoreformula.png" alt="Score calculation" /></p>

<p>For the trials where there is no second, higher priority, order, the following modifications are used: CSK2 = CSK1 , EF2 = 0. This results in the simplified scoring equation:</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/ariac_simplifiedscoreformula.png" alt="Score calculation formula when trial had no priority order" /></p>

<p><strong>Final Rank Score Calculation</strong></p>

<p>The final rank score is the equally weighted sum of all trial scores. As mentioned in the Competition Scenarios section, trials are expected to focus on the Baseline Kit Building, Dropped Part, and In-Process Kit Change scenarios, among others.</p>

<p><strong>Winners:</strong> The Winners of cash prizes will be determined by three Judges appointed by the NIST Director, using the Judging Criteria outlined herein.</p>

<p>For each entry, the Judges will receive the video output for each competition trial run in the simulated environment, along with the description of the agility challenges that were being tested in each trial. The Judges will not receive the automated scores that are generated as part of each ARIAC trial.</p>

<h4 id="judging-criteria">Judging Criteria</h4>

<p>Each Judge will provide a single score per entry, out of 20 total points, based on the Judging Criteria listed below. This score should provide an overall impression of the entire entry across all trials. Each Judge will provide their score independently to the Challenge Manager, Craig Schlenoff, without interaction with other Judges. The average of these three scores will be added to the points from the automated score to determine the competition winner. In the event of a tie score (or scores), the Challenge Manager will convene the three judges to determine winners by consensus.</p>

<p>The overall score will be broken down as follows:</p>

<p>Overall Score:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Overall Performance based on the automated scoring metrics described above (80 points): Using the automated scoring metrics described herein, the first-place entry will be awarded 80 points, the second-place entry will be awarded 70 points, the third-place entry will be awarded 60 points, and so on.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Average of Judge Scoring (20 points): The judges will provide a total score of 20 points, broken down as follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Novelty/Innovativeness: Approach taken develops new techniques to advance industry robot agility (Up to six points)</li>
      <li>Ability for Industry to Implement: Approach taken can reasonably be applied by industry to solve similar challenges. (Up to six points)</li>
      <li>Alignment with the Spirit of the Competition: Approach taken provides a practical and realistic approach that directly addresses the stated goals of the ARIAC Competition. (Up to eight points)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>NIST will announce the Finalists via the Event Website as well as those Finalists that have been awarded a cash award (each, an “Award”). The anticipated number and amount of the Awards that will be awarded for this Competition is set forth in these rules; however, NIST is not obligated to make all or any Awards, and reserves the right to award fewer than the anticipated number of Awards in the event an insufficient number of eligible Participants meet any one or more of the Judging Criteria for this Competition, based on NIST’s sole discretion. Using the Judging Criteria described herein, three qualified Judges (appointed by the NIST Director) will determine the winners of the ARIAC Prize Competition.</p>

<p>The winner verification process for being eligible to receive an Award includes providing the full legal name, tax identification number or social security number, routing number and banking account to which the prize money can be deposited directly. Return of any notification as “undeliverable” will result in disqualification. The verification form must be returned within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt. After verification of eligibility, Awards will be distributed in the form of electronic funds transfer addressed to the Official Representatives specified in the winning entries. That Official Representative will have sole responsibility for further distribution of any Award among Participants in a group entry or within a company or institution that has submitted an entry through that representative. The list of entries receiving Awards for the Competition, including the names of all members of a team, will be made public according to the timeline outlined on the Event Website.</p>

<p>Winners are responsible for all taxes and reporting related to any Award received as part of the Competition.</p>

<p>All costs incurred in the preparation of Competition entries are to be borne by Participants.</p>
