<p><em><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica;"><strong><em>
</em></strong></span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica;">In order for an entry to be eligible to win the Challenge, it must meet the following requirements:</span></strong></em></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica;">Deliverable: Must be an image or browser viewable file. The acceptable image formats: .PNG, .JPG, .GIF, .TIFF, and .PDF.Â There is no limit to how many designs you may submit and how many imagesÂ are used toÂ representÂ a design, however, each individual file has a size limit of 3MB. If you are submitting multiple image files, please be sure to label each file andÂ <span style="font-family: Helvetica;">includeÂ a table of contents so that it is clear to judges the order in which they should be reviewed</span>.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica;">Feasibility: The Challenge requires only that the design of the taxpayer experience be submitted. It is not the responsibility of the entrant to build or code a working version of the design. However, the design must be ultimately implementable using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica;">Data: The design should use some or all of the variables in the Tax Data Document (TDD) for an improved experience. Use of every variable in the TDD is not required; submissions may include additional variables that are not in the TDD.</span></p>
