I"˜<p>Participants must be a group of individuals (i.e., a team assembled with the purpose of participating in this Challenge). Each team is required to identify a team leader who registers and submits a required Submission Package on behalf of the team. The team leader must send the completed registration form and all submission materials to <a href="mailto:NIDAChallenge@nih.gov">NIDAChallenge@nih.gov</a> with the subject line ‚Äú<strong>Start a SUD Startup Submission Package</strong>‚Äù by the specified submission deadline date and time. You can <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/2021_Start_SUD_Startup_Registration_Form.docx">download the registration form here</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Submission Requirements</em></strong></p>

<p>Each submission for this Challenge requires a complete Submission Package. The Submission Package includes the registration form, a 4-page written proposal describing the idea, and a 5-minute video introducing the team (see requirements below for the proposal and video). Both the idea and the 5-minute video will be evaluated. Submissions that do not follow the format described below will be disqualified and removed from the prize considerations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Proposal.</strong> The proposal must consist of a PDF file with at least 1-inch margins and be no more than four (4) pages long. Font size must be no smaller than 11-point Arial. All submissions must be in English. The participants must not use the HHS logo or official seal or the logo of NIH or NIDA in the submissions and must not claim federal government endorsement.</p>

    <p><strong><em>In the proposal:</em></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Idea Description.</strong> Describe how your research idea would further an understanding of SUD and be the foundation for a successful startup. The research idea must be defensible and evidence based. (1 page)</li>
      <li><strong>Team Technical Competence and Research Experience.</strong> Convince the Challenge judges of your technical competence. Be brief, persuasive, and only present the relevant information. Do not use the NIH Bibliographic Sketch format. (0.5 page)</li>
      <li><strong>Prototype Description and Step-by-Step Use of Final Product, as Envisioned.</strong> Describe, in as many details as possible, what the prototype of your envisioned product would look like. Then, walk the Challenge judges through the typical use of the product, using simple terms and instructions. (1.5 pages)</li>
      <li><strong>Need Validation.</strong> Explain the methods you will use (how, when, where, whom) to determine whether the product is needed by the target customer and whether that end user/customer would be willing to pay for the product. (1 page)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Video.</strong> A brief 5-minute video must be posted to YouTube and the link to the video provided. In contrast to the proposal, the video is intended to introduce the team, not the research idea. The team and its people are the most important evaluation criteria for entrepreneurial success.</p>

    <p><strong><em>In the YouTube video:</em></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>In one minute or less, tell NIDA who on your team is the lead ‚Äúhacker,‚Äù also known as technical lead, with the skills to develop your product and to focus on the available technology options and requirements.</li>
      <li>In one minute or less, tell NIDA who on your team is the lead ‚Äúhipster,‚Äù also known as the end user/customer need lead, the person concerned with the customer experience and design. This team member understands the end-user of your product and focuses on the medical and healthcare delivery issues (most often, a practicing SUD physician, clinical department manager, etc.).</li>
      <li>In one minute or less, tell NIDA who on your team is the lead ‚Äúhustler,‚Äù also known as the business or entrepreneurial lead, with the skills or aspirations to focus on the overall business objectives, customer definition, business plan, etc.</li>
      <li>Tell NIDA how long you have known each other and relay something that can illustrate the drive or the desire of each team member to become a startup founder.</li>
      <li>What unique skill set, background, or experience does this team have that has led them to pursue this idea?</li>
      <li>Tell NIDA something about each team member that demonstrates a high level of perseverance and grit.</li>
      <li>Tell NIDA about a time when your great idea was rejected. What was your response?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
