<p>The xTechHBCU competition is voluntary and open to all U.S.-based institutions that meet the eligibility requirements.  Multiple submissions, i.e., more than one (1), addressing different problem statements/topics will be accepted from eligible entities. The registration information and upload submission must be received by <strong>5:00 PM ET on October 1, 2021.</strong>  Submissions received after the deadline will not be considered.</p>

<p>To receive prize money, entities are required to register in System for Award Management (SAM) and have or obtain an active CAGE code, DUNS number, and not be on the exclusions lists (debarred or suspended). Instructions on how to obtain a CAGE code can be found on the xTechHBCU registration page.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility Requirements</strong></p>

<p>The entities allowed to participate in this competition must be from covered institutions that have historically received less funding than their counterparts, such as non-Tier 1 (R1) colleges and universities, with the intent to fund institutions that have not otherwise received a significant amount of funding from the DoD RDT&amp;E programs.</p>

<p>As provided in 10 U.S.C. § 2362, eligibility for this competition is open only to “covered educational institutions,” which are defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a) institutions of higher education eligible for assistance under Title III or V of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.); or</li>
  <li>b) accredited post-secondary minority institutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eligible applicants include community colleges or other 2-year degree granting institutions meeting the definition of a “covered educational institution.” Enrollments, accreditation, and other factors may affect an institution’s eligibility in any given year. With the exception of HBCUs and Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), in order to meet the eligibility criterion above, an institution must apply to the Department of Education (DoEd) each year for Title III or Title V eligibility. A copy of the DoEd letter dated February 2020 or later certifying eligibility for Title III or Title V assistance must be included with each application submitted under this announcement.  The eligibility letter will not be included in the page limit detailed in Section IV below. If the DoEd eligibility letter is not submitted with the xTechHBCU submission, the applicant will be deemed ineligible and their submission will not be considered.</p>

<p>In addition to the “covered educational institution” requirement defined above, each submitting institution must (1) be a U.S.-based institution and (2) not be a U.S. Federal government entity or employ a U.S. Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment.</p>
