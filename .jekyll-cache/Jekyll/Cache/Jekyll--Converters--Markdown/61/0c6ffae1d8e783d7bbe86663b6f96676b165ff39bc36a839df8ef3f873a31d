<p><strong>Judging Panel</strong></p>

<p>After the Challenge submission deadline, submissions will be judged by a panel convened by the Seeker. The panel will recommend winning solutions to the Seeker, and the Seeker will make final selections. All persons or entities that submit a proposal will receive a high-level evaluation and be notified as to the status of their submission. Decisions by the Seeker cannot be contested.</p>

<p><strong>Judging Criteria</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The system must measure the activation of one or more toxic pathways that are linked to adverse health outcomes caused by environmental pollutants in water, such as hepatic toxicants, endocrine disrupting compounds, pesticides, heavy metals, and/or other contaminants of health concern.</li>
  <li>If multiple toxicity pathways are targeted, the system should provide information as to which pathway is activated to produce a signal.</li>
  <li>The system should function in a range of chemical concentrations of relevance to human health. It should also define, if available, lower and upper limits of response and quantification for positive controls for each pathway (i.e., the linear dynamic range (LDR)).</li>
  <li>The system should be functional under conditions normally associated with various water types (e.g., varying levels of microorganisms, pH, alkalinity, hardness, humic and fulvic acids, dissolved solids, turbidity, etc.), and account for associated matrix effects on sensor response. That is, the design should be compatible with operation and deployment of the sensor in field operations as opposed to a clinical setting.</li>
  <li>The system should be designed in such a way that the eventual final product would incorporate internal (possibly automated) quality assurance protocols (e.g. calibration) and define precision and accuracy for signals reported by the sensor.</li>
  <li>All sample handling/preparation requirements should be minimal and/or accounted for in the sensor design (i.e., automated).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>The following are not required for an award but would be “nice to have”:</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Demonstrated performance in a controlled (i.e., laboratory) setting for detection of various contaminants via perturbations of pathway(s).</li>
  <li>Provide continuous measurements to remote observers in real time.</li>
  <li>Extended deployment (weeks to months), with little-to-no maintenance required during deployment, prior to performance declining to below specified tolerance limits.</li>
  <li>Automatic self-detection of degradation of performance with alerts to the operator of this condition.</li>
</ul>
