<p>Submissions that are responsive and comply with the entry requirements will be reviewed by a panel of judges consisting of Federal employees. The responsive and compliant submission entries will be scored in accordance with the judging criteria outlined above. Scores from each criterion will be weighted equally, but failure to meet a minimum standard for any one criterion might disqualify a submission. The score for each submission will be the sum of the scores from each of the voting judges. The scores will be listed in order, from highest to lowest. Participants with sufficiently high scores will then be contacted for ‚Äúlive‚Äù meetings via the tele- or video-conference. Those meetings will be used to gather more details about the information provided in the Submission Package and to determine the up-to-date level of participant availability, interest and commitment. Final prize recommendations will be determined based on the judges‚Äô scoring and tele- or video-conference meetings.</p>
