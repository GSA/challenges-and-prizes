<h4 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h4>

<p>The Challenge is open to individuals and teams (Participants) from the academic, research, and business communities including, but not limited to, universities, research institutions, technology companies, and entrepreneurs. DOT expects teams to describe how they have engaged with stakeholders to understand the needs and constraints of both industry and travelers with disabilities as part of explaining the feasibility and impact of their design. Teams are strongly encouraged to identify representatives from both industry and the disability community to serve as advisors and/or team members and help inform the direction of their idea based on their knowledge and expertise. Strong proposals will be well-informed by a rich understanding of user needs and industry conditions.</p>

<h4 id="notes-on-terminology">Notes on Terminology</h4>

<ol>
  <li>This Challenge focuses specifically on vehicles operated exclusively by a Level 4 and 5 ADS, a level of automation at which human occupants are not expected to serve as a fallback, as long as the vehicle remains within the system’s operational design domain. In its standard J3016 Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems, SAE International refers to such vehicles as ADS-dedicated vehicles or ADS-DVs. DOT recognizes that some solutions proposed through this Challenge may also be applicable to dual-mode vehicles - capable of both driverless operation and operation by a conventional driver for a complete trip.</li>
  <li>In the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-14]), Congress reallocated $100 million for “. . . a highly automated vehicle (HAV) research and development program,” a portion of which is being used to fund this Challenge. The accompanying Explanatory Statement further clarified: “Of the total amount provided, not less than $38,000,000 shall be used for direct research, including administrative expenses, on HAV and [Advanced Driver Assistance System] technologies by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the Federal Transit Administration, of which no more than $5,000,000 shall be for ADAS research. For the purposes of the agreement, HAV refers to technologies capable of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) DOT Level 3, Level 4, or Level 5 automation, whereas ADAS refers to technologies capable of Level 1 or Level 2” (Division L, Title 1). DOT previously used the term HAV to refer to vehicles with Level 3-5 driving automation, but subsequently adopted the terminology in SAE J3016 Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems.</li>
