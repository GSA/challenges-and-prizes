<p>Phase 3 builds upon the work of Phase 2. Part of the scoring criteria for Phase 3 evaluates whether the approach was successfully tested at a small scale/community level to demonstrate acceptability, usefulness and feasibility. Participants will have equal access to SMEs for group and individual coaching throughout the phase. Each participant will have one consultation session with an SME. The seven semi-finalists will come together as a small community of practice in Phase 3.  Using digital tools (e.g., video conferencing, digital whiteboards), HHS will facilitate knowledge sharing among the group.  Over a two-session series, HHS will provide training to increase skills in how to assess and document successes and lessons learned while implementing and testing the approach. Participants are expected to successfully implement, test and disseminate the approach: (1) within the target population in their community; (2) in another sub-group in their community; (3) by increasing the size and/or reach of the approach. The winners are expected to present their project findings and participate in post-award activities within six months after the end of the competition.</p>

<p>The Phase 3 submission shall include a comprehensive written description (5 pages or less) and a supplemental video (30 minutes or less) of the approach testing process and results. The video will be a supplement to the written submission and may be utilized to highlight uniqueness and innovation of the approach.</p>

<p>The submission shall include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A description of the effectiveness of the approach in reducing stigma related to HIV/AIDS using community engagement/mobilization strategies in racial and ethnic minority groups; specific subgroups within those populations, and other interested stakeholders as identified.</li>
