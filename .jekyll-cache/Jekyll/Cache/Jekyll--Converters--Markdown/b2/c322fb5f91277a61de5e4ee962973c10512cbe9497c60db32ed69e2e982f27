I"M<p>NASA and Houston Cinema Arts Society (HCAS) will offer filmmakers around the world a chance to share their works inspired by – and using – actual NASA imagery through “CineSpace,” a new short film competition premiering at the Houston Cinema Arts Festival in November 2015.  Films featuring NASA-captured imagery and video collected throughout the agency’s 50-year history will be judged on creativity, innovation and attention to detail – the same hallmarks of spaceflight. Works submitted to CineSpace will compete for cash prizes and the opportunity to be shown to audiences both on and off Earth.  The competition is open to all filmmakers, both professional and aspiring. Submissions of all genres, up to 15 minutes running time, will be accepted. Entries must use at least 10 percent publically available NASA imagery.</p>
