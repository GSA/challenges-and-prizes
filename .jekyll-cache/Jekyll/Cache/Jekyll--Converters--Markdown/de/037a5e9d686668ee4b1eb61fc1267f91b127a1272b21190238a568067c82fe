As a Clean Energy Ministerial initiative, Global LEAP seeks to advance global clean energy access policy goals by harnessing the power of marketplace competition to drive technical and market innovations in the off-grid appliance sector. The inaugural Global LEAP Awards were announced in May 2014 at the 5th Clean Energy Ministerial in Seoul, Korea, and featured off-grid LED luminaires and televisions. The second Global LEAP Awards were announced in June 2016 at the 7th Clean Energy Ministerial in San Francisco, USA, and featured off-grid televisions and fans.    Â     This Global LEAP Awards Competition will focus on super-efficient off-grid refrigerators, and will recognize commercially-available products that demonstrate a strong balance of energy efficiency, quality, affordability, and off-grid appropriateness. The Innovation Prize, a component of the Competition, consists of a cash reward that will be awarded to up to three (3) commercially-available OR late-stage prototype products that demonstrate market-leading technical and/or design innovation.    Â     The Collaborative Labeling and Appliance Standards Program (â€œCLASPâ€) serves as the â€œAwards Operating Agentâ€ and â€œAdministratorâ€ for the Global LEAP Awards. The Global LEAP Awards Off-Grid Refrigerator Competition is supported by USAIDâ€™s Global Development Lab as part of the Scaling Off-Grid Energy: A Grand Challenge for Development initiative, the U.K. Department for International Developmentâ€™s Ideas to Impact Programme, Power Africaâ€™s Beyond the Grid initiative, and the U.S. Department of Energy.

Winners of the Competition (â€œCompetition Winnersâ€) will be identified in the following way by the Administrator awarding up to 80 points based on a formulaic assessment of â€œtotal cost of ownershipâ€ (which is based on Laboratory Testing results of power consumption and standardized Global LEAP Awards assumptions about retail price, $/kWh, Product lifetime, and usage) and performance (which is based upon the productsâ€™ (i) time to cool a standardized load to a steady state and (ii) time holding a band of acceptable temperature once power has been disconnected).&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  Â     The formulaic assessment shall be Total Cost of Ownership (Product energy consumption<em>standardized lifetime usage assumptions [kWh]</em>$/kWh) + (wholesale price*standardized retail price modifier)) <strong>x</strong> Time to Cool to Steady State Modifier (where less time is better) <strong>x</strong> Time Holding Acceptable Temperature Band Modifier (where more time is better) = $XXX. In this assessment, Preliminary Finalists with a lower total dollar figure will receive a higher score. This calculation will be used only for the purposes of judging the Global LEAP Awards, and its results will not be shared    Â     The remaining 20 points will be awarded based on the Expert Assessment of the Expert Panel. A Finalist may earn two (2) points of â€œextra creditâ€ for each year of its warranty beyond the required two years (see eligibility requirements), up to eight (8) total points. Nominators must provide a copy of the warranty in English. Finalists using exclusively natural refrigerants will receive three (3) points of â€œextra creditâ€.    Â     The Product in each Category that earns the most points will be declared the â€œWinnerâ€ of its Category, and all other high-performing Products will be declared â€œFinalists.â€ The Administrator reserves the right to exclude from all Competition promotions any Preliminary Finalist that fails or performs poorly in the Laboratory Testing, Field Testing and/or Expert Assessment.
