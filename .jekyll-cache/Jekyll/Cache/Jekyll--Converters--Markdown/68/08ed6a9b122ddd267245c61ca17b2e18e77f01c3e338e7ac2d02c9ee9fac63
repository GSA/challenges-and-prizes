<p><strong>Description:</strong> Augmenting Mobile Data Sources for Public Health Surveillance The system was designed to simplify and improve the quality and quantity of health behavior data collection by aggregating personal wearable device and mobile health app data, augmented by user validation and supplemented with survey responses. The mobile app was designed to collect and validate data from wearable devices and mobile apps and to collect survey responses on healthy behaviors. The data collected include nutrition, sleep, physical activity and sedentary behaviors. The project included a series of short, just-in-time survey questions delivered via push notification to supplement mobile data sources. The system cross-validated the collected healthy behavior data from the mobile and survey data sets, as well as with the BRFSS survey data. Robert Furberg - RTI International - Enhancing Public Health Surveillance Indicators using Wearable Devices The method was designed to augment any mode of data collection, from interviewer-administered in-person or telephone surveys to self-administration online or via mobile device, with minimal disruption to these essential data collection activities. The project demonstrated how the combination of self-generated data can enhance public health surveillance indicators to provide valid, measures of physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and sleep. The approach implemented a three-step data collection:&nbsp; screening, survey, and data retrieval. Owners of Fitbit devices were invited to participate in the HBDC. A service called Fitabase was used for data retrieval of the three measures.</p>
