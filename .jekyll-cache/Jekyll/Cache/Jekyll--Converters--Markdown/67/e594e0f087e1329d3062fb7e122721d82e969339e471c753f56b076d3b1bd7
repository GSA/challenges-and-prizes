I"<p><strong>BOLDLINE: THE P3 ACCELERATOR</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State is proud to launch Boldline, an accelerator for public-private partnerships (P3s). One of the first programs of its kind, Boldline supports partnerships that address pressing global challenges and focuses on giving them tools to scale their missions. The main goal of Boldline is to build and deploy strategic connections and collaborations aimed at: a) strengthening the global partnership building ecosystem; b) promoting and facilitating connectivity between the private sector and governments; and c) fostering innovative partnership business models. Boldline seeks to take the often dotted lines (or gaps) between sectors and, by cultivating public-private partnerships, create a bold line between them.</p>
<p><strong>P3S + 1 WEEK</strong></p>
<p>New public-private partnership ideas and partnerships ready to scale their operations and activities take part in a one-week program. Boldline provides participants with access to resources, mentorship, and a global network. The first iteration of the accelerator took place in February 2018 in Washington, DC. The participating P3s were presented at the 2018 Global Partnerships Week forum on March 5th at the U.S. Institute of Peace.</p>
