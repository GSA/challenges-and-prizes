<h4 id="prize-breakdown">Prize Breakdown</h4>

<p>EPA may award a total prize award pool of $50,000. The minimum full award amount is $30,000. EPA may allocate higher individual award amounts, as deemed appropriate. The Challenge award will be contingent upon results of critical analysis and evaluation by EPA and its partners. Meeting the Technical Requirements does not guarantee that the proposed solution will receive an award from EPA. Partial cash prizes may be considered for solutions that meet some, but not all, of the criteria.</p>

<p>Winning Solver(s) may be invited to reduce their solution to practice. Solvers should make it clear if they have the interest and ability for subsequent development phases and would be willing to consider future collaborations and/or subsequent competitions with support of government staff and facilities.</p>
