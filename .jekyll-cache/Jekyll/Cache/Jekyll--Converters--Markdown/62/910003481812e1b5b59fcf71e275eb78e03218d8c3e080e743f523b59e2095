<p><strong>Judging Panel</strong></p>

<p>Feedback will be provided to all participants at the end of each part of this competition.  The purpose of providing feedback is to help the participants understand potential use cases or applications for the technology within the Army, suggestions for product improvement for Army use, and recommended next steps for development.  The United States Government (USG) will not respond to questions or inquiries regarding the provided feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Judging Criteria</strong></p>

<p><strong>Part 1: Research Concept</strong></p>

<p>All eligible faculty members are invited to submit one (1) or more proposed research or technology concept(s) applications to one (1) or more topic(s) of their choice. Concept submissions will be evaluated by a team of Army experts including scientific, technical, acquisition, and user experts.  Submissions will consist of a brief concept description that includes a 1-page concept white paper and an optional video no more than 3 minutes in length to further describe or demonstrate the concept.  Participants are not required to submit a professional video, videos can be taken on a cell phone or another device of your choice and will not be graded on production quality, but rather will provide an additional format to further explain your proposed research concept.</p>

<p>All submissions shall adhere to the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All concept white papers must be submitted using the template found on the Valid Eval registration page, “xTechHBCU_WhitePaper_Template.doc”.  <strong>Any proposals submitted in a format other than that provided by the template will not be reviewed, please read all instructions on the first page of the template document carefully.</strong></li>
  <li>Optionally, participants may submit an accompanying Video to further describe the concept to the Army evaluators.  All videos shall be submitted <strong>using a Vimeo link</strong> with no password protection to ensure that all evaluators will have access. Concept Videos do not require professionals to develop, the videos can be taken from a phone, camera or any equipment that is already readily available to faculty members.</li>
  <li>Please list your name(s) and proposal title <strong>EXACTLY</strong> how you would like them to appear on any contest marketing materials. Use clear and concise proposal titles to give readers and potential stakeholders an understanding of how your research or technology concept would benefit the Army.</li>
</ul>

<p>Research Concepts applications will be evaluated and ranked using the following Scoring Criteria (further details on each scoring dimension can be found on the xTechHBCU registration page):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introduction – 5%</li>
  <li>Alignment and Degree of Innovation – 30%</li>
  <li>Technology and Concept Viability – 30%</li>
  <li>Team – 25%</li>
  <li>Narrative Quality – 10%</li>
  <li>Potential for Army Impact – 0% (this is graded as a means to provide Army feedback only, but will not impact proposal evaluation scores at this stage)</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon competition of Part 1, the top-rated research concepts, up to a maximum of 54, will receive a prize of $5,000, and be invited to submit a more detailed draft proposal in Part 2.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2: Draft Proposal</strong></p>

<p>All selected participants from Part 1 will be invited to submit a 3-page draft proposal and an optional video no more than 5 minutes in length to further describe or demonstrate the concept. The xTechHBCU program will provide optional virtual programming to all applicants during this part of the competition to help align their research proposals with Army problems and provide insight and guidance to faculty members as they develop a draft proposal for award. Detailed instructions and evaluation criteria for draft proposals will be provided to Part 2 participants.</p>

<p>Although evaluation criteria and associated weights may vary across xTechHBCU phases, the evaluation criteria across all phases is derived from the originating ARO Open Broad Agency Announcement (<a href="https://www.arl.army.mil/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AROBAA_W911NF17S0002-Amendment-9.pdf">BAA</a>) and, in general and not limited to, will touch on the following factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Scientific or technical merit</em> – the overall scientific and technical merit, creativity, and innovation of the concept submission.</li>
  <li><em>Potential for Army Impact</em> – the potential impact on the US military (e.g., specific application areas and/or specific platforms or users of relevance).</li>
  <li><em>Team qualifications</em> – qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed PI, team leader, or other key personnel who are critical to achievement of the proposed objectives; and the applicants record of past performance.</li>
  <li><em>Proposal Quality</em> – quality of the narrative, arguments, and data attribution to support arguments with relevant, properly attributed data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon conclusion of the judging for Part 2, the Army will select up to twelve (12) winners to receive a prize of $15,000 and an invitation to the Finals.</p>

<p><strong>Part 3: Final Proposal</strong></p>

<p>Selected participants from Part 2 will be invited to conduct an in-person or virtual 15-minute presentation followed by a 15-minute Q&amp;A session with a panel of Army experts.  Selected participants from Part 2 will also have an opportunity to participate in more intensive optional virtual and/or in-person programming to engage directly with Program Managers (PMs) and SMEs associated with topics outlined in this announcement, work directly with key Army stakeholders, further align their research proposals with Army problems, and gain additional insight and guidance on how to develop a final proposal for award consideration. As with Part 2 above, detailed instructions, evaluation criteria for final proposals will be provided to Part 3 participants and will follow from the ARO <a href="https://www.arl.army.mil/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AROBAA_W911NF17S0002-Amendment-9.pdf">BAA</a>.  The primary evaluation criteria for the final proposal will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scientific or technical merit – the overall scientific and technical merit, creativity, and innovation of the concept submission.</li>
  <li>Potential for Army Impact – the potential impact on the US military (e.g., specific application areas and/or specific platforms or users of relevance).</li>
  <li>Team qualifications – qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed PI, team leader, or other key personnel who are critical to achievement of the proposed objectives; and the applicants record of past performance.</li>
  <li>Presentation Quality – quality of the oral delivery, arguments, and data attribution to support arguments with relevant, properly attributed data, visual design and command of the question and answer session.</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon conclusion of the Finals, up to three (3) participants selected will receive $25,000 in prize money and be invited to submit their final proposals and may be awarded a cooperative agreement (or similar) for up to 1-year and up to $150,000.</p>

<p><strong>Follow-on Research Opportunity Awards</strong></p>

<p>Only the participants that are selected from Part 3 will be eligible to submit their final proposal for follow-on research opportunity awards. Finalists invited to submit their final proposal will be notified and receive detailed instructions upon selection. A separate announcement will be issued with detailed instructions on how to submit the final proposal for the cooperative agreement (or similar) award for up to 1-year and up to $150,000 through the ARO <a href="https://www.arl.army.mil/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AROBAA_W911NF17S0002-Amendment-9.pdf">BAA</a>. Finalists invited to submit their final proposal will be notified and will receive detailed instructions aligned with the associated <a href="https://www.arl.army.mil/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AROBAA_W911NF17S0002-Amendment-9.pdf">BAA</a> and <a href="http://www.grants.gov">www.grants.gov</a> for final submission. All applicants are encouraged to review the BAA to learn more about the submission requirements for potential follow-on awards and for other opportunities with ARO.</p>
