I"s<p><strong>HHS Announces Health Data Provenance Challenge Winners</strong>         The Department of Health and Humans Services Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) today announced the Phase 2 winners of the “Oh the Places Data Goes: Health Data Provenance” Challenge.    The winning solutions were submitted by 1upHealth and RAIN Live Oak Technology.  1upHealth piloted the use of its partner’s provider application to surface provenance information and help providers find aggregated data from various sources using Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) along with proposed improvements afforded by smart contracts on the blockchain’s public ledger.    RAIN Live Oak created a software toolkit enabling health information systems of any size to integrate provenance into their data-flow without disrupting existing practices or data repository requirements.    Provenance of data is important in making sure that the person or entity that receives the information can be confident in the authenticity, trustworthiness, and reliability of the data – and the organization or person that originally sent the data electronically is just as trustworthy. The winners of Phase 2 of the challenge submitted a recorded demonstration, solution guide, and lessons learned focused on prototyping and testing the effectiveness of their solution.    The need for health data provenance, and standard approaches to capture it, is an important priority across the health information technology system. It is complex and plays a role in almost everything related to the use and exchange of electronic data. The winning submissions demonstrated some innovative and standardized solutions that could lead to improvements in the provenance of health data will help the healthcare industry better maximize health data that is already digitized and ready to share.</p>
