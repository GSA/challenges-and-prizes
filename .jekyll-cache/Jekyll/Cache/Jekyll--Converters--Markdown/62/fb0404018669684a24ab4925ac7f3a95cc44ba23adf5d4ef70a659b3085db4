I"q<p><strong>NIAAA Selects Winnners of Its Wearable Alcohol Biosensor Challenge  </strong></p>
<p>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism announced the winners of its Wearable Alcohol Biosensor Challenge on May 19, 2016.The competition sought the design of a discreet device capable of measuring blood alcohol levels in near real-time.</p>
<p>The winning prototype and recipient of the $200,000 first prize was submitted by BACtrack, a company known nationally for designing and selling portable breath alcohol testers for consumer and professional use. Their entry, the BACtrack Skyn, is worn on the wrist and offers continuous and non-invasive monitoring of a user’s BAC. Alcohol is detected using a fuel cell technology similar to that in devices used by law enforcement for roadside alcohol testing. The device connects via Bluetooth to a smartphone to store data.</p>
<p>“NIAAA issued this challenge to spark innovation in alcohol biosensor development. We were very pleased at the level of response and quality of prototypes that we received from the biotech community,” said NIAAA Director George Koob, PhD.</p>

<p>The Wearable Alcohol Biosensor Challenge, issued through Challenge.gov in March 2015, called for non-invasive wearable technology that could improve upon existing alcohol biosensor technology used in the criminal justice system. An improved alcohol biosensor could be a valuable resource for the alcohol research community, decreasing reliance on participant self-report in scientific studies.</p>
<p>Background:    Current technologies for real-time monitoring of alcohol consumption, used in criminal justice applications, have performed adequately, but have disadvantages for broader use. Current technology for continuous alcohol monitoring takes a reading every 30 minutes.</p>
<p>NIAAA sought a solution that improves on this interval and most closely approximates real-time monitoring and data collection.  The desired device would quantitate blood alcohol level, interpret and store the data, or transmit it to a smartphone or other device by wireless transmission.  Data storage and transmission would be completely secure in order to protect the privacy of the individual.  The device would have the ability to verify standardization at regular intervals and to indicate loss of functionality.  The power source would be dependable and rechargeable.  A form of subject identification would be an added benefit.  The device would be removable.</p>
<p>The challenge required written documentation and a working prototype of the submitted solution. NIAAA previously stipulated it was open to a range of design forms which can accomplish the above tasks.</p>
