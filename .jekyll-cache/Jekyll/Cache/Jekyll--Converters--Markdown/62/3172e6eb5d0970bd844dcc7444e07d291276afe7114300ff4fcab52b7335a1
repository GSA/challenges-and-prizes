I"§<p>Intelligence analysts, policy makers, and first responders around the world rely on geospatial land use data to inform crucial decisions about global defense and humanitarian activities. Historically, analysts have manually identified and classified geospatial information by comparing and analyzing satellite images, but that process is time consuming and insufficient to support disaster response.    TheÂ <i>Functional Map of the World (fMoW) Challenge</i>Â seeks to foster breakthroughs in the automated analysis of overhead imagery by harnessing the collective power of the global data science and machine learning communities. The challenge will publish one of the largest publicly available satellite-image datasets to date, with more than one million points of interest from around the world. The dataset contains satellite-specific metadata that researchers can exploit to build a competitive algorithm that classifies facility, building, and land use.  &lt;h6&gt;Be Part of the Innovation&lt;/h6&gt;  IARPA is conducting this Challenge to invite the broader research community of industry and academia, with or without experience in deep learning and computer vision analysis, to participate in a convenient, efficient and non-contractual way. Participants will develop algorithms that scan satellite data to identify functions based on multiple reference sources, such as overhead and ground-based images, digital elevation data, existing well-understood image collections, surface geology, geography, and cultural information. The goals and objectives of this Challenge are to:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Promote and benchmark deep learning applications for geospatial data&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Stimulate various communities to develop and enhance automation for image/video geolocation data&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Cultivate and sustain an ongoing collaborative community dedicated to this technology and research&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;</p>
