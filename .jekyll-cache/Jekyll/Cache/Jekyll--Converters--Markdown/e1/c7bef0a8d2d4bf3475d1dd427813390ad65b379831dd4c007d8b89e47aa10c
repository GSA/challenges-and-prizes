I"‘<p>This is a Theoretical Challenge that requires only a written proposed solution that describes novel technologies or improvements to existing technologies, which meet the needs of the Solution Requirements above. The submitted proposal must be written in English and no longer than 10 pages (with at least 11-point font and 1-inch margins; page count excludes references and graphics), and must contain the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An executive summary (~1/2 page) of the proposed solution and general information on the proposed technology.</li>
  <li>A detailed description of the proposed solution/technology, including adaptability of the technology to a sensor platform and/or improvements to current technologies. Include data, if available, for and descriptions of how the technology might work with different water types. If designed for a specific water type(s), identify the water type(s). Also identify which toxicity pathways are detected. It should be clear which likely scenarios the system is designed to detect.</li>
  <li>Rationale as to why the Solver believes that the proposed system will work. This rationale should address each of the <strong>Solution Requirements</strong> identified in the Detailed Description and be supported with any relevant examples and/or data, if available.</li>
  <li>Results from laboratory or field deployments of prototype sensor, if available.</li>
  <li>Pictures or drawings of the proposed solution, if available.</li>
  <li>Description of resources, expertise, materials, budget, and proposed timeframe needed to develop a prototype.</li>
  <li>Provide detailed requirements for sensor operation and the engineering solution(s) for sensor and consumable maintenance, shelf-life of consumables, skills/knowledge required for sensor operation, user-training packages, and anticipated field service intervals.  Provide a life-cycle cost analysis.</li>
  <li>Provide estimated data on logistical requirements such as: size, weight, resource requirements (i.e., electricity, reagents), and sampling resolution (temporal/spatial).</li>
</ol>

<p>The proposal <strong>should not</strong> include any personal identifying information (e.g., name, username, company, address, phone, email, personal website, resume, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility Requirements</strong></p>

<p>If awarded, Winning Solvers must certify they do not have identical or essentially equivalent work currently funded by a United States Federal agency.</p>

<p>Federal employees acting within the scope of their employment are not eligible to participate. A Federal employee acting outside the scope of his or her employment should consult his or her ethics official before participating in the Challenge.</p>

<p>The potential award for this Challenge is $15,000 for a proposal that meets all requirements. The Seeker intends to award up to three prizes. Solvers are not required to give up any of their intellectual property (‚ÄúIP‚Äù) rights to the Seeker to be eligible to receive an award.</p>
