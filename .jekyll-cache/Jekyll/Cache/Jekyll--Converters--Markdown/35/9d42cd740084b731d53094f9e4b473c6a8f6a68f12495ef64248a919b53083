I"©<p>Calling all Starfleet cadets!    &lt;p&gt;Star Trek, ASME and NASA want you to pioneer the future of food in space. Your challenge is to create a digital model of a food-related item for astronauts to 3-D print in the year 2050. We want designs that boldy go where no human has 3-D printed before and designs that help astronauts eat nutritious meals so they can live long and prosper.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;You must specify one of the following locations for your 3-D print: our moon, another planet, another planetâ€™s moon, or a spacecraft beyond low earth orbit (explain where it is going and why). You must also specify the intended printing material (feedstock) for your 3-D print. This could be plastic, metal, recycled materials, locally sourced material, or any non-edible, 3-D printing feedstock you think would advance human space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Eating a meal in space goes beyond the actual food itself - from growing food to devouring it. There are many things to consider, so check out our <u>rules</u>, <u>design guidelines</u>, and <u>education resources</u> prior to starting your design.    Student winners will receive a range of prizes, including a trip to New York for a tour of the Space Shuttle Enterprise at the Intrepid Museum with an astronaut, a 3-D printer for the winnersâ€™ schools or aÂ <em>Star Trek</em>Â prize pack.    We hope youâ€™re hungry for space innovationâ€¦ Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;</p>
