<p>Submissions should:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Identify/Introduce a Neuroethics Topic</strong> – Any aspect of neuroscience that can be tied to ethical, legal, or societal implications in 2020 will be considered responsive.</li>
  <li><strong>Express a Point of View</strong> – Neuroethics discussions draw on facts, such as scientific findings or laws, and also personal experiences and belief systems. Make sure to include - and explain - YOUR point of view from both evidence-based and personal perspectives when presenting your idea. Be sure to properly cite any published work you reference.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Original Thinking and Creativity</strong> – Countless experts have puzzled over neuroethics topics already, but this gives you a great starting point! Whatever you propose should be YOUR own idea. If you’re incorporating work from others, make sure to cite them appropriately! Remember to think outside the box! We’re looking for creative approaches across the board – in your concept or idea, as well as how you present it!</li>
  <li><strong>Have Strength of Writing or Media Production</strong> – When writing, double check your spelling, grammar, sentence structure, and paragraph composition. Don’t forget the importance of introductions, conclusions, and topic sentences! When producing a video, remember to provide a clear storyline or message and be creative, using visual metaphors, music and/or graphical elements to highlight key points. Don’t forget the importance of lighting, transitions and good sound quality!</li>
