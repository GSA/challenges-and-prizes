School meal applications have slowed to a trickle and your office is switching gears to draw your verification sample. You have high hopes that the plan you spent so much time refining over the summer will increase your household response rate:&nbsp; a re-designed verification selection notice, text message reminders, and that brilliant idea that Wanda came up with! Surely one of those will make a difference...  You would feel just a little more confident if you knew that another school district had success with a similar strategy.</em></p> <hr /> <p><strong>Background</strong></p> <p>School districts approved almost five million household applications for free or reduced price school meal benefits last year. Nearly nine million children from low income families were named on those applications. You know how vital the school meal programs are to the families in your district. But you also recognize the importance of the annual verification process.</p> <p>Many school districts struggle with low verification response rates. Despite their best efforts some districts get barely half of their households to respond. For other districts a 50 percent response rate would be a big improvement.</p> <p>But just as many districts have identified low-cost and creative strategies, often through trial and error, that allow them to consistently exceed 70, 80, or 90 percent response rates. In some cases those strategies are tailored to unique local circumstances and may not be practical anywhere else. But other strategies are more universal ‚Äì sometimes a great idea is just a great idea.</p>    <hr /> <p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p> <p>The ‚ÄúVerification Response Rate Challenge‚Äù is a public forum for school district officials to exchange ideas on how to increase household response in the annual verification process. District staff can share their own verification success stories or they can build on others‚Äô submissions with constructive feedback and suggestions. Either way, the goal is to encourage dialog, refine ideas, and put great strategies to work.</p> <p>Your contribution may help other school districts increase their verification response rates, reduce the time and expense associated with repeat follow-up reminders to households, and reduce the risk that eligible children lose access to program benefits.</p> <p>The challenge is structured as a contest to maximize engagement and help uncover the most effective solutions. A panel of distinguished judges will review participant submissions on criteria that include proven success, cost effectiveness, practicality, and creativity. USDA will feature submissions recognized in several categories at this summer‚Äôs School Nutrition Association Annual National Conference in Atlanta. </p> </div>
