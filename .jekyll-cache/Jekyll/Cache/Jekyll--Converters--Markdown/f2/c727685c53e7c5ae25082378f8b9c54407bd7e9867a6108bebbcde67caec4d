I"W<p>Air Force Space Education is currently conducted via a multi-phase training program, consisting of lessons in spacelift considerations, orbital mechanics, operational implications of orbit type and satellite constellation design, and strategic impact in the application of multiple satellite systems and constellations in support of regional commanders.</p>
<p>We are looking for your concept for a mobile-friendly application, and we are employing a competitive process which provides Air Force personnel a way to collaborate with the software development community to develop and refine prototype solutions for the space operational visualization tool. The ultimate goal of this process is to award contracts to develop and deploy a working prototype for the new mobile Spacecraft Engagement Simulation Experiment application for use by all Air Force Airmen.</p>
<p><strong>Posting a Solution</strong></p>
<p>Solutions can be submitted between the start and end dates published below. Late solutions will not be allowed and only solutions submitted on the challenge submission site are eligible for USAF funding via this process. Submissions are visible or &ldquo;open&rdquo; to any registered user of the submission platform. No intellectual property (IP), confidential, or proprietary information is made public unless posted in a public field on the submission form by the solution submitter. However, submissions posted via a desktop browser may attach files/documents which will only be visible to USAF reviewers.</p>

<div>Solutions Phase End:&nbsp; 01/04/2019 @ 11:59 PM CST</div>
<p><strong>USAF Review, Selection, and Invitation</strong></p>
<p>During this phase, USAF experts will review solution proposals. The top solutions meeting the needs and requirements of the selection team will be invited to participate in a design and prototype phase beginning in early 2019.</p>
<div>Selection Phase Start:&nbsp; 01/05/2019</div>
<div>Selection Phase End:&nbsp; 01/11/2019</div>
<p><strong>Design Sprint</strong></p>
<p>During this phase, invited solution providers will participate in a design workshop to refine the specifications, and will receive compensation for their efforts.&nbsp; Competitors will have the opportunity for refine their design, based on revised specifications, and at the end of this phase, pitch their updated design.&nbsp; At the end of this Design Phase, USAF experts will review updated designs and select a single provider to develop the prototype.</p>
<div>Design Phase Start:&nbsp; 01/14/2019</div>
<div>Design Phase End:&nbsp; 02/01/2019</div>
<p><strong>Prototype Generation Phase</strong></p>
<p>During this phase, the selected vendor will be compensated to create the prototype of the mobile application, with up to two &ldquo;missions&rdquo; included at each &ldquo;layer&rdquo; of the game.&nbsp; This phase includes seven weeks for Engineering and Build, and will be followed by several weeks of beta testing to evaluate the efficacy of the product design.</p>
