<p>Judges will be a panel of STEM researchers, educators, and other professionals at NSF, the NSF awardee community, and the broader public. They will evaluate, score, and rank submissions to determine winner(s) in the Informal STEM Education, PreK-12 STEM Education, STEM Higher Education, and STEM Alliances entry categories. Entries will be evaluated based on: Approach, Impact, and Sustainability; Visual Appeal; Effective Communication; and Originality. NSF will make final determinations and award all prize winners.</p>

<p>The judging panel will use a 100-point scale to evaluate the videos. The scale will rank the extent to which the video can demonstrate the following:</p>

<p><strong><em>Approach, Impact and Sustainability (40pts)</em></strong></p>

<p>A successful entry must display an executed concept that has encouraged and supported diversifying and developing a competent U.S. STEM workforce of scientists, technicians, engineers, mathematicians and educators through partnerships. A successful entry should clearly define the approach taken to the work. Impact can be measured in the number of people reached, policies developed, programs created, and partnerships forged. In the case of social media, the following numbers should be indicated: views, readers, citations, subscribers, retweets or shares, and public responses. An entry should demonstrate how the effort(s) could or have been sustained within your organization and disseminated to the wider STEM community.</p>

<p><strong><em>Visual Appeal (15pts)</em></strong></p>

<p>A successful entry provides viewers with a visually striking, unique, clean, and creative technical approach to video production. The video must have a high level of audibility and visual quality. The entry must be polished and professional and must be executed with factual accuracy.</p>

<p><strong><em>Effective Communication (25pts)</em></strong></p>

<p>A successful entry communicates in a clear and understandable manner. It uses plain language, both written and spoken. The written entry description and caption must be presented at a level and using language that can be understood by the general public, which includes a broad audience of varying ages and backgrounds. Use of technical terminology and assumption of prior knowledge of STEM concepts in the video should be limited.</p>

<p><strong><em>Originality (20pts)</em></strong></p>

<p>A successful entry creates a novel presentation or tells a compelling story and portrays new insight and approaches to broadening diversity in STEM.</p>
