I"7 <p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is holding a coast-to-coast hackathon on Wednesday, June 19, 2019, aimed at bettering the customer experience of products in government.</p>
<p>Throughout the federal government, as described in the <a href="https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President&rsquo;s Management Agenda</a>, improving customer experience is a top priority. Customer experience can refer to the external customers and internal customers. This hackathon, we will be focusing on both. The participants will be including the newly-released <a href="https://digital.gov/2019/04/08/introducing-uswds-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Web Design System 2.0</a> in their solutions.</p>
<p>Throughout this all-day hackathon, taking place simultaneously at eight GSA locations nationwide, participants will evaluate real-world products and iterate on ideas for making the customer experience better in GSA applications.</p>
