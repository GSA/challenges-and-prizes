<p>The Million HeartsÂ® Hypertension Control Challenge is a competition to identify clinicians, practices, and health systems that have demonstrated exceptional achievements in working with their patients to control hypertension.Â This year, we will be recognizing those who achieved 80% blood pressure control (blood pressure reading &lt;140 mmHg/&lt;90 mmHg) among their hypertensive population aged 18-85 years.</p>

<p>The Challenge is open to public and private clinicians, medical practices, and health systems located in the United States. Strategies used by Champions that support hypertension control may be written into a success story and posted on the Million HeartsÂ® website at <a href="https://millionhearts.hhs.gov/">https://millionhearts.hhs.gov/</a>.</p>
