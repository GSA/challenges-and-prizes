<div class="description"> <p>Full ocean depths (nominally 6000m) and long-term exposure to seawater create great challenges in the undersea environment. These challenges restrict the design and capability of weapons, electronics and vehicles both manned and unmanned.</p> <p>The goal of this prize challenge is to seek solutions or technology to:</p> <p>Design and construct a body/payload section that will survive full ocean depth pressures (6000m/10,000psi). The body/section shall be cylindrical with at least one removable/reusable end cap, approximately 21” in length, nominal outer diameter of 5.125” with maximized payload volume, and shall be scalable to diameters from 4” to 60”.</p> </div>
