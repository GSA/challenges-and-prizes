<p>The judging panel, comprised of Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) scientists, will assess each submission‚Äôs creativity in depicting the patient journey map, generalizability of the journey to other patients struggling with a similar SUD, and clarity of the journey phases. The judges will consider the 4 following criteria and make recommendations to the award approving official based upon their assessments of the criteria. Each criterion will be scored with a maximum of 10 points.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Use of patient journey mapping elements (0-10 points)</strong>. How well does the submission describe identification, selection, and characterization of the multiple patient journey phases and description of major touch points? To what extent does the submitted map identify, characterize, and capture the relevant symptoms, thoughts and emotions experienced by SUD patients along the journey? How well does the map illustrate the drivers and barriers for each segment of the journey? Does the map identify the ‚Äúmoments of truth‚Äù (gaps between the desired and the real experience)?</li>
  <li><strong>Creativity and originality (0-10 points)</strong>. Does the submitted map convey a concise, visually compelling story of the SUD patient‚Äôs experience? Does the submission show quality composition, creativity, and aesthetics?</li>
  <li><strong>Applicability to broad patient population (0-10 points)</strong>. Would others with a similar SUD make connections from this map to their own experiences? How well could the map reflect other patients‚Äô journeys? Would the journey be applicable to patients of many different backgrounds (e.g., different genders, socioeconomic statuses, races/ethnicities, income levels)? How well does the patient journey map represent common emotions patients feel during their journey?</li>
  <li><strong>Clarity (0-10 points)</strong>. Are the journey map and narrative clear and well-articulated? Are the labels for each step in the journey clear and concise? Is the journey presented in a straightforward manner? Is the patient journey map visually simple? Does it look like a map?</li>
