<p>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) helps power and secure America‚Äôs future and ensure the country‚Äôs role as a leader in science and technology. In 2015, the Secretary of Energy authorized the formation of the Office of Technology Transitions (OTT) to be responsible for developing and overseeing delivery of DOE‚Äôs strategic vision and goals for technology commercialization and engagement with the business and industrial sectors across the United States. OTT‚Äôs mission is to expand the commercial impact and public benefit of DOE‚Äôs research and development portfolio to advance the economic, energy, and national security interests of the Nation.¬†</p>

<p>Energy startups and innovative technologies are critical to the growth of the energy economy in the United States and abroad. Startups drive technology development, business model innovation, and job creation. The private sector has had difficulty providing sufficient capital, business development services, and entrepreneurial training to early-stage, high-risk, longer-term, capital-intensive technologies, like those required for transforming the nation‚Äôs energy systems.¬†</p>

<p>Strong business incubation services‚Äîincluding, but not limited to, mentoring, entrepreneurial training, access to testing and prototyping assistance‚Äînot only provide direct support for early-stage startups, but also have the potential to de-risk the startups for follow-on investors. Incubators have the potential to accelerate regional economic development, strengthen national innovation capacity, and expand domestic energy-related manufacturing. By providing due diligence, screening applicant companies, assisting with prototyping, connecting entrepreneurs with manufacturers, and advising startups to prudently use their capital on vital services, incubators play a critical role in supporting startups as they transition into the market.</p>

<p>The EPIC prize seeks to recognize the most novel, comprehensive, and impactful incubator plans that focus on developing strong innovation clusters, connections, and support for energy-related technology and entrepreneurial innovation. Prize competitors will develop a strategic plan to create or bolster innovation clusters through regional engagement, including engagement of other private actors‚Äîboth for- and non-profit‚Äîas well as state and local entities that can provide additional resources. 
The prize seeks to address a capital gap in supporting these critical organizations by providing funds to be applied where incubators need them most. Providing capital to enable creative, forward-thinking organizations is critical to allow organizations to think more expansively about the role of incubators in the broader regional and national innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem. Further, it is DOE‚Äôs hope that this funding will enable winners of this prize to enhance their organization‚Äôs resilience and operational sustainability.¬†</p>

<h4 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Private entities (for-profits and nonprofits), non-federal government entities such as states, counties, tribes, and municipalities, and academic institutions subject to the following requirements:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Private entities must be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States with majority domestic ownership and control. If an entity seeking to compete does not have domestic ownership and control, the DOE Office of Technology Transitions (OTT) may consider issuing a waiver of that eligibility requirement where the entity submits a compelling justification; the entity is incorporated in and maintains a primary place of business in the United States; and the entity otherwise meets the eligibility requirements. OTT may require additional information before making a determination on the waiver request. There are no rights to appeal DOE‚Äôs decision on the waiver request. See Appendix 2 of the rules document for more information on the waiver process.</li>
      <li>Academic Institutions must be based in the United States.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>DOE employees, employees of sponsoring organizations, members of their immediate families (i.e., spouses, children, siblings, or parents), and persons living in the same household as such persons, whether or not related, are not eligible to participate in the Prize.</li>
  <li>Federal entities and federal employees, acting within the scope of their employment, are also not eligible to participate in any portion of the Prize. DOE national laboratory employees cannot compete in the Prize.</li>
  <li>Entities and individuals publicly banned from doing business with the U.S. government such as entities and individuals debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participating in Federal programs are not eligible to compete.</li>
  <li>Entities identified on a Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Binding Operational Directives (BOD) as an entity publicly banned from doing business with the Unites States government are not eligible to compete. See https://cyber.dhs.gov/directives/</li>
  <li>Entities and individuals identified as a restricted party on one or more screening lists of Department of Commerce, State and the Treasury are not eligible to compete. See Consolidated Screening List https://2016.export.gov/ecr/eg_main_023148.asp</li>
  <li>This prize is expected to positively impact U.S. economic competitiveness. Participation in a foreign government talent recruitment program (for more information see full <a href="https://americanmadechallenges.org/epic/">rules document</a>) could conflict with this objective by resulting in unauthorized transfer of scientific and technical information to foreign government entities. Therefore, individuals participating in foreign government talent recruitment programs of foreign countries of risk (currently the list includes Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China) are not eligible to compete. Further, teams that include individuals participating in foreign government talent recruitment programs of foreign countries of risk are not eligible to compete.</li>
  <li>No organization may submit as the lead entity more than one entry to the prize. If an entity is the lead organization on multiple submissions, DOE will accept the most recent submission submitted before the deadline and determine other submissions ineligible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Submissions will be reviewed for eligibility and completeness. Eligibility determinations as well as approval of any waiver requests will be at DOE‚Äôs sole discretion. The application may be deemed ineligible if a competitor does not meet the eligibility criteria or does not provide the items listed in the ‚ÄúWhat to submit‚Äù section of the rules document. Eligible submissions will be evaluated by expert reviewers, who may include officials from OTT or other federal agencies, and/or private sector experts.</p>
