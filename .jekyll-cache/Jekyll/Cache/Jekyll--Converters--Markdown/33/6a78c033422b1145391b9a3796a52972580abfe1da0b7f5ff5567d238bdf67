I"è<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Significant disparities persist among many U.S. subpopulations in their receipt of quality health care. Further, there are multiple social factors that contribute to poor quality care and increased health care spending.</p>
<p>AHRQ seeks to better understand unmet health service delivery needs in communities and develop ways to predict these needs at the population level. Understanding population-level behavior in relation to health care decision making is necessary for providing integrated, coordinated, whole person, 360-degree care; yet, information to support decision making about how to provide the quality health care to populations is incomplete. Evidence has suggested that social determinants of health[1] (SDoH) and community service digital data sets add important information that AHRQ may be able to use to better predict and plan for the optimal use of limited resources, improve population health outcomes, and drive savings.</p>
<h4>Challenge Goal</h4>
<p>The AHRQ Visualization Resources of Community-Level Social Determinants of Health Challenge seeks tools that support visualizing SDoH data clusters to enhance the research and analysis of community-level health services.</p>
<p>Participants must develop visualization tools that draw information from at least three or more free, publicly available data source, whether federal, state or local. They may include data from voice and digital assistance requests via service lines, such as 911 emergency services, 311 community services, and 211 personal referrals for community services.  </p>
<p>A list of these resources are provided on the AHRQ Challenge website.  These tools should be constructed and presented so that AHRQ can apply them in at least two of the following areas:&nbsp; develop studies (data linkage, machine learning, and modeling); relate initial consumer health-seeking behavior; evaluate health status, and; predict needs for emergency, hospital, and community health care services.</p>

<p>[1]Healthy People 2020 defines social determinants of health as the conditions in the environments in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks. Conditions (e.g., social, economic, and physical) in these various environments and settings (e.g., school, church, workplace, and neighborhood) have been referred to as ‚Äúplace.‚Äù In addition to the more material attributes of ‚Äúplace,‚Äù the patterns of social engagement and sense of security and well-being are also affected by where people live. Resources that enhance quality of life can have a significant influence on population health outcomes. Examples of these resources include safe and affordable housing, access to education, public safety, availability of healthy foods, local emergency/health services, and environments free of life-threatening toxins.</p>
