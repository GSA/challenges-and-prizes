<p>Applicants must submit a narrative document describing the team‚Äôs build process, data used, implementation and sustainability plan, in no more than three (3) pages (minimum 11 point standard font, single spaced, 1‚Äù margins, submitted as a .docx or PDF document). This narrative is the team‚Äôs opportunity to address elements of the five judging criteria. The sections below are suggested, but the specific items within each are not intended to be exhaustive and applicants are encouraged to include other points they consider relevant to address the judging criteria, within the stated page limits. <strong>Submissions exceeding the allowed length may not be reviewed.</strong></p>
<ol type="a"> <li><strong>Product overview and functionality:&nbsp; </strong>Explain how the product works, what problem it was intended to solve, the target end user/audience, and an overview of the user journey. </li> <li><strong>Design and build process:&nbsp; </strong>Describe the process used to design and build this product, focusing in particular on strategies employed for end user engagement and any other notable collaboration around product development or implementation, the timeline along which it was created, and where it is now in the product life cycle. As part of their process, teams should have completed user research, such as in-person interviews, focus groups, needs analysis, ethnographic research, or collation of existing research, which should be described in this section.</li> <li><strong>Federal open data used:&nbsp; </strong>Specific types of federal open data used in the product from the Census Bureau or other federal agencies, and what purpose each data set serves in the product. Applicants may also choose, but are not required to highlight what other state, local, or proprietary data they used in the product. </li> <li><strong>Target or documented impact:&nbsp; </strong>Describe the target end users of this product and the problem or user need it aims to address.  What impact do you expect this product will have if it reaches the target users?  If the product is already in use, describe its utilization and impact to date.</li> <li><strong>Product implementation and sustainability plan:&nbsp; </strong>Describe how the product has been or will be implemented (i.e. deployed to and used by the target end users), how the product will be maintained in the long term, and how impact will be tracked (qualitatively and quantitatively). If the product is not already live, indicate the planned time to market, and implementation timeframe. This should address the question:&nbsp; when can end users actually begin to use this product, if not currently? This is not intended to be a business/commercialization plan; the product can but does not necessarily need to generate revenue. </li> </ol>
<p><strong>PART 4:&nbsp; Collaborator letters of support</strong></p>
<p>Teams must submit at least one (1) and up to three (3) letters of support from collaborators on this project who represent user advocates and/or implementation partners.

Each signed letter should indicate how this partner collaborated or will collaborate with the applicant on the specified product, should include the collaborators‚Äô contact information (email and/or phone), and must be <strong>no longer than one page</strong> (minimum 11 point standard font, submitted as a <strong>.docx</strong> or <strong>PDF document</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>PART 5:&nbsp; (Optional) Multimedia supporting documentation </strong></p>
<p>Teams have the option to submit an up to 4-minute video or webinar recording that demonstrates the product‚Äôs functionality.
