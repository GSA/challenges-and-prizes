I"|<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nutrient Pollution, Algal Blooms and Hypoxia</span>    More than 100,000 miles of rivers and streams, close to 2.5 million acres of lakes, reservoirs and ponds, and more than 800 square miles of bays and estuaries in the U.S. have poor water quality due to nitrogen and phosphorus pollution.  Nutrient pollution – excess nitrogen and phosphorus – in U.S. waterways is caused by a number of factors including natural or anthropogenic origins, industrial and municipal wastewater facilities, diffuse runoff from developed land, and agricultural sources.  Further, environmental and geological processes (including precipitation, climate change, soil, and hydrology) can increase or decrease the delivery rate of nutrients into waterways.    Nutrient pollution endangers not only America’s waterways and ecosystems but has significant impact on communities and the individuals that comprise them.  Human health, access to clean drinking water, recreation and tourism industries, real estate values, and local economies are negatively impacted by toxic algal blooms and the low oxygen levels they produce (hypoxia).  While various sectors including government, environmental nonprofits, water utilities and the agriculture community are researching, innovating and, to varying degrees, implementing solutions to reduce excess nutrients in waterways, the voices of citizens and communities, those directly affected, have remained largely absent from the stakeholder table that drives action at the local watershed level.    This Challenge is in support of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/19/fact-sheet-president-s-climate-data-initiative-empowering-america-s-comm">President’s Climate Data Initiative</a>.         <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Open Data</span>    Large quantities of useful data are being collected and maintained in government and non-government open databases in the United States. One of this Challenge’s main goals is to engage data innovator and visualization communities to leverage these open government data resources to help communities better understand the impacts of algal blooms and hypoxia in their waterways and inspire actions to reduce nutrient levels at the individual, collective, and/or community level.         <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Challenge</span>    USGS, US EPA, and Blue Legacy International challenge Solvers to design an innovative visualization that both a) informs individuals/communities on one or more threats, causes, consequences of, facts about, or solutions to nutrient pollution, and b) through compelling visualization, drives them to take action.         <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example Application of Nutrient Data</span>    As just one of many cases, Solvers may consider a recent example of the effect of nutrients on ecosystems and human health: the <a href="http://toledo.oh.gov/news/2014/08/urgent-water-notice/">August 2014 harmful algal bloom (HAB)</a> that was witnessed in Toledo, Ohio, USA. One possible approach for this case would be to develop a data visualization which could serve as a prototype ‘situational awareness dashboard’ related to HABs similar to the Center for Disease Control <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/outbreaks/investigating-outbreaks/SEDRIC-Fact-Sheet.pdf">food-borne illness response system</a>.</p>
