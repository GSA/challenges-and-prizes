<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>The Challenge seeks to develop novel synthesis technologies that use carbon dioxide (CO2) as the sole carbon source to generate molecules that can be used to manufacture a variety of products, including substrates for use in microbial bioreactors. Because CO2 is readily abundant within the Martian atmosphere, such technologies will translate into in-situ manufacturing of products to enable humans to live and thrive on the planet, and also be implemented on Earth by using both waste and atmospheric CO2 as a resource.</p>
<p>Competitors are required to build, demonstrate and produce a product from a system that manufactures simple sugars for microbial bioreactors from CO2 and hydrogen molecules, with the ultimate goal of producing glucose.</p>
<p>NASA is sponsoring the second phase of the CO2 Conversion Challenge with a total prize purse of up to $750,000. Phase 1, the Concept Phase, awarded a prize purse of $250,000 to five (5) teams. Phase 2, the Demonstration Phase, has a total prize purse of up to $750,000. The official rules for Phase 2 will be released prior to the opening of Phase 2.</p>

<!-- Judging start -->
<h3 id="judging-criteria">Judging Criteria</h3>

<p><strong>Judging Panel</strong></p>
<p>A judging panel will be composed of a hybrid team, both internal and external to NASA</p>
<p><strong>Judging Criteria</strong></p>
<p>To qualify to be judged, teams must provide a completed application package, submit a video of the system operating properly and have an interview by phone with a judge. The judge will determine is a team has sufficiently completed the required criteria and the judge will schedule a site visit with the team. The judging panel's evaluation of the submissions will be based on the following scoring criteria:</p>
<p>Product Quality Assessment (100 points): Each team must host a judge for an on-site visit. During this visit, a team must successfully demonstrate the operation of their system and produce enough sample within 7 hours to be analyzed and scored. The product will be collected and analyzed by an independent laboratory for the presence of D-enantiomers of targeted simple sugars. Teams will be assigned scores based on the presence of targeted compounds.</p>
