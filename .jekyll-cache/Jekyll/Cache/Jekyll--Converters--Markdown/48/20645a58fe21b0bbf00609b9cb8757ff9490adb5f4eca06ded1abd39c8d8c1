<p>Studies show that people leaving the criminal justice system have a higher proportion of substance use and mental disorders than the general population. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), an operating division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, invites developers to create an innovative software-based solution, with housing, employment, prevention, treatment and recovery information, to assist offenders and their friends, family, probation officers, jail and prison case workers, and others who help them reintegrate into their communities.    No need to create new content—this is a chance to get creative with how to present existing SAMHSA content and other information (see “REQUIREMENTS” below and the Rules tab for more information).    </p>
