<p>Dr. Jarah Meador, Director of Open Innovation Programs, Challenge.Gov, and CitizenScience.Gov with the General Services Administration (GSA) appeared recently on the Uprisor Podcast. Uprisor focuses on the people driving open innovation, future of work practices, and crowdsourcing.</p>

<p>In this episode, Jarah shares how the U.S. government engages citizens to source innovative ideas, and discusses why government leaders should invest in innovation culture within their own organization in addition to seeking solutions from the outside.</p>

<p>According to Jarah, ‚ÄúWe are seeing an increase in appetite for open innovation across federal agencies‚Ä¶ Some of the greatest minds and subject matter experts exist in government. We‚Äôve seen more agencies building a culture of innovation, so these minds can develop the runway and move forward.‚Äù</p>
