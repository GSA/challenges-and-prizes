I"æ<p>Join with the Office of Digital Innovation and Strategy to develop a smart technology solution in the form of an Application, Application Programming Interface (APIs), and/or Data Mashup for Acquisition, Travel and Public Building Service (PBS).</p>
<p>    The purpose of this notice is to announce a software programming and data innovation competition hosted by GSAâ€™s Office of Digital Innovation and Strategy that will be held on May 8th, 2015. The competition will be open from 9:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.Â  The competition details can be viewed at <a href="http://open.gsa.gov/Digital-Innovation-Hackathon/">http://open.gsa.gov/Digital-Innovation-Hackathon/</a> .Â  </p>
<p>The goal of this competition is to ask the public and academia to develop smart technology solutions in the form of an application, Application Programming Interface (API), and/or data mashup that has the capability to providing GSA with key insights and recommendations for future enhancements.Â  GSA will challenge software developers and designers to create a solution using sample GSA data.</p>
<p> <strong>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</strong> Ms. Cindy A. Smith at cindya.smith@gsa.gov or 816-823-5291.    In this competition, the public is asked to develop a technology-driven solution using GSA data that allows an agency to identify opportunities for improvements and transparency.Â  As such, GSA challenges the public to create a solution using GSA data that could be replicated across government to every agency, using their own data.Â  Sample data sets with GSA data will be provided.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DETAILS OF CHALLENGE:Â  &lt;/strong&gt;Design and create a digital interactive solution in the form of an application, Application Programming Interface (API), and/or data mashup that utilizes federal data collected by GSA. The technology solution should be innovative!Â  GSA does not want an analysis tool that tells what is already known.Â  This should be a forward-thinking solution that enhances transparency.&lt;/p&gt;    The solution should be a data-driven solution to provide meaningful insights that can help drive smarter decisions by federal employees.Â  The ultimate goal is to help federal agencies use data to its fullest, share data with all agencies, and become transparent to the American Public.    The solution should accomplish two tasks:  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Visually display or transmit data in a way that will enhance the way GSA works; and,&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Through analysis of the data identify relationships if they exist, and provide valuable insights that could be gained through improved data collection efforts.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  GSA will assign teams randomly based on the number of participants on the day of the event.Â  No pre-determined team arrangements will be permitted.Â  Modification to team make-up may occur based on team skill make-up at the direction of the competition host.    &lt;strong&gt;DATA:Â  &lt;/strong&gt;Participants will be provided current GSA public data sets to use in designing their solution on the day of the event.Â  Prior to the event, the GitHub page, &lt;a href="http://open.gsa.gov/Digital-Innovation-Hackathon/"&gt;open.gsa.gov/Digital-Innovation-Hackathon/&lt;/a&gt;, will be updated with project details and criteria.    Hackathon projects may include the following:  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;IAE CO Dashboard â€“ A Dashboard that pulls together Contract Report Data, with Vendor information along with Contract Performance information in one location.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Travel Tool â€“ Improvements/Enhancements to the existing Tool.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Public Data Listing Formatting on GitHub â€“ A new way to view all of GSAâ€™s data assets.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Socio-Economic Advisor â€“ Access to specific Vendor data (Products, Services, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Energy Use/Cost by Building/Effect on TSS â€“ Identify drivers and relationships.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;REGISTRATION:Â  &lt;/strong&gt;Registration for this event will be accomplished online at the following link &lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/us-general-services-administration-gsa-hack-a-thon-tickets-15637828165"&gt;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/us-general-services-administration-gsa-hack-a-thon-tickets-15637828165&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;andÂ shall remain open until May 5, 2015, &lt;strong&gt;(11:59 p.m. EST). Â &lt;/strong&gt;The event space is limited to the first 120 people; once registration is complete you shall receive a confirmation email.
