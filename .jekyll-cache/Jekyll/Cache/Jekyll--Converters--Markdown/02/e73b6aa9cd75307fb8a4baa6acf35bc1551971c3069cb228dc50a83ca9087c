Participants agree to assume any and all risks and waive claims against the federal government and its related entities, except in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue, or profits, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising from participation in this competition, whether the injury, death, damage, or loss arose through negligence or otherwise. </p>
<p>Participants also agree to obtain liability insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility, to cover a third party for death, bodily injury, property damage, or loss resulting from an activity carried out in connection with participation in this competition, with the Federal Government named as an additional insured under the registered participant’s insurance policy and registered participants agreeing to indemnify the Federal Government against third party claims for damages arising from or related to the competition activities, and the Federal Government for damage or loss to Government property resulting from such an activity.</p>
<p>As GSA is under a strict duty not to give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual, participants must agree to take diligent care to avoid the appearance of Government endorsement of competition participation and submission.  Participants must agree not to refer to GSA’s use of your submission (be it product or service) in any commercial advertising or similar promotions in a manner that could reasonably imply (in the judgment of a reasonable person) that the GSA or the federal government endorses, prefers, sponsors, or has an affiliation with participants’ products or services.</p>
<p>Participants agree that GSA’s trademarks, logos, service marks, trade names, or the fact that GSA awarded a prize to a participant, shall not be used by the participant to imply direct GSA endorsement of participant or participant’s submission.  Both participants and GSA may list the other party’s name in a publicly available customer or other list so long as the name is not displayed in a more prominent fashion than any other third-party name.    <strong>Requirements</strong>    The final solution should be open source code and placed on a GSA site to be specified to participants the day of the event. “Open source” refers to a program in which the source code is available to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design free of charge.</p>
<p>In order to be Open Source Initiative Certified, the solution must meet the following ten criteria:  <ol>    <li>The author or holder of the license of the source code cannot collect royalties on the distribution of the program;</li>    <li>The distributed program must make the source code accessible to the user;</li>    <li>The author must allow modifications and derivations of the work under the program’s original name;</li>    <li>No person, group, or field of endeavor can be denied access to the program;</li>    <li>The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program being part of a particular software distribution; and</li>    <li>The licensed software cannot place restrictions on other software that is distributed   with it;</li>    <li>The solution must be an online, interactive solution that meets the goals and objectives provided in this document;</li>    <li> The solution must include documentation of all data sources used;</li>    <li> The solution must include a description of how the solution can be updated with additional data from other agencies;</li>    <li> The solver must provide recommendations to enhance Government insights through improvement in data collection.</li>  </ol></p>
