<p><strong>Update on Future ASAPS Funding Opportunities</strong></p>

<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division conducted Contest 1 of the Automated Streams Analysis for Public Safety (ASAPS) Prize Challenge in 2020 and awarded $180,000 to six teams for their innovative approaches to four topic areas. NIST originally planned for three follow-on prize competitions; however, in place of follow-on contests, NIST will release the ASAPS Development Data for open research and may open new <a href="https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/funding-opportunities">funding opportunities</a> in FY22. The robust dataset includes eight continuous hours of over 40 multimodal data streams annotated for 62 emergency events and their corresponding evidence.

<p><strong>Winners of ASAPS Contest 1 – Concept Paper</strong></p>

<p>NIST awarded the following six teams $30,000 each for their novel approaches to extracting information from multimodal data streams. Two teams tied as winners for Topic 2; thus, NIST awarded six cash prizes – one more than initially planned.

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The Public Safety Communications Research Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology is conducting the Automated Streams Analysis for Public Safety (ASAPS) Prize Challenge, authorized under Section 105 of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (Pub. L. No 111-358), as codified in 15 U.S.C. § 3719.</p>

<p>This challenge anticipates awarding prizes to challenge contestants who submit innovative approaches that address information extraction across ASAPS multimodal data streams and perform fusion in real time across extracted data to generate actionable data reports about simulated and staged emergency events. One of the most important objectives of this program is to demonstrate how data can be used to enable decision support tools and capabilities for public safety. This challenge is a nationwide innovation contest taking place throughout 2020, 2021, and 2022. The challenge is anticipated to be administered in four discrete contests. In the context of multiple contests, these are the official rules for Contest 1 only.</p>

<p>Contest 1 will focus on developing innovative “plans of attack” focused on data extraction and fusion, refining and focusing the details relevant to the ASAPS Challenge’s problem statement, partnering between contestants to form highly qualified teams, and encouraging collaborative and creative thought around potential approaches to developing solutions. NIST anticipates awarding up to $150,000 in cash to winning contestants in Contest 1. In addition, contestants will be familiarized with the development data set and version 1.0 of the test harness and encouraged to provide feedback for potential updates in advance of the second contest.</p>

<p>The area of real-time automated analytics is understudied – especially with regards to the analytic fusion of multiple sources of unstructured information in real-time. The future of public safety demands automated solutions to analyze live data, provide improved situational awareness, and alert and inform decision making.</p>

<p>Extracting information from video, audio and textual communications, social media, and sensors presents a significant analytic challenge. It is virtually impossible for humans to co-analyze these data streams in real-time, and, currently, there are few automated tools to analyze these types of unstructured data in real-time and virtually no automated tools to create dynamic analytic models of public safety emergencies as emergency situations
evolve.</p>

<p>With the maturation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, specialized architectures and processors for AI applications, cloud computing, high-speed communications networks and streaming data resources and protocols, it is now possible to create automated tools to assist public safety organizations in analyzing the increasingly large amounts of information at their fingertips to help them make the most informed decisions based on a comprehensive analysis of the data available. Such tools will help distill, structure, and present
the quickly evolving information from a multitude of data streams to public safety organizations in a way that supports time-critical decision making and serves as an essential force multiplier.</p>

<p>Due to the multitude of sensors and devices being used in public safety along with communications data collected in operations and contributed by the public, and the multi-modal nature of all of these data streams, transforming data, especially unstructured data, into information in real-time is one of the key technology gaps that must be bridged to achieve advances in this area. The available technology is insufficient to bridge this technological gap because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most automated data analysis tools have been developed for use with archival data and focus on post-event forensic analysis.</li>
  <li>Few analytic technologies focus on a moving representation of live streaming data that is updated over time, and that can be used to show temporal changes in the analysis.</li>
  <li>Tools that make data available to first responders in real-time are heavily weighted towards a visual representation of responder location and structured reporting of known emergency communications.</li>
  <li>Few public safety emergency analysis tools exist that provide an effective real-time automated analysis and fusion of information from unstructured public safety communications streams and sensor- and citizen-generated data streams.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that while public safety organizations must often grapple with answering the who, what, when, and where of emergencies, the research supported by this Challenge focuses only on the what, when, and where aspects of streaming data analysis and specifically excludes identity-related technologies such as facial and voice biometrics which are considered out of scope for this research program - with the exception of technology to maintain scene-relative identification of people/vehicle/object/place entities involved in emergencies in order to associate activities with the entities they are involved with. This focus of the Challenge is because the area of identifying the situational and time-critical evolving characteristics of an emergency across information streams is under-researched. This Challenge seeks to focus research on analyzing a plethora of fast-moving data streams for
life/infrastructure-critical situational information to support both effective and efficient response.</p>

<p>Public safety organizations are inundated with live streaming data from a variety of sources. This live streaming data generally falls into two categories - some of this data is structured, while much of it is unstructured. Structured data that resides in a fixed field within a record or file (the kind typically found in spreadsheets or relational databases) is formatted in a way so that it can be readily queried. By contrast, unstructured data (e.g., video and audio) generally does not have a pre-<em>defined data</em> model or is not organized in a pre-<em>defined</em> manner and, therefore, is not readily searchable. The lack of a defined data model prevents the data from being automatically interpreted and used by automated decision support applications without significant human intervention.</p>

<p>In this first contest, NIST PSCR is inviting a novel multidisciplinary community to share its vision for how to analyze numerous live data streams, understand the data, and transform it into information to support public safety decisions. We are looking for ideas that address the following analytic tasks as well as an overall extraction to analysis systems platform approach to the contest elements. The core analytic tasks for this contest can be
broadly described as:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Information extraction across data streams and data sources:</strong> Structured information is continuously extracted from each of the data streams that are necessary to support downstream analysis and detection of emergency events.</li>
  <li><strong>Information fusion across extracted data and generation of live/dynamic information representation:</strong> Joint inferencing is performed across all of the information in the extracted streams to create an event-level analysis of an emergency and store that information in a dynamically evolving structured data
representation that can be utilized at any time during the life of an emergency.</li>
  <li><strong>Automated emergency event analysis:</strong> Highly actionable analytic reports about emergency events are generated from the extracted/fused structured information (as described in the above topics) into a form that can be readily rendered into actionable user-readable reports in real-time and in both ongoing and summary forms.</li>
</ol>

<p>Success in this ideation contest is dependent upon a clear vision of the   components, platform, and novel approaches that fulfill the functions of real-time information extraction, live dynamic information fusion and
representation, and evolving emergency event analysis.</p>
