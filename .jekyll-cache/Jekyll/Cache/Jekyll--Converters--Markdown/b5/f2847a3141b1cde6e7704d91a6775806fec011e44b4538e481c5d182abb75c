The $1 millionÂ prize targets systems used at homes or multi-use sites to supplement the current development of hydrogen fueling station infrastructure. Successful entries will install and test systems that generate hydrogen from resources available to most homes, electricity and/or natural gas, and dispense the hydrogen into vehicles. Winners will demonstrate that they can meet the technical and cost criteria outlined in the final guidelines. The contestant that demonstrates the best system will be awarded a $1 million cash prize.</p>
