I"±<h4 id="judging-panel">Judging Panel</h4>

<p>A panel of subject matter experts selected by EPA, USDA and the Challenge collaborators will judge submissions based on pre-defined scoring criteria. The panel will initially screen submissions for completeness and relevance. The selected eligible applications will then be judged using the criteria specified below. Judges will be selected based on several criteria, including their technical expertise (e.g. chemistry, agronomy, microbiology, biogeochemistry, ecology), geography (e.g. Midwest, South, etc.), associations with land grant universities, sectoral experience (e.g. farming, academia, government, industry), and diversity. All judges will be required to sign Conflict of Interest (COI) agreement to ensure unbiased reviews, and Non-Disclosure agreements to ensure confidentiality of any CBI. All persons or entities that submit a solution will be notified as to the status of their submission and a high-level evaluation. Decisions cannot be contested.</p>

<h4 id="judging-criteria">Judging Criteria</h4>

<p>For Stage 1, the Judging Panel will evaluate submissions based on four performance areas, which will be allotted points (up to a total of 100). Submissions invited to Stage 2 will submit a physical product for testing at the IFDC based on agreed-upon protocols.</p>

<p><strong>Scoring Overview</strong></p>

<p><strong>Stage 1.</strong> Within performance areas, there are additional criteria that will be evaluated. For example, there are five environmental and three agronomic criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Environmental performance: 35 points</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of N leaching/runoff: 7 points</li>
      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of P leaching/runoff: 7 points</li>
      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of NH3 volatilization: 7 points</li>
      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of N2O emissions: 7 points</li>
      <li>No toxic residue left on the field or in the runoff or leachate: 7 points (For the purposes of this Challenge, ‚Äútoxic residues‚Äù refers to prevalent and biologically active degradates formed from decomposition (via either biotic and abiotic processes) of the product in the environment. Please include the names and unique CAS numbers (if available) for any active and inactive ingredients of the solution and its degradants. Toxicity and prevalence can be described by a number of means, including existing eco-toxicology and environmental fate studies, summaries from either the <a href="https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard">EPA CompTox Chemicals Dashboard</a> or the <a href="https://cfpub.epa.gov/ecotox/">EPA ECOTOX Knowledgebase</a>, or whether the constituent chemicals are already listed under the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/safer-ingredients">EPA Safer Chemical Ingredients List</a>. Although this criteria does not pertain to inhibitor effects on target organisms (e.g., soil bacteria), which are toxic by design, it does pertain to any decomposition byproducts of inhibitors and other potential solutions, and effects that may occur for non-target organisms)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agronomic performance: 35 points</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Yield relative to conventional fertilizer: 15 points</li>
      <li>Return on investment (ROI): 10 points</li>
      <li>Compatibility with existing supply chain machinery and practices: 10 points</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other performance criteria: 20 points</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Addresses multiple loss pathways: 10 points</li>
      <li>Applicability to other crops and environmental conditions: 5 points</li>
      <li>Market penetration: 5 points</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expert discretion points: 10 points</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Judging Panel will assign points to metrics and criteria based on the rubric above and their combined expert judgement given the degree of information submitted in the solutions. This ‚Äúscorecard‚Äù will be made available to the Solver at the announcement of Stage 1 winners.</p>

<p>The example rubric above is for a solution that addresses N and P. For solutions that address only one nutrient (e.g. N), the possible points for the other nutrient (e.g. P) will be zeroed out such that the total points possible will be less than 100 (i.e. 90 points possible for N-only solution, 80 total points possible for P-only solution).</p>

<p>As an example, the following are qualities of an ideal solution:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Compatible with existing corn farming machinery and practices;</li>
  <li>Reduces N and P leaching and runoff by 45% or more;</li>
  <li>Reduces NH3 volatilization by 25% or more;</li>
  <li>Reduces N2O emissions by 25% or more;</li>
  <li>Does not leave any toxic residue after degradation;</li>
  <li>Increases yield;</li>
  <li>Is estimated to be a net profit for farmers (i.e. the revenue from yield increases offset the up-front cost increases for the new technology);</li>
  <li>Has good environmental and agronomic performance under a range of environmental conditions;</li>
  <li>Is widely available and potentially applicable to other crops.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Stage 2.</strong> The planned IFDC trials are designed to evaluate a key subset of the criteria and metrics above. The greenhouse and laboratory trials will yield information on four environmental and three agronomic criteria. We will use a similar scoring rubric as with Stage 1, but with modifications since the IFDC trials will not test for certain criteria (e.g. toxicity of residue, compatibility with existing machinery).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Environmental performance: 50 points</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of N leaching</li>
      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of P leaching</li>
      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of NH3 volatilization</li>
      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of N2O emissions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agronomic performance: 50 points</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Yield relative to conventional fertilizer</li>
      <li>Nitrogen use efficiency</li>
      <li>Phosphorus use efficiency</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Draft protocols for the planned IFDC greenhouse tests are available by request. Additional details of the IFDC scoring and testing protocols will be made following announcement of the Stage 1 winners, and will depend on the number of EEFs and soil types to be tested.</p>
