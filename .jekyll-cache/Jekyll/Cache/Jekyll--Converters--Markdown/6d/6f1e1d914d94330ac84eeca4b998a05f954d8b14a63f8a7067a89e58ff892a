I"”<p>This effort will focus on reducing the cost and complexity of collecting nutrient data, to ultimately facilitate better environmental management and stewardship, while stimulating innovation and private sector growth. The goal is for next-generation sensors developed through the Challenge to:  &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;be easy to use in maintenance-free deployments of up toÂ three months,&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;cost less than $5,000 to purchase,&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;and be commercially available by 2017.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  REGISTER HERE:Â <a href="http://www.nutrients-challenge.org/">www.nutrients-challenge.org</a></p>
