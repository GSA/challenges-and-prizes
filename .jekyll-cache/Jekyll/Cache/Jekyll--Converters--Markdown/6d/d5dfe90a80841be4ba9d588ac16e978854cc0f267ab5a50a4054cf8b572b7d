I"ð<p>The Humans in Space Art and NASAs International Space Station Programs invite college students and early career professionals to take a journey with us. Video artwork can be of any style, and individuals or teams of participants can submit an entry. Younger artists can also participate, but their artwork will be judged in the same categories as older artists.  Artwork will be made visible worldwide and flown in orbit on the Space Station. See Competition website for more information.</p>
