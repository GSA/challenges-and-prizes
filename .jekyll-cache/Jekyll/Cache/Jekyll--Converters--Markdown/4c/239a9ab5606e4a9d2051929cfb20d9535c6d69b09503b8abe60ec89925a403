I"F<h4>How will submitted prototypes in Part 2 of the challenge be judged?</h4>
<p>Judges will evaluate a collection of prototypes submitted. Based on the scoring, a single winning submission will be identified. A submission is considered a functional prototype at any stage of maturity (e.g. beta, v1.0, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>2nd Round of Judging&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>All entries will first be screened for compliance with the rules.&nbsp; All compliant submissions will be scored by a panel of judges, using the following four criteria:&nbsp;</p>
<ul> <li><strong>Creativity (20%):</strong> <ul> <li>Extent to which the proposed solution demonstrates uniqueness and innovation</li> <li>Extent to which the proposed solution demonstrates originality and ability to fill a gap and/or answer a question in a unique manner</li> <li>Extent to which concept demonstrates use of advanced technologies</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Clarity of concepts and ideas (20%):</strong> <ul> <li>The prototype is clearly and accurately illustrated through the visual representation of the solution/solution set.</li> <li>Extent to which the proposed solution indicates why it is an improvement over existing products and/or how it fills a need</li> <li>Extent to which proposed solution can improve employee engagement with development opportunities</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Communicating concept in an accessible and exciting way (20%):</strong> <ul> <li>Extent to which proposed solution demonstrates the potential value for stakeholders</li> <li>Extent to which proposed solution demonstrates ability to coordinate with relevant stakeholders, such as academia, industry, Federal systems</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Performance and Usability (40%)</strong> <ul> <li>Demonstrates use of best practices. Prototype leverages user-centric design, in line help, secure technologies, etc.</li> <li>Extent to which the proposed solution demonstrates how the design elements will attract, engage, and influence users to take intended action</li> <li>Extent to which the proposed solution provides evidence that it is replicable and scalable; potential for use in other and/or larger settings must be addressed</li> <li>How well the proposed solution is positioned for use in the marketplace, both in the public and the private sectors</li> <li>How well the proposed solution demonstrates potential of user acceptance of the product</li> <li>Extent to which proposed solution demonstrates product functionality; the product should be functional as described in the competition overview</li> <li>Extent to which proposed solution demonstrates implementation feasibility across intended platforms, sites, and/or users</li> <li>Extent to which proposed solution indicates potential for sustainability and profitability</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
