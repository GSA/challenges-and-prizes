I" <p>The U.S. Department of Education (Department) is announcing the Rural Tech Project (Challenge), a new challenge supported with funds reserved under Title IV, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) for purposes of technical assistance and capacity building to support Title IV, Part A. The Challenge invites rural high schools to bring innovative solutions to the implementation of distance learning-enabled, competency-based technology instruction to prepare students for postsecondary education and careers in the technology workforce of today and tomorrow.</p>

<p>The Challenge seeks solutions that use distance learning to provide rural communities access to competency-based education (CBE) programs in technology-related career pathways with a goal of increasing instructional capacity.</p>

<p>Rural communities often lack the instructional capacity to deliver high-quality career and technical education (CTE) in technology education pathways. Distance learning- enabled models can help address capacity constraints by facilitating education delivery with limited staff and minimal or no in-person interaction among instructors or peers, which provides for the potential to increase access to in-demand technology career pathways in rural communities. CBE models allow students to progress at their own pace through a sequence of personalized learning experiences, where students advance their education by demonstrating mastery of a subject or concept. Expanding these models to rural high school students, with a focus on technology pathways, would increase access to qualified educators and expand opportunities for students to earn industry certifications and credentials. The progress of the finalists and the models and practices emerging from the Challenge will be shared on the Challenge website.</p>

<h4 id="phase-descriptions">Phase Descriptions</h4>

<p>The Challenge will be conducted in two phases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Phase 1: Open Submissions (June 30 - October 8, 2020)</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>During Phase 1, high schools and local educational agencies (LEAs) enter the Challenge by completing the submission process outlined on the Challenge webpage. Schools should coordinate their entries with their LEAs to ensure the entries represent an aligned effort, if applicable. At least one online informational session will be held during Phase 1.</li>
      <li><strong>Judging:</strong> Entrants who fulfill the criteria described in the Eligibility section of this announcement and complete a submission that meets all entry requirements in the Submission Information section of this announcement will be eligible for judging. Independent judges will review eligible Phase 1 submissions using the Finalist Selection Criteria, which are included in the Award Selection Criteria section of this announcement and will recommend finalists to the Department. Up to five finalists will be selected from the group of eligible entrants and invited to participate in Phase 2.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Phase 2: Community Implementation (January 2021 - August 2023)</strong>  </p>

    <ul>
      <li>During Phase 2, finalists will have the opportunity to receive curated and customized technical assistance to finalize their proposed program plans in preparation for implementation. With support from a local community engagement manager selected by the entrant, finalists will launch programs for a first cohort of students. Finalists will collect data on the first cohorts’ performance metrics, identifying successes and opportunities for improvement. Finalists will evolve program designs and implement program changes while continuing to receive technical assistance. Finalists will also create sustainability plans. After the completion of Phase 2, finalists will document their outcomes and lessons learned in a formal submission for evaluation by the Phase 2 judging panel. This submission will include a detailed description of how schools implemented distance learning-enabled, competency-based technology education; the results and lessons learned from implementation; and effective practices for rural, competency-based technology education program design. The Phase 2 finalist submission will also require documentation of efforts to align programs to one or more technology career paths.</li>
      <li><strong>Judging:</strong> Independent judges will review Phase 2 submissions using the Winner Selection Criteria, which are included in the Award Selection Criteria section of this announcement, and recommend to the Department which finalist should be selected as a grand prize winner based on the submission. Subject to approval by the Department, finalists may all be eligible to receive an award (to be determined at a later date).</li>
