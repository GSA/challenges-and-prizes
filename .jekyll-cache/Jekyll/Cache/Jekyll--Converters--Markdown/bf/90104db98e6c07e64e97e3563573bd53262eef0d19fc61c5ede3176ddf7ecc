<p>The <strong>Artisanal Mining Grand Challenge: the Amazon</strong> is a global call for solutions awarding more than $1 million in prizes and support for innovations to make artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in the Amazon more environmentally responsible and socially equitable.</p>

<p>Conservation X Labs (CXL) is administering the Challenge, with funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Microsoft, and ESRI, and technical input from the Center for Amazonian Scientific Innovation (CINCIA) and strategic implementation from the USAID/Peru Prevent project - Combating Environmental Crimes (Prevent).</p>

<p>We are seeking innovations at the prototype or piloting stage that:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Safeguard ecosystems</strong> and prevent, remediate, and restore impacts from ASGM at mining sites on biodiversity, water resources, and human health;</li>
  <li><strong>Optimize responsible supply chains</strong> to increase transparency and traceability and enable gold purchasing that is environmentally responsible and socially equitable from the point of origin to its final sale;</li>
  <li><strong>Promote and sustain formalization</strong> of miners in the ASGM sector to achieve environmental and social safeguards and regulatory compliance.</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of the Challenge is to provide promising innovators with funding and support to help innovations achieve environmental and social impact, become financially sustainable, and scale. Participating in this Challenge offers a number of benefits beyond just funding and monetary prizes, including access to a network of experts and leaders in the space; the opportunity to meet and learn from peers working on cutting-edge products and tools; mentorship on business and product development; opportunities to conduct field-testing and receive feedback from users and customers; and recognition and validation from our world-class evaluation panel.</p>
