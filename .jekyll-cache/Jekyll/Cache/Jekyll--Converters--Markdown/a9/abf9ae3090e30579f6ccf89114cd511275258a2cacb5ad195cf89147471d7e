I"∑<p>The NIJ is announcing its Gun Safety Technology Challenge, which will test the reliability of firearms that have integrated and advanced safety technologies. Such advanced safety technologies could benefit users with improved personalization and added protections from theft and unauthorized use. However, the potential impact of these safety technologies on the reliability of firearms remains a concern. As discussed in the 2013 NIJ report entitled ‚Äú<a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/242500.pdf">A Review of Gun Safety Technologies</a>,‚Äù these concerns need to be addressed both for potential impact on firearm performance and for garnering user acceptance of safety technologies.¬† The Challenge will seek ‚Äúapples to apples‚Äù comparisons to the extent possible, such that firearms both with, and without, these advanced gun safety technologies are tested and evaluated using a common methodology and equivalent ammunition.</p>
