<p><span lang="EN">The ASA(ALT) recognizes that the Army must enhance engagements with the entrepreneurial funded community, small businesses, and other non-traditional defense entities, by:&nbsp; (1) understanding the spectrum of technologies being developed commercially that may benefit the Army; (2) integrating the sector of non-traditional defense entities into the Army&rsquo;s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) ecosystem; and (3) providing mentorship and expertise to accelerate, mature, and transition technologies of interest to the Army.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The xTechSearch program will provide resourcing to select small businesses to demonstrate proof of concept for their technologies pertaining to Army challenges.&nbsp; The program will also integrate these small businesses into the Army&rsquo;s S&amp;T ecosystem by providing research opportunities with Army labs, including access to the Army&rsquo;s organic intellectual and technical capital.&nbsp; xTechSearch is an opportunity for businesses to pitch novel technology solutions &ndash; a new application for an existing technology or a new technology concept entirely &ndash; to the Army.&nbsp; The Army will provide non-dilutive seed prizes for the small businesses to demonstrate proof of concept in an Army-relevant challenge area.&nbsp; </span></p>
