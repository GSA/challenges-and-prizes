I"E<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), USDA, is announcing the I-FAST prize competition (the “I-FAST Competition” or the “Competition”) to develop and implement the Innovations in Food and Agricultural Science and Technology (I-FAST) Program. NIFA will partner with the National Science Foundation (NSF) Innovation Corps (I-Corps) to provide entrepreneurship training to NIFA grantees under this I-FAST pilot program. The goals are to identify valuable product opportunities that can emerge from NIFA supported academic research. Selected NIFA I-FAST project teams will participate in the educational programs with NSF I-Corps Program. Over a period of six months the NIFA supported teams in the I-FAST program will learn what it will take to achieve an economic impact with their particular innovation. The final goal of the I-FAST Competition is to facilitate technology transfer of innovations that can make an impact in the marketplace and the global economy.    <strong>Subject of Challenge Competition:</strong>    The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), USDA, mission is to invest in and advance agricultural research, education, and extension to solve societal challenges. As part of this mission NIFA is charged with providing grant funding for research, education, and extension that address key problems of national, regional, and multi-state importance in sustaining all components of agriculture. A majority of NIFA grant funding is provided to academic institutions to focus on developing research in the areas of farm efficiency and profitability, ranching, renewable energy, forestry (both urban and agroforestry), aquaculture, rural communities and entrepreneurship, human nutrition, food safety, biotechnology, and conventional breeding.    NIFA will partner with the NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) who will provide an Entrepreneurial Immersion course and training to NIFA grantees through this I-FAST Competition. The goals of this Competition are to spur translation of fundamental research to the market place, to encourage collaboration between academia and industry, and to train NIFA-funded faculty, students and other researchers to understand innovation and entrepreneurship.    The purpose of the I-FAST Competition is to identify NIFA-funded research teams (an I-FAST team includes the Principal Investigator (PI), the Entrepreneurial Lead, and the Mentor) who will receive additional support, in the form of mentoring, training, and funding to accelerate the translation of knowledge derived from fundamental research into emerging products and services that can attract subsequent third-party funding. NIFA-funded research teams will be required to participate in Entrepreneurial Immersion courses provided by the NSF I-Corps program. The NSF I-Corps is a program specifically designed to broaden the impact of select, basic research projects by preparing scientists and engineers to focus beyond the laboratory. Leveraging experience and guidance from established entrepreneurs and a targeted curriculum within the NSF I-Corp program, NIFA I-FAST teams will learn to identify valuable product opportunities that can emerge from NIFA supported academic research. The I-FAST Competition will help create a stronger national ecosystem for innovation that couples scientific discovery with technology development to address agricultural and societal needs.    <strong>DATES:</strong> Competition Submission Period – Pre-Application and Evaluation Interviews:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Pre-Application Open Period: July 13, 2018 to August 3, 2018.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Pre-Application Evaluation and Interviews: August 6, 2018 to August 9, 2018.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Full Application Open Period: August 10, 2018 to August 17, 2018.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Final Evaluation and Judging – Full Application: August 20, 2018 to August 22, 2018.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Verification of Winners: August 23, 2018.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Announcement of Winner(s): August 24, 2018.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  NSF I-Corps Training for Winner(s): Winning team(s) will need to be available to travel to and attend one of the following NSF I-Corps training sessions with the following dates and locations:    Fall 2018 COHORTS:    Fall Cohort #1: Location TBD (Likely Detroit, MI)  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Kickoff (on-site): September (arrive 25) 26-28, 2018.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Web sessions (online): Thursdays 1:00-4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) – October 4, 11, 18, 25 and November 1, 2018.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Lessons Learned (on-site): November 8-9, 2018.
