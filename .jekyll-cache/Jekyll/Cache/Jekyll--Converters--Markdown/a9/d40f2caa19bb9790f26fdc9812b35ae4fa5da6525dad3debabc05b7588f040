I"$<p><strong>Judging Panel</strong></p>

<p>Technical reviewers with expertise relevant to the Challenge will evaluate the solutions based on their ability to achieve the criteria listed below. Technical reviewers will be comprised of experts sourced from the Federal government, academia, industry, and other sectors as deemed relevant. The solutions and evaluation statements from the technical reviewers will then be reviewed by federal employees serving as judges, who will select up to 10 Challenge winners for Phase 1, as well as any honorable mentions subject to the final decision by the Award Approving Official.</p>

<p>The Award Approving Official will be the BARDA Director.</p>

<p><strong>Judging Criteria</strong></p>

<p>Proposals will be graded on the following metrics, in no particular order of importance, by a panel of federal judges, which may also include initial rounds of review by a panel of subject matter experts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Technological Feasibility (35 points)</strong>. Submission demonstrates a reasonable rationale for the design of the mask, proposes an intuitive design that can be used without fitting or prior training, and contains components that are easily accessible for production.</li>
  <li><strong>Innovation (25 points).</strong> Submission advances the state of the art in filtration efficacy, comfort, and utility of masks used by the general public. Additional considerations include the scientific evidence and rationale behind the proposed filtration or particle reduction/removal mechanism, clear demonstration of comfort, and the ability to tailor the fit of the mask to different face shapes (i.e., women, children, those with facial hair or glasses, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Barriers (25 points).</strong> Submission addresses barriers and limitations of currently available masks; proposed innovations are based on scientific and technical merit.</li>
  <li><strong>Overall (15 points).</strong> Submission is realistic, well-rounded, and presents a compelling solution that should be considered further.</li>
</ul>
