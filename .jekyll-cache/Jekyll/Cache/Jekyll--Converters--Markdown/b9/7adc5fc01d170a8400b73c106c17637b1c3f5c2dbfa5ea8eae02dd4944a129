<p>All xTechSearch submissions are treated as privileged information and contents are disclosed to Government employees or designated support contractors only for the purpose of evaluation and program support.</p>
<p>Detailed feedback will be provided to all participants at the end of each phase.&nbsp; The purpose of providing this feedback is to help accelerate transition of the technology to an Army user by providing insight on best applications for the technology within the Army, suggestions for product improvement for Army use, and recommended next steps for development.&nbsp; However, the Government will not respond to questions or inquiries regarding this feedback.</p>
<p>While the authority of this program is 15 USC &sect;3719, a concept white paper submitted to the xTechSearch program may generate interest by another Army organization for a funding opportunity outside of this program (e.g., submission of a proposal under a Broad Agency Announcement).&nbsp; The interested Army organization may contact the participant to provide additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Submission Format</strong></p>
<p>The xTechSearch initial submission is a concept white paper.&nbsp; Please adhere to the following requirements:</p>
<ul> <li>All concept white papers must be submitted using the template found on the registration page, &ldquo;xTechSearch_5_WhitePaper_Template.doc&rdquo;. Any proposals submitted in a format other than that provided by the template will not be reviewed.&nbsp;</li> <li>Please list your company name, and proposal title EXACTLY how you would like them to appear on any contest marketing materials, recommend clear and concise proposal titles to give readers and potential stakeholders understanding of how your technology would benefit the Army.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Army Focus Areas</strong></p>
<p>xTechSearch seeks novel, disruptive concepts and technologies to support the top Army Modernization Priorities, Army Medical Technologies, Military Engineering Technologies, as well as other critical technology focus areas within the Army Research and Technology portfolio that can provide technology overmatch or enable cost savings throughout the Army systems&rsquo; life cycle.&nbsp; See attached document on the registration page for a list of the top Army Modernization Priorities and other critical Army Focus Areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
