I"M<p><strong>*Important Update to Key Dates</strong>: Please note that the Concept White Paper submission deadline has been extended to 16 October 2020, 11:59 PM PT and the Invitations for the Semifinal Technology Pitch will be sent on 9 November, 2020.  These changes are reflected in the Key Dates table below.</p>

<p>The US Army Medical Research and Development Command (MRDC) is announcing the xTech Brain Operant Learning Technology – xTechBOLT – prize competition.  The prize competition is designed to incentivize industry to develop and demonstrate the use of one or more tool(s) (e.g., QEEG, fMRI, MEG, BIOMRK, NIRS, PET, MEA, SPECT, or other) to locate, track, and trace four types of learning traits, including explicit and implicit knowledge, from exposure to storage, and use those neural pathways to capture emotions and empathy and research a proof of concept mechanism (software or hardware, or both) that could be developed to promote optimal retention and access to memories.</p>

<p>The goals for this competition are to understand the effects of emotion and empathy on learning and memory and the functional roles played by various brain regions and their mutual interactions in relation to emotional and empathetic processing and effect on both implicit and explicit learning.  Understanding these effects will help build the United States Military of the future, by revolutionizing how we teach and train Warfighters, how we build better medical providers, and how we utilize novel brain operant learning technologies.</p>

<p>The Army (and more broadly the U.S. Department of Defense) seek “path finding” teams and technologies through this competition. Therefore, xTechBOLT is not interested in low-risk, repackaged approaches of tried and true techniques. We aim to find early-stage innovations with the potential to dramatically improve military training outcomes with novel hardware- and/or software-based technologies.</p>

<p>xTechBOLT is seeking applicants to use one or more tool(s) (e.g., QEEG, fMRI, MEG, BIOMRK, NIRS, PET, MEA, SPECT, or other) to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Locate, track, and trace four types of learning traits including explicit and implicit knowledge from exposure to storage, and use those neural pathways to capture emotions and empathy from exposure to storage;</li>
  <li>Research a proof of concept technology which may include software or hardware, or both that could be developed to promote optimal retention and access to memories.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Army recognizes that it must enhance engagements with innovative problem solvers, by: (1) understanding the spectrum of technologies under development commercially that may benefit the Army; (2) integrating small business innovators into the Army’s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) ecosystem; and (3) providing mentorship and expertise to accelerate, mature, and transition technologies of interest to the Army.</p>

<p>The xTechBOLT competition will provide increasing non-dilutive prizes to select applicants to proceed in the competition.  All applications will be reviewed by Army subject matter experts and up to 10 applicants with the highest ranking concept white papers will receive a prize of $10,000 each and advance to give a pitch on their proposed concept to a live Army judging panel.  The live judging panel will select five (5) applicants to receive additional awards of $25,000 each and be invited to present a proof-of-concept of their technology solutions at the 2021 Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC) in Orlando, Florida.  Out of those five (5) finalists, a grand prize winner will be selected and awarded an additional $500,000 prize.  The remaining finalists will receive prizes as follows: Second place - $125,000.00, Third place – $75,000.00, Fourth place - $50,000.00, Fifth place - $25,000.00.  Details on the prize structure are listed below in this announcement.</p>
