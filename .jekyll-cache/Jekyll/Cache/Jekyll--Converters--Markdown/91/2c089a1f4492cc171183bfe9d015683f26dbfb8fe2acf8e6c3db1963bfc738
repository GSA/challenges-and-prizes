I"?)<p>EPA has selected two awardees of the <a href="https://developer.epa.gov/smart-city-air-challenge/">Smart City Air Challenge</a>: the City of Baltimore and the Lafayette, La. Consolidated Government. For more information about the challenge and webinars about data management of community air quality projects, visit the challenge website at <a href="https://developer.epa.gov/smart-city-air-challenge/">https://developer.epa.gov/smart-city-air-challenge/</a>. The agency also has recognized four projects for honorable mention: New York City; Mesa County, Colo.; Raleigh, N.C. and Minneapolis/St. Paul.    The following two projects were selected as awardee recipients:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<em><strong>An Air Quality Sensor Network for Greater Baltimore</strong>:</em> This Baltimore project incorporates plans to engage several partners and neighborhoods to deploy a network of sensors in a phased approach, leveraging a scalable cloud platform for data management. They plan to assemble commercially-available components to build their sensor system and distribute the data on a City of Baltimore website.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<em><strong>Lafayette Engagement and Research Network (LEaRN)</strong>:</em> This Lafayette, La., project proposes a partnership between collegiate, local government and non-governmental organizations to deploy a network of sensors. The project has a strong data management plan that will use a scalable cloud platform. They plan to use commercially-available sensors for the project and share the data with the public in a variety of ways.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  EPA is recognizing these four projects for honorable mention because of their innovation and potential to help other communities:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong><em>Healthy Mesa County &amp; Mesa County Health Department: Smart City Air Challenge Solution</em></strong>: Mesa, Colo.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong><em>Air Quality Crowdsourcing Data in Minneapolis/St. Paul</em></strong>: Minneapolis/St. Paul&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong><em>New York City Air Casting Project: EPA Smart City Air Challenge Solution</em></strong>: New York&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong><em>Citizen science with Ground-Level Ozone Wearables Sensors (GLOWS) for real-time pollution maps across the Research Triangle</em></strong>: Research Triangle, N.C.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Although the challenge is closed, EPA will be available as a resource to the winners and honorable mention project teams to share knowledge about how they collect, store and manage large amounts of data. EPA encourages these communities and others to share their findings so other communities can learn from their successes, challenges and lessons.    &lt;hr /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a chance for communities to demonstrate their leadership in managing hundreds of air quality sensors at the local level.    EPA is challenging communities across the country to collect data using hundreds of air quality sensors as part of the Smart City Air Challenge. The agency is offering up to $40,000 apiece to two communities to help them develop and implement plans for collecting and sharing data from air quality sensors.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  To qualify for the challenge, communities will need to submit plans for deploying hundreds of air quality sensors and managing the data they collect. EPA will award up to $40,000 apiece to up to two communities that have the best data collection strategies, including their plans to share their data management methods with other communities. The award money only covers part of the program costs, so communities will need to partner with sensor manufacturers, data management companies or others to get resources and expertise to implement their plans.    - <strong>See EPA’s <a href="https://developer.epa.gov/smart-city-air-challenge-resource-pages/">challenge resource pages</a></strong> about air quality sensors, data management and more.    - <strong>Attend <a href="https://developer.epa.gov/smart-city-air-challenge-webinar-series/">webinars about the challenge</a></strong>.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  After a year, EPA will evaluate the two projects and award up to an additional $10,000 to the winning communities based on their accomplishments and collaboration.    The challenge is open from August 30, 2016 to October 28, 2016. Through the challenge, communities have the opportunity to adopt the paradigm of big data, citizen science, and the Internet of Things as they address air quality problems that are relevant to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   The challenge is designed to inspire communities to discover new approaches to managing data for air topics they care about, then develop solutions and share them. It is experimental in nature and EPA expects to learn how communities handle data from many sensors. The challenge prize funds are meant to be seed money, not the full amount for procuring sensors and data management services. EPA is ready to provide background information through <a href="https://developer.epa.gov/smart-city-air-challenge-resource-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resource Pages</a> that list EPA’s research and similar experiences in other communities, <a href="https://developer.epa.gov/smart-city-air-challenge-webinar-series/">webinars about the challenge</a> and a <a href="https://developer.epa.gov/frequently-asked-questions/">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  EPA prefers that the sensors and the resulting data are of good quality. Although standards exist for measuring criteria pollutants (see Designated EPA Reference and Equivalent Methods at <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/amtic/criteria.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/amtic/criteria.html</a>), there are no standards for measuring air quality for non-regulatory or non-enforcement purposes. For the challenge, communities will need to describe the level of accuracy, precision and reliability of the sensors and how they will ensure these attributes. The data from these projects will belong to the projects and will be available for others to use. EPA recommends that communities carefully evaluate the quality of sensors and the associated data. Please refer to the sensor resource page to learn more about independent sensor testing by EPA and others.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The challenge encourages communities to create solutions and identify best practices that other communities can adopt and benefit from. In doing so, they will advance the theme of Information Technology Infrastructure and New Data Streams, as mentioned in EPA’s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-09/documents/roadmap-20130308.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Draft Roadmap for Next Generation of Air Monitoring</a>. Through their projects, communities will help each other and EPA “face challenges presented by the ever increasing amounts of sensor-generated data, the analytics needed to translate data into knowledge, and how to make sensor data available for discovery and integration with data from other allied disciplines.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  EPA expects the challenge to yield several benefits, such as identifying best practices for managing big data at the community level, how to engage citizens in collecting data about their community, and how to use data from many sensors to understand environmental condition and its relationship to human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    <strong>Constraints</strong><br />  Submissions will be judged based on the constraints and performance criteria outlined below. Before being scored against weighted performance criteria, entries must meet the four constraints listed below. Submissions that do not meet the constraints must describe their justification for doing so and will receive lower judging scores accordingly.  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong>Deploy 250 to 500 sensors in a community</strong>  Submissions must describe how they will procure and deploy 250 to 500 air quality sensors.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong>Community involvement in purchasing and using the sensors</strong>  The community and its residents will provide funds for the sensors in order to ensure citizen engagement and better data quality.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong>Identification of partners and project sustainability</strong>  EPA will provide prizes to the winning communities. The community and its residents will provide funds and establish partnerships to implement the strategy.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong>Be transparent in terms of making the data open and describing the data management plans</strong>  The data from the sensors will be available for free and in machine-readable form. The data management plan describes how data will be managed in all parts of the information life cycle.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td width="381"&gt;<strong>Constraints</strong>&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td width="97"&gt;<strong>Score Range</strong>&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td width="381"&gt;Deploy 250 to 500 sensors in a community&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td width="97"&gt;Yes or No&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td width="381"&gt;Community involvement in purchasing and using the sensors&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td width="97"&gt;Yes or No&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td width="381"&gt;Identification of partners and project sustainability&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td width="97"&gt;Yes or No&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td width="381"&gt;Be transparent in terms of making the data open and describing the data management plans&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td width="97"&gt;Yes or No&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;  &lt;/table&gt;  See the Judging Criteria for more details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   <strong>Email recipients</strong><br />  Send comments to the Discussion section of this challenge or to smartcityairchallenge@epa.gov.  ALL DECISIONS BY THE EPA ARE FINAL AND BINDING IN ALL MATTERS RELATED TO THE COMPETITION.
