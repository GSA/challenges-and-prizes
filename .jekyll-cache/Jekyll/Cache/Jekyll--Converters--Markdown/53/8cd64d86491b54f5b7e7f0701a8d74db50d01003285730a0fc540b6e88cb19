I"<p>Scientists and engineers need data—from the atomic weight of carbon and the structure of benzene, to the most precise value for the speed of light. High quality physical and chemical reference data help researchers design experiments, build better products, solve health and environmental problems, and even study the stars. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, is a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce. </p>
<p>NIST provides some of the most accurate and comprehensive datasets in the world. Physicists, biochemical engineers, environmental researchers, and many other technically trained experts routinely use NIST Standard Reference Data in their workday. Students from high school through graduate school use the same datasets to master the ropes of scientific discovery. NIST needs help making sure our customers can find and better use our reference data, putting the information in the hands of scientists and engineers. </p>
<p>The eligible NIST datasets for this challenge include chemical and physical datasets that are frequently accessed, and/or data that is related and would be good for mash ups.  Help drive innovation and support research by developing your own mobile applications that use NIST Standard Reference Data!</p>
