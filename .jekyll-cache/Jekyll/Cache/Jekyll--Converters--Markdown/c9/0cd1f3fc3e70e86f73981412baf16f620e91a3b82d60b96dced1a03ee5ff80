I"k<h4><strong>Background</strong></h4>
<p>The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA(ALT)) is announcing the second cohort of the Army Expeditionary Technology Search &ndash; xTechSearch &ndash; to be featured at the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Global Force Meeting in Huntsville, AL, on 26 to 28 March 2019. xTechSearch will highlight opportunities for nontraditional defense partners to collaborate with the Army to tackle the most poignant Army modernization challenges.</p>
<p>The ASA(ALT) recognizes that the Army must enhance engagements with the entrepreneurial funded community, small businesses, and other non-traditional defense partners, by: (1) understanding the spectrum of technologies being developed commercially that may benefit the Army; (2) integrating the sector of nontraditional innovators into the Army&rsquo;s research and development ecosystem; and (3) providing mentorship and expertise to accelerate, mature, and transition technologies of interest to the Army.</p>
<p>The xTechSearch program will provide resourcing to select businesses to demonstrate proof of concept for their technologies pertaining to Army challenges.&nbsp; The program will also integrate these nontraditional innovators into the Army&rsquo;s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) ecosystem by providing cooperative research opportunities with Army labs, including access to the Army&rsquo;s organic intellectual and technical capital.&nbsp; xTechSearch is an opportunity for businesses to pitch novel technology solutions &ndash; a new application for an existing technology or a new technology concept entirely &ndash; to the Army.&nbsp; The Army will provide non-dilutive seed prizes for the companies to demonstrate proof of concept in an Army-relevant challenge area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Technology Focus Areas</strong></h4>
<p>xTechSearch seeks novel, disruptive concepts and technologies to support the following Army technology focus areas:</p>
<p><strong>Long Range Precision Fires</strong>.
