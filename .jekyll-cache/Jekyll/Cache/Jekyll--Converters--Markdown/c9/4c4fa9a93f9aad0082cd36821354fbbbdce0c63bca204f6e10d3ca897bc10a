<p><strong>UPDATE - 3/11/2016 - SBA is pleased to announce the five winners of the Lean for Main Street Training Challenge. Please see the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/content/sba-announces-winners-lean-main-street-training-challenge-0" target="_blank">press release</a> for winner information. <br />Thank you to all applicants!</strong>     <strong>&lt;/p&gt;<p><em>Note: This challenge is limited only to entities that are currently part of SBA’s Resource Partner Network, i.e. entities that receive SBA funding to operate Small Business Development Centers (both lead and service centers are eligible), Women’s Business Centers, Veteran's Business Outreach Centers, and SCORE Chapters. Please see the Rules section for more information, or contact leanchallenge@sba.gov with additional questions.</em>&lt;/strong&gt;</p>    <p>Given the success and growing popularity of the National Science Foundation’s I-Corps™ program (see http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/about.jsp), the SBA is interested in the potential for using adapted versions of that program as a means to assist a broader array of small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs operating outside the I-Corps™ program’s current focus on technology-based businesses or commercialization concepts.</p> <p>For reference, the I-Corps™ program involves expert business trainers helping teams of scientists and entrepreneurs apply “lean principles”—a collection of practices and concepts for business model analysis—to those scientists’ and entrepreneurs’ nascent entrepreneurial efforts.</p> <p>Given the SBA’s esteem for the success of this program, the SBA has partnered with the National Science Foundation (NSF) to offer the Lean for Main Street Training Challenge to current SBA Women’s Business Centers, Small Business Development Centers, and SCORE Chapters (“Contestants”).    Contestants selected as winners will participate in the development and deployment of innovative “lean startup” resources that can be delivered to small businesses in sectors or regions that have not had significant exposure or access to these resources. Winning Contestant representatives will participate in an in-person and virtual train-the-trainer  program and forum with I-Corps™ national instructors to develop an innovative framework for exposing lean methodology to businesses in traditional sectors.</p> <p>Winners will then implement these newly-developed lean training resources to businesses in their respective communities on a pilot basis and provide SBA with an assessment of their effectiveness. For more information, please see the Rules section.</p>
