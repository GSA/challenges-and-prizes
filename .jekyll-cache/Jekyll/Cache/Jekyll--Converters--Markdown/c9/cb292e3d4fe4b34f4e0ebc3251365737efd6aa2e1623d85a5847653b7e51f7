I"÷<p>There are numerous alternatives to a Global Positioning System (GPS), such as inertial measurement units, terrain following, star trackers, etc. Each has benefits and limitations and offer varying levels of precision navigation.  This Challenge is seeking innovative non-GPS solutions that can help navigate in any part of the world.   Ideally, a solution will be platform agnostic, allowing for use with any mode of transportation (e.g. person walking, riding in a car or small airplane, etc.).</p>
