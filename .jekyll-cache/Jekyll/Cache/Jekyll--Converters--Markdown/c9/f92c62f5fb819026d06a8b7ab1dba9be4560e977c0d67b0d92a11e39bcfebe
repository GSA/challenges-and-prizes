I"ù<p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety CommissionÂ is sponsoring a nationwide carbonÂ monoxide (CO) safety poster contest to help warnÂ people about the dangers of CO. CO is called the â€œinvisible killerâ€ because you cannot see or smell this poisonous gas.Â Each year, about 400 people die in the United States from unintentional CO poisoning from fuel-burning appliances, such as furnaces, gas ranges, water heaters, portable generators, and charcoal grills, as well as motor vehicles. Â Help stop the â€œinvisible killerâ€ by creating an original poster that warns others about the dangers of carbon monoxide.    Watch our video about the contest-Â <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Newsroom/Multimedia/?vid=70423">Carbon Monoxide Poster Contest Video</a></p>
