<p><strong>About Prize Competitions</strong></p>

<p>U.S. government agencies constantly work to address issues that affect people, communities, and industries throughout the country and even the world. Sometimes, they need help.</p>

<p>Since 2010, the U.S. government has run over 1,200 prize competitions - engaging public solvers ranging from students and hobbyists to small business owners and academic researchers.</p>

<p>Longitude and ship navigation, Lindbergh‚Äôs transatlantic flight, even initial designs for the U.S. Capitol and White House‚Äîall were the result of open prize competitions. More recently, challenges have produced concepts for the next ‚Äúlunar loo‚Äù (space toilet), an improved digital wallet user interface, protecting fish from water infrastructure, opioid detection in international mail, and ‚Äúgetting out the count‚Äù for the census.</p>

<p>And yes, those self-driving vehicles got their start in federal prize competitions too!</p>
