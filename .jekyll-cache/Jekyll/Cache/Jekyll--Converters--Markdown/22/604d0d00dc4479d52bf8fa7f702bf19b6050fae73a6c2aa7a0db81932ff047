I"<p>An average of twenty Veterans die by suicide each day.  In 2014, roughly 67% of all Veteran deaths by suicide were the result of firearm injuries. Statistics for that year also show that about 65% of all Veterans who die by suicide are age 50 or older. Compared to their age-matched civilian peers, both male and female Veterans have an increased risk for suicide. Research suggests that most suicidal crises pass within minutes to hours, and that building in time and space between a suicidal impulse and access to a gun reduces suicide deaths.    In response, the VA Challenge Team has been given the authority to seek solutions through an Innovation Challenge.  The Gun Safety Challenge invites proposals for solutions that offer new options for enhanced safe gun storage to prevent suicide, injury and accidents. Specifically, the VA is seeking cost-effective options for a tangible device or system to be used voluntarily by a Veteran or trusted friend or family member. The device or system must allow for 100% voluntary control (implementation, suspension, decommissioning) by the Veteran. The goal is to provide safe firearm storage within or outside the home. Approaches that address emotional distress or crisis, especially for those individuals who may not have a secondary support system such as family members or friends nearby, or who do not have the means for storing their guns safely are of interest. The desired outcome of this challenge is for ideas of systems or devices that provide enhanced gun safety features or storage.</p>
