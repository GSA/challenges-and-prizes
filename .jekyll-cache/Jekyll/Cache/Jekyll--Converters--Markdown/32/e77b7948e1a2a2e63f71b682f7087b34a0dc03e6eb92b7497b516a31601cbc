I"—<p>To be responsive to this Challenge, a submission should present two proposals:</p>
<ol> <li>A design with initial feasibility data for a diagnostic platform assessing two diseases in the vasculature, one of which must be sickle cell disease, malaria, or anemia.</li> <li>A robust description of the path for translation of the technology to global health use cases, and how the technology will need to develop further to reduce cost and be suitable for field use.</li> </ol>
<p>A strong Challenge submission includes a device design with the following characteristics:</p>
<ul> <li>Technical validity demonstrated by initial feasibility data or references</li> <li>Platform potential:&nbsp; potential to adapt or extend the device to at least two relevant diseases/conditions</li> <li>At least one target disease should be sickle cell disease, malaria, or anemia</li> <li>Measures parameters that could be used to track disease state and/or response to therapy</li> <li>Uses mobile device or portable attachment to a mobile device</li> <li>Non-invasive and does not require blood sampling</li> <li>Low-cost and accessible</li> <li>Self-contained and highly portable; for example, proposed device does not use biological reagents</li> <li>Allows rapid data collection and time to result</li> <li>Integrates prior context about the patient and environment into the test results</li> <li>Scalable to population delivery</li> </ul>
