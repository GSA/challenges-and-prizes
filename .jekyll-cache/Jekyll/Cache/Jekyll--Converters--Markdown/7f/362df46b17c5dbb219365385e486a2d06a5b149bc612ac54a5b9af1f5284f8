Participants will also submit a written description of their model that includes mapping of requirements and capabilities to UAF views, along with a list of supporting physics-based relationships and assumptions.&nbsp; Within the written description, participants must also address questions about compliance with </span><span lang="EN">Federal Acquisition Regulation and Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement requirements and provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for the cost to develop the proposed payload and for the cost to produce the payload on a per unit basis.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span lang="EN">The Government intends to award the prizes to the proposals that comply with the requirements of the prize challenge and, all factors considered, provide the greatest overall benefit to the Government.</span></p> <p><span lang="EN">A full description of the submission requirements and evaluation criteria can be found at </span><span lang="EN"><a href="http://www.navair.navy.mil/muxchallenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.navair.navy.mil/muxchallenge</a></span><span lang="EN">.&nbsp; If there is a conflict between the information found on this challenge.gov posting and the information contained at </span><span lang="EN"><a href="http://www.navair.navy.mil/muxchallenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.navair.navy.mil/muxchallenge</a></span><span lang="EN">, the information at </span><span lang="EN"><a href="http://www.navair.navy.mil/muxchallenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.navair.navy.mil/muxchallenge</a></span><span lang="EN"> shall govern.</span></p> </div>
