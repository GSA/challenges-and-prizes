<p>The Seekers may award a total prize award pool of $65,000.</p>

<p><strong>Prize Breakdown</strong></p>

<p>The minimum full award amount is $10,000. The Seeker can allocate higher individual award amounts, as deemed appropriate. The Challenge award will be contingent upon results of critical analysis and evaluation by the Seekers and the Judging Panel appointed by the Seekers. Meeting the Technical Requirements does not guarantee that the proposed solution will receive an award from the Seekers. Partial cash prizes may be considered for solutions that meet some, but not all, of the criteria.</p>

<p>Finalists will be invited to present their technologies at a showcasing event (date and location to be determined). Promising submissions may also be advanced to greenhouse or field testing at the conclusion of the competition.</p>
