I"R<div class="panel-body">    DISCLAIMER: The following is a FICTITIOUS story meant for providing realistic context for the 2016 Codebreaker Challenge and is not tied in any way to actual events.    Terrorists have recently developed a new type of remotely controlled Improvised Explosive Device (IED), making it harder for the U.S. Armed Forces to detect and ultimately prevent roadside bomb attacks against troops deployed overseas. The National Security Agency (NSA), in accordance with its support to military operations mission, has been asked to develop capabilities for use against this new threat. This will consist of six tasks of increasing difficulty, with the ultimate goals of being able to disarm the IEDs remotely and permanently render them inoperable without the risk of civilian casualties.    Are YOU up to the challenge?!    </div>
