I"»<p><strong>Required Data Set: Â </strong>    Visualizations must make use of at least one data set available through the <a href="http://www.waterqualitydata.us/">Water Quality Portal</a>:  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;The Water Quality Portal (WQP) is a cooperative service sponsored by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), and the National Water Quality Monitoring Council (NWQMC). It serves data collected by over 400 state, federal, tribal, and local agencies.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Â     <strong>Additional Data Sets</strong>    Solvers may, at their discretion, use alternative publically available open data sets (both governmental and non-governmental) and/or open APIs in conjunction with one or more data sets from the Water Quality Portal to reveal insights, trends, and relationships.Â  Examples can be found in the attachment to this Challenge.    Â     <strong>Submission Requirements</strong>    A range of media will be accepted including interactive web apps, graphic images, motion graphics, video, or combinations thereof.Â  Note that if you do create an interactive app (JavaScript, Flash, etc.), it must be functional in a normal browser environment (current versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox) and you must host it on your own site during the judging phase of the Challenge. In addition, visualizations must not rely on proprietary software packages for display, any software developed that is necessary for the visualization must be included in your submission, including source code.    Submissions must also include a text document with: 1) a description of the intended impact of the work (including but not limited to: variable relationships, context and how it relates to the â€˜storyâ€™), and 2) citations of data sources. See <a href="http://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/faq/miscellaneous/how-to-cite-usgs-water-data-for-the-nation-waterdata.usgs.gov-in-a-publication">USGS NWIS</a> for an example of how to cite data; use this template as a form for indicating the source of data used. Citing your data sources is an essential step in the scientific process and will be considered as a factor for judging.    Â     <strong>Judging Criteria</strong>  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Scientific Excellence</strong> â€“ Submissions will be evaluated for scientific credibility of data and use thereof.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Innovation and Data Analytics</strong> â€“ Submissions will be evaluated for novel combination, integration, and application of data analysis. They must be original works but may use existing open applications.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Design</strong> â€“ Submissions will be evaluated for visually appealing, creative, and intuitive interface. They should be eye catching while also a clear presentation of the data.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Storytelling</strong> â€“ Submissions will be evaluated for communicating a persuasive, meaningful, accurate, and engaging message that is relevant across a broad viewership to inform and drive action. If the visualization is watershed, event or variable specific it should have meaning, application, and impact to other communities as well.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Â     This Challenge requires a <strong>data visualization </strong>and <strong>written description</strong> to be submitted. There are two awards for this Challenge:  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>First Place Award</strong> â€“ $10,000; An opportunity to attend the Nutrient Sensor Challenge Summit on August 12, 2015 to present the winning visualization; Visualization promoted on USGS, US EPA, and Blue Legacy International websites; Substantive blog post by Alexandra Cousteau with reference to visualization on National Geographic Water Currents Blog and Huffington Post Green&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Peopleâ€™s Choice Award</strong> â€“ $5,000; Visualization promoted on USGS, US EPA, and Blue Legacy International websites; Substantive blog post by Alexandra Cousteau with reference to Visualization on National Geographic Water Currents Blog and Huffington Post Green&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>In Addition</strong>, the top 10 visualizations, including the First Place Award and Peopleâ€™s Choice Award winners, will have the opportunity to be promoted on the federal interagency <a href="http://acwi.gov/spatial/owdi/">Open Water Data Initiative</a> website&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  The winner of the First Place Award will be determined by a judging panel convened by the Seekers. The winner of the Peopleâ€™s Choice Award will be determined by online voting for the top 9 remaining visualizations as determined by the judging panel (First Place Award winner not eligible for the Peopleâ€™s Choice Award.) By making a submission to this Challenge, you are granting the Seekers permission to make your submission available to the public after the Challenge deadline for the sole purpose of voting for the Peopleâ€™s Choice Award winner. In addition, you are providing consent to the Seekers to publicly disclose your identity if your Proposed Solution is chosen for an award and you choose to accept the award.    <strong>Please do not attempt to contact judges in any way.
