I"<p>The third annual HUD Innovation in Affordable Housing Student Design and Planning Competition challenges multi-disciplinary, graduate student teams to respond to a real life affordable housing design and planning issue. The competition is sponsored by HUD’s Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&amp;R). PD&amp;R partners with a public housing authority to create a real scenario which will be the focus of the students' plans. This year's scenario focuses on affordable family housing.</p>
<p>Multidisciplinary teams must be comprised of a minimum of three students and a maximum of five, plus one faculty advisor. Each team must have members representing three different graduate level programs; one of which must be from an architectural or design-related program, and one of which must be from a non-architectural program. There are many acceptable permutations; here is one <strong>example</strong> for clarity:</p>
