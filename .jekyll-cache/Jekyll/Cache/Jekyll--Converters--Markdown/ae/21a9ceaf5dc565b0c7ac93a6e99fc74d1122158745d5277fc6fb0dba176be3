<!-- Description start -->
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<div class="description">
<p>Full ocean depths (nominally 6000m) and long-term exposure to seawater create great challenges in the undersea environment. These challenges restrict the design and capability of weapons, electronics and vehicles both manned and unmanned.</p>
<p>The goal of this prize challenge is to seek solutions or technology to:</p>
<p>Design and construct a body/payload section that will survive full ocean depth pressures (6000m/10,000psi). The body/section shall be cylindrical with at least one removable/reusable end cap, approximately 21‚Äù in length, nominal outer diameter of 5.125‚Äù with maximized payload volume, and shall be scalable to diameters from 4‚Äù to 60‚Äù.</p>

<!-- Rules start -->
<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>

<div class="rules">
<h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p>These terms and conditions apply to all participants in the Challenge.</p> 
<p>Agreement to Terms. By responding to this announcement, the participant agrees to comply with and be bound by the rules (including these terms and conditions) of this prize challenge and the decisions of the Government, which rules and decisions are binding and final in all matters relating to this challenge.</p>
<p>Security Requirements. By responding to this announcement, the participant agrees to comply with the DoDM 5200.01 (all volumes) and any revisions to this manual.</p>
<p>Participation by Government Support Contractors. Government support contractors will assist in the review of any data provided by participants. A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) has been signed by the support contractors with the Government that precludes them from disclosing any proprietary data outside of the Government. If participants desire a separate NDA with the Government support contractors, participants should submit a NDA form, along with instructions, with their initial qualification application.</p> 
<p>Other Transaction Authority (OTA). At the Government‚Äôs discretion, the Government may choose to award an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) award (under 10 U.S. Code, Section 2371 or 2371b) under these authorities to any chosen participant in this prize challenge. In the case of an award under 10 U.S. Code, Section 2371b, a successful prototype project may result in the further award of a follow-on OTA without additional competition. The case of an award under any of the authorities mentioned, significant quantities may be needed for field-testing.</p> 
<p>NOTE: The Government may negotiate Government Purpose Rights when requesting proposals if an Other Transaction Authority award is contemplated.</p>
<p>Malware. Each participant warrants that the submission is virus free and free of malware.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property (IP) Rights. All data submitted under the Prize Challenge will be made available to NAVSEA and parties authorized to act on behalf of the NAVSEA. By accepting these Terms and Conditions, the Participant consents to the use of data submitted to NAVSEA. Any materials submitted to NAVSEA as part of a prize challenge submission become NAVSEA records and will not be returned.</p>
<p>The use of protective markings such as ‚ÄúDo Not Publicly Release ‚Äì Trade Secret‚Äù or ‚ÄúDo Not Publicly Release ‚Äì Confidential Proprietary Business Information‚Äù in the Header or Footer of the Submission is strongly encouraged where appropriate.  However, Participants should be aware that the use of protective markings is not dispositive as to whether information will be released publicly pursuant to a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act, (FOIA) 5 U.S.C. ¬ß552, et. seq., as amended by the OPEN Government Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110-175. Any information received from the Participant is considered to be a federal agency record, and as such, subject to public release under FOIA.  Decisions to disclose or withhold information received from a Participant are based on the applicability of one or more of the nine FOIA exemptions, not on the existence or nonexistence of protective markings.  Only the agency‚Äôs designated FOIA Officer may determine if information sought under a FOIA request will be withheld pursuant to one or more of the nine FOIA exemptions. All FOIA requests received by NAVSEA are processed in accordance with 10 C.F.R. Part 1004.  Participants will be notified of any FOIA requests for their submissions in accordance with 29 C.F.R. ¬ß 70.26.

  <p>The virtual proof of life check of the Minimum Viable Product shall be presented to the Navy experts. The virtual presentation shall present a preliminary concept/design.</p>
  <p><strong>Phase III: </strong>The offeror shall be evaluated based on the below demonstration criteria:</p> 
<ul>
  <li>Withstanding 10,000 psi Depth Pressure: The pressure test cycle will be 10 cycles to 10,000 psi, holding for 5 min each cycle until the last cycle holds for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Length: The payload section should be approximately 21 inches.</li>
<li>Nominal Outer Diameter (OD): Nominal OD measure to be 5.125 inches.</li> 
<li>Minimum Inner Diameter (ID):  Minimum ID measured to be at least 4 inches, with larger ID‚Äôs successfully pressure tested scoring higher.</li>
<li>Endcap(s):  The internal design space shall be accessible through removable/reusable endcap(s) after successful pressure test is complete.</li>
<li>Potential Scalability to Larger Diameters: Proposal should demonstrate that design/fabrication approach provides potential scalability to larger diameter shells.</li>
<li>Factor of safety: Design factor of safety will be considered in evaluation.</li>
  </ul>
