<p><strong>-----</strong></p>
<p>This multi-phase prize challenge will be conducted during the period of 27 September 2019 through 31 January 2020.&nbsp; During Phase-1 of the challenge, the Government sponsor will review applications and white papers to select Phase-2 invitees. Phase-2 will involve a fly-off competition during the week of 27 January 2020 in Yuma, Arizona.&nbsp; This fly-off will help to evaluate the state-of-the-art in relevant technologies, inform future acquisition strategies, and satisfy merit-based competition for potential Other Transaction (OT) awards for prototyping and procurement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Invited participants who compete in the Phase-2 Fly-Off will receive a monetary award of $10,000 to help defray the costs of participation.&nbsp; Additionally, three cash prizes will be awarded at the completion of the Fly-Off to the winners selected by the Government sponsor:&nbsp; $100,000 for first place, $75,000 for second place, and $50,000 for third place.</p>
<p>Prize challenge participants will be required to demonstrate ground set-up and flight preparation procedures for their UAS, perform a refueling/battery replacement demonstration, and perform up to three autonomous flights.&nbsp; During the first flight, participating air vehicles must transport their maximum payload via GPS waypoints to a landing site 5km away, detach the cargo (either manually or automatically), then return to the original launch site.&nbsp; During the second flight, participating air vehicles must fly with a Government provided plastic water-filled 5-gallon jerrycan over a closed course to demonstrate the maximum range of the vehicle.&nbsp; Participants will be given the opportunity to perform an optional ungraded third flight to demonstrate unique features or capabilities. The air vehicle must complete each flight without refueling or recharging.</p>
<p>Winners will be determined by the Government using a best value approach, which includes evaluation of the application white papers, the Fly-Off Rubric score, and the estimated single unit production cost of participating air vehicles.&nbsp; The Fly-Off Rubric will be provided to competitors along with their Phase-2 Fly-Off invitation package.</p>
