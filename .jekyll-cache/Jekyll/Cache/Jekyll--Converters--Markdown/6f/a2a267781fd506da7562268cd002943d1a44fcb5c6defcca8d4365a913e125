I"‡<h4 id="judging-panel">Judging Panel:</h4>

<p>A judging panel will consist of DHS S&amp;T and other Federal partner representatives. The representatives are from DHS S&amp;T Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, United States Customs and Border Protection, United States Department of Education, and United States Department of State.</p>

<h4 id="judging-criteria">Judging Criteria:</h4>

<p>This Challenge is for a better design for a trusted UI for digital wallets that support the (1) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Verifiable Credential (VC) Data Model</a> and (2) <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DID) standards/specifications</a>.</p>

<p>Reference:  The Digital Wallet work that DHS is currently utilizing is using standards and specifications that are incubated at the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>, the global standards development organization that has defined and manages many of the standards used by internet technologies.</p>

<p>As such, it is expected that entrants to the Challenge will engage with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">W3C Credential Community Group (CCG)</a> to ensure that their proposed designs support W3C standards based Digital Wallet implementations. 
Note:  Reference to the W3C VC Data Model and DID standards/specifications is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by the U.S. government.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 1</strong>: includes an application review and judging period. Up to three (3) finalists will be selected and receive $5,000 each.</p>

<p>Each entry will be based on whether UI is easy-to-use, visual consistency, while supporting interoperability, security, and privacy best practices.</p>

<p>Stage 1 will be judged on the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The completeness of the interactions flows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Obtaining/Signing up for a Digital Wallet from a wallet provider</li>
      <li>Interacting with an Issuer to obtain a W3C Verifiable Credential i.e., interacting with USCIS to obtain a <a href="https://digitalbazaar.github.io/citizenship-vocab/">Digital Permanent Resident Card</a></li>
      <li>Interacting with a second Issuer to obtain another W3C Verifiable Credential i.e., interacting with a University to obtain a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-examples/edu/university-degree-verifiable-credential.json">Digital University Degree Credential</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interacting with a Verifier to present one or more of the W3C Verifiable Credentials in the Wallet that highlights the following capabilities</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Consent management for credential release</li>
      <li>Selective disclosure of a credential</li>
      <li>Presenting multiple credentials if requested by the verifier</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>W3C VC and DID standards/specification support for the interaction flows</li>
  <li>Visual consistency across web and mobile modalities</li>
  <li>Use of color and typography to enhance understanding and provide feedback to user</li>
  <li>Support for widely accepted web and mobile design standards</li>
  <li>Intellectual Property Release that allows for sharing/reuse/remix of the work by the community</li>
</ul>

<p>Stage 1 finalists will be announced and participate in an outreach event hosted by DHS S&amp;T. At this event, the finalists will explain their designs and interact with standards bodies, DHS Components, and other potential U.S. government customers. The event will be virtual and feature discussions with the government community and W3C Group. The discussions will provide the finalists domain expertise and insight into application integration and standards-based digital wallet implementations.  The event is planned to take place in October. DHS S&amp;T will be in contact with Stage 1 finalists on announcement and event dates.</p>

<p>Note:  The event will be open to the public and does not constitute an endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by the U.S. government of any entity or individual in attendance.</p>

<p>Selected Stage 1 finalists should continue to work with the W3C CCG membership to receive their feedback on their designs and the technical constraints that should be considered to further refine their work as they advance to Stage 2 of the Challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 2</strong>: includes an evaluation and a judging process and one (1) grand prize winner will be awarded an additional $10,000 based on the best design solution.</p>

<p>Stage 2 will be judged on the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All criteria used for Stage 1 judging</li>
  <li>The ease of use in independently implementing the UI and UX using the design artifacts provided as part of the Stage 2 submission</li>
</ul>

<p>The grand-prize winner will be awarded an additional $10,000 and publicly announced.</p>

<p>Contestantsâ€™ scores and ranks will be based on the evaluation criteria described in this announcement and also posted on the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/prize-competitions">DHS S&amp;T Prize Competition website</a>.</p>

<p>Stage 1 finalists and Stage 2 grand prize winner of this Challenge will be determined solely by the judging panelâ€™s ranking (subject to compliance with the Challenge rules, terms and conditions).</p>
