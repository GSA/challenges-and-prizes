I"å<h3><strong><u>Eligibility</u>:</strong></h3>
<p>To compete in the Campus RainWorks Challenge,¬†each student team must be affiliated with a degree-granting public or private institution of higher education located in the U.S. and¬†sponsored by a ¬†faculty advisor. All team members must be enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate degree program¬†at an eligible college or university as of August 31, 2016.  &lt;h3&gt;<strong><u>Submission Categories</u>:</strong>&lt;/h3&gt;  To encourage participating teams to assess the environmental, economic, and social benefits of green infrastructure at a range of spatial scales, EPA is accepting submissions in two design categories: a Demonstration Project category and a Master Plan category.  &lt;h4&gt;<strong>Demonstration Project Category</strong>&lt;/h4&gt;  For submissions in the Demonstration Project category, EPA is seeking proof-of-concept level designs that examine how green infrastructure could be integrated into a particular site on the team‚Äôs campus to meet multiple environmental, educational, and economic objectives. Entries in this category should include detailed information on the design and performance of the proposed demonstration project, and should reflect extensive consultation with the facilities planning department to assess project feasibility.  &lt;h4&gt;<strong>Master Plan Category</strong>&lt;/h4&gt;  For submissions in the Master Plan category, EPA is seeking conceptual designs that examine how green infrastructure could be integrated into a broad area of the team‚Äôs campus. Entries in this category should be coordinated with existing campus master plans and should describe how green infrastructure could be used to enhance the long-term sustainability of the campus.  &lt;h4&gt;<strong>For Both Categories</strong>&lt;/h4&gt;  This year‚Äôs competition asks student teams to incorporate climate resiliency considerations into their stormwater management designs. For both submission categories, teams should examine and describe the current and/or potential impacts of climate change on their college or university communities. Entries should qualitatively and/or quantitatively demonstrate how the predicted performance of the team‚Äôs proposed green infrastructure project can mitigate and build resiliency to those impacts while effectively managing stormwater runoff (e.g., manage localized flooding, prepare for drought, reduce or eliminate irrigation, reduce urban heat impacts, lower energy demands).  &lt;h5&gt;<strong>Submission Requirements  </strong>&lt;/h5&gt;  To compete in EPA‚Äôs Campus RainWorks Challenge, registered teams must submit the following which describe an innovative green infrastructure project for a location on their campus:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;One (1) Project Narrative,&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Two (2) Design Boards, and&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;One (1) Letter of Support&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Submissions should provide information of sufficient quality to enable the judges to evaluate the design. Submissions should describe the overall project goals, project context within the campus or watershed, existing conditions along with the problem to be solved, proposed green infrastructure approaches, and expected outcomes.  &lt;h5&gt;<strong>Project Narrative</strong>&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The intent of the Project Narrative is to provide a summary of each team‚Äôs approach to addressing the challenge criteria (see Judging section).&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Each team must prepare a Project Narrative not exceeding ten (10) 8.5‚Äù x 11‚Äù pages (including images, graphics, and tables; excluding cover page, abstract, and an additional allowance of two pages for calculations and references only). Note that pages in excess of ten will not be reviewed. Pages should be consecutively numbered with 1‚Äù margins, and text should be single-spaced in standard 12-point font. Headings may be larger than 12-point font; text labels for graphics or images may be smaller than 12-point font; page numbers may be outside of the 1‚Äù margin.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The Project Narrative must include a cover page (including registration number, project title, first and last names and disciplines of team members, and name and discipline of faculty advisor) and a project abstract (250 word maximum).&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Teams must provide 1 electronic copy of the Project Narrative in Adobe Acrobat¬Æ PDF format. Instructions on submitting deliverables are provided below.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;h5&gt;<strong>Two Design Boards</strong>&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The intent of the Design Boards is to provide a visual explanation of the site context, design elements, and design performance.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The design boards must focus on visual elements and limit the amount of excess text. The design boards should supplement, not duplicate, graphics within the Project Narrative.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Each team must prepare two 24‚Äù x 36‚Äù design boards. Each board must include the team‚Äôs registration number (see Registration section) in the upper right hand corner.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The design boards must include a site plan. Additional elements might include cross sections, conceptual drawing(s), or graphics representing anticipated benefits.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Teams must provide electronic copies of each design board in Adobe Acrobat¬Æ PDF format. Instructions on submitting deliverables are provided below.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;h5&gt;<strong>Letter of support</strong>&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The intent of the letter of support is to demonstrate consultation with the college or university‚Äôs facilities planning department to develop a feasible design.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The letter of support does not count against the ten (10) page limit of the Project Narrative.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Each team must submit a letter from a member of the college or university‚Äôs facilities planning department demonstrating support for the proposed design. Letters of support are not to exceed two 8.5‚Äù by 11‚Äù pages. Note that pages in excess of two will not be reviewed.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The letter of support must be on appropriate letterhead, must be signed by a member of the facilities planning department, and must include the registration number and project title.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Letters of Support must be provided in Adobe Acrobat PDF format. Instructions on submitting project files are provided below.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  For complete eligibility requirements and rules, please visit the Campus RainWorks Challenge website to read the competition brief: http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/greeninfrastructure/crw_challenge.cfm</p>
