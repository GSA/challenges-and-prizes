I"¬<p>Potential Participants are invited to visit the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/tpo/peer">Challenge Website</a>. The Challenge Website provides background information on the persistent challenge of non-compliance with Bayh-Dole reporting requirements. 
To enter, submit your solution addressing novel, effective ways to incentivize recipients of federal R&amp;D funds to comply with the data submission requirements of the Bayh-Dole Act to <a href="mailto:NISTpeerprize@nist.gov">NISTpeerprize@nist.gov</a>.</p>

<p>Submissions should:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Contain an introductory written section summarizing the submission and how it meets the judging criteria;</li>
  <li>Introduce solution or solutions that are implementable to incentivize recipients of federal R&amp;D funds to comply with Bayh-Dole reporting requirements,</li>
  <li>Indicate how the solution(s) will measurably increase Bayh-Dole reporting and propose methods for measuring the impact of the proposed solution(s).</li>
</ol>

<p>Submissions may include, but are not limited, to any one or combination of the following: research papers, essays, promotional material, slideshows, music, videos, mobile or web apps, and other multimedia projects. Concepts or prototypes are encouraged.</p>

<p>Eligible formats must be in commonly accessible forms such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Word</li>
  <li>PDF</li>
  <li>Powerpoint</li>
  <li>Excel</li>
  <li>Movie (.mov file)</li>
  <li>Audio (.mp3 file)</li>
</ul>

<p>Multimedia submissions may also be submitted by providing a link to an online platform (youtube, vimeo, google play store, website, etc.) as part of your submission if the content is made freely accessible to NIST for evaluation and judging.</p>

<p>Submissions should convey a clear understanding of the problem and how the solution(s) will measurably increase Bayh-Dole reporting compliance. Participants should also take into account the cost-benefit of a proposed solution. Practical, effective solutions are the key to success for this Challenge.</p>

<p>Problem areas in meeting Bayh-Dole reporting requirements that your solution might address include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Difficulty of educating and reaching all scientists, engineers, researchers, and other relevant employees on the Bayh-Dole reporting requirements;</li>
  <li>Challenge of obtaining timely disclosures and other IP-related actions on technologies subject to Bayh-Dole reporting requirements from researchers and other relevant employees;</li>
  <li>Difficulty convincing organization leadership to commit necessary attention and resource to meet the needs to fulfill Bayh-Dole reporting requirements;</li>
  <li>Obstacles preventing coordination between different business units within an organization and preventing accurate and timely reporting, e.g. university technology transfer, grants management, and other administrative offices;</li>
  <li>Difficulty tracking all publications and public disclosures relating to IP, in turn contributing to less accurate reporting to federal agencies; and</li>
  <li>Obstacles to creating and maintaining an informed and responsive management and customer service operation to support Bayh-Dole compliance; or</li>
  <li>Other ideas.</li>
</ul>
