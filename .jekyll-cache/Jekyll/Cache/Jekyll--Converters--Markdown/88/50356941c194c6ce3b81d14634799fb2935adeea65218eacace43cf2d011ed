The best concepts will be effective, affordable, and hold the potential for wide adoption by recreational mariners and boaters. Submitted concepts may be for a new or updated lifejacket or personal floatation device (PFD), an attachment to a lifejacket/PFD, or something recreational mariners and boaters use in addition to wearing their lifejacket/PFD.</p>

Within this mission, one critical challenge is finding people who are lost in the water.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #555555; font-family: proxima-nova-n6, proxima-nova, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">When a person falls off of a recreational watercraft (boat, kayak, Jet Ski, paddle craft, etc.), they can be left isolated in open waters. A life jacket or personal floatation device (PFD) is a must for survival, keeping a person afloat while they wait for rescue. But a person lost in the water is a small, moving target and it can sometimes take hours before rescue teams are able to locate them.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #555555; font-family: proxima-nova-n6, proxima-nova, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">New recreational mariner safety solutions have the potential to greatly improve the chances of a successful rescue. Current technologies such as dyes, personal locators, and reflective materials in lifejackets/PFDs can help the U.S. Coast Guard better find people, and are shown to improve rescue rates. However, adoption of these technologies remains low, due to factors like cost, comfort, style, and awareness.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #555555; font-family: proxima-nova-n6, proxima-nova, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">With the U.S. Coast Guard Ready For Rescue Challenge, the USCG and DHS S&amp;T calls upon innovators from a wide variety of fields&mdash; from Public Safety, Maritime Safety, Recreational Sports, Consumer Goods and Materials, Wearables, Textiles, Smart Technologies, and the Internet of Things&mdash; to develop concepts for a new or updated lifejacket/PFD, attachment to a lifejacket/PFD or something recreational mariners and boaters use in addition to wearing their lifejacket/PFD that will enable search and rescue personnel to more readily find and rescue a person in the water. The USCG and DHS S&amp;T intends for this work to be the first step in the design of new, improved or adapted technologies that can be leveraged by current USCG Search and Rescue assets to locate and rescue a person in the water faster.</p>

<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #555555; font-family: proxima-nova-n6, proxima-nova, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Phase I (Ideation/Concept): September 5, 2018-October 15, 2018</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #555555; font-family: proxima-nova-n6, proxima-nova, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Phase II (Prototype Development): By invitation only. Phase I winners and honorable mentions participate in a &ldquo;piranha pool&rdquo;. Date(s) to be announced within 30 days of completion of Phase I.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #555555; font-family: proxima-nova-n6, proxima-nova, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Phase III (Prototype Assessment in an Operational Scenario): By invitation only. DHS S&amp;T and the USCG will announce an open submission period for additional Phase III participants in the Spring of 2019. Phase III participants include Phase II participants and invited open submission period applicants.</p>

<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #555555; font-family: proxima-nova-n6, proxima-nova, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Phase I of the Challenge seeks concepts for novel and scalable solutions that help make people lost in the water easier to find and rescue. Solutions should help to improve the success of the search and rescue mission and may be a new or updated lifejacket/PFD, an attachment to a lifejacket/PFD, or something recreational mariners and boaters use in addition to wearing their lifejacket/PFD. Proposed solutions must work with at least one existing USCG asset, including the human eye, personal locators, audio, homing beacons, wave infrared, GPS, X Band Radar, near infrared, and other sensor mechanisms. A full list of USCG assets and additional reading and resources can be found at http://readyforrescuechallenge.com. Solutions should not discourage recreational mariners and boaters from purchasing or wearing a lifejacket/PFD or give the impression that it is a substitute for wearing a lifejacket/PFD. Note that solutions cannot include a signal flare or pyrotechnic device.</p>

Phase I monetary awards are anticipated to be distributed based on the review of the Phase I submissions by the judges. In addition to the monetary prize awards, up to five (5) honorable mention award winners will be selected by the judges and invited to participate in Phase II of the Challenge. Phase I monetary prize winners will be required to participate in Phase II to be eligible for the Phase I monetary award. Honorable mention non-monetary award winners will be invited, but not be required, to participate in Phase II. All Phase II participants are eligible to receive a monetary and/or non-monetary prize based on their participation and the judging criteria defined below.</p>

(See Phase II information below). The DHS S&amp;T Directorate will provide invitational travel for Phase I monetary award winners to travel from their home of record (within the Continental U.S. Alaska, and Hawaii) to New London, CT and return. In the case of a team entry, the Team Lead will receive invitational travel to the &ldquo;Piranha Pool&rdquo; pitch.</p>

<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #555555; font-family: proxima-nova-n6, proxima-nova, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Phase I monetary prize winners and invited non-monetary honorable mentions (optional) will participate in a &ldquo;Piranha Pool&rdquo; to pitch their concept, prototype build and evaluation plan before a panel of judges comprised of the public and private maritime community. Participants will compete for a cash prize purse of up to $120,000 to assist in the development of their concept into a working prototype for evaluation, testing alongside USCG assets, and judging in Phase III. &nbsp;Additionally, all Phase II monetary award and non-monetary award winners may be offered access to additional non-monetary awards consisting of USCG resources, data and mentorship. Based on a winner&rsquo;s acceptance of Phase II non-monetary support, a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement and/or background check may be required to access certain USCG resources. Phase II monetary awards and offers of non-monetary awards to assist in the development of a working prototype will be distributed by the judges based upon the &ldquo;Piranha Pool&rdquo; presentation, posed questions and answers.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #555555; font-family: proxima-nova-n6, proxima-nova, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Phase III will be conducted between 1 August 2019 and 31 December 2019. Phase III will consist of limited field testing of prototypes alongside standard USCG approved safety equipment. The test location will be in the Northeast U.S. in August 2019 (test dates to be announced). Prior to the beginning of Phase III, the USCG and DHS S&amp;T will open Phase III to a limited number of additional contestants that did not participate in Phase I or II. New entries will be evaluated by a panel of judges based on their uniqueness, potential effectiveness and feasibility based on the criteria described in Phase I of this challenge. At the sole discretion of the judges, a limited number of new contestants with a working prototype may be invited to participate in Phase III.&nbsp; All Phase III contestants will be eligible to share in the Phase III prize purse of up to $110,000.</p>
