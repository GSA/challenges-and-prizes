<p>Lithium batteries‚Äô benefits of increased capabilities at a reduced weight outweigh their inherent risks in many industrial, commercial and some military applications. However, these benefits do not outweigh the inherent risk of transporting the batteries. For example, most commercial passenger airlines do not allow lithium batteries to be packed inside checked luggage due to the inherent fire hazard in a cargo hold, which represents an unacceptable risk. Likewise, military (and other users) transportation of lithium batteries represents risks that are also sometimes unacceptable. A solution that develops a containment system to carry batteries that suitably mitigates the inherent hazards is desired to allow more applications, commercial and military, to benefit from the use of rechargeable (called ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù) and non-rechargeable (called ‚Äúprimary‚Äù) lithium batteries.</p>

<p>The objective for this Lithium Battery Man Portable Containment Challenge is to demonstrate a method to transport military-qualified lithium primary and secondary batteries that mitigates hazards generated during a thermal runaway event. Since some lithium batteries are more reactive than other types, a proposed solution does not have to accommodate all types of current military lithium batteries, but a solution that does accommodate more lithium battery types is more valuable for the purposes of this challenge. Man portable can be defined as a single person carry up to 50 Lbs, which will include up to 12.5 Lbs of batteries. The challenge assumes no battery charging or discharging will occur during transportation of lithium batteries.</p>

<p>Additional threshold parameters include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contain or extinguish all fire and large (greater than 5 micrometers diameter) particulates generated during a thermal runaway event</li>
  <li>Limit and neutralize (reduce combustibility and/or toxicity) all released gases from the container</li>
  <li>Be stackable with secure attachment points for carrying straps, handles, tie-down</li>
  <li>Securely immobilize the contained batteries</li>
  <li>Provide a degree of shock and vibration isolation for the batteries contained</li>
  <li>Provide a degree of water and moisture protection for the batteries contained</li>
  <li>Physical dimension must have a single side that is less than 36‚Äù in circumference and 11.5‚Äù in radius</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional stretch objectives parameters include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be capable of containing all vent gases</li>
  <li>Be capable of reducing the hazards of released toxic vent gases</li>
  <li>Ability to convey externally that a hazardous event has occurred inside the container</li>
  <li>Ability to suppress or extinguish the thermal runaway event internal to the container</li>
  <li>Reduction in physical dimension and/or weight to improve portability</li>
</ul>

<p>The challenge will be completed via a four Phased approach. Phase I objective is to provide a concept ‚Äúwhite paper‚Äù from which a Virtual Presentation of White Paper Concept may be invited. Phase II objective is to design a detailed solution and demonstrate a limited Proof-of-Concept (POC). Phase III objective is to fabricate and demonstrate a Technology Development Prototype. Phase IV will include any potential follow-on award(s). The Government may, at its discretion, award follow-on(s) for the continuous development of the technology development. The Government does not currently have funding for follow-on award(s).</p>

<p>Detailed solution is defined as a technical illustration or Computer aided Design (CAD) model of the proposed solution with consideration to threshold parameters. POC is defined as a small project created to test whether a certain idea or theory about the product can be implemented. Technology Development Prototype is defined as a product that is capable to be tested to successfully demonstrate the ability to meet the challenge objectives.</p>

<p>Phase I objective is to ‚Äúvirtually‚Äù (e.g. via a phone or video conference) present your concept. Phase I will be conducted in two phases: Initial submission of White Paper Concept followed by an invitation to provide a Virtual Presentation of White Paper Concept. The White Paper Concept shall describe in detail the Challenge objectives your solution will address, how your proposed solution would achieve those objectives, how if selected for Phase II you intend to design your solution, what POC will be developed and evaluated and describe your plans for how you would intend for your solution to be manufactured and sold.</p>

<p>The Government will select up to fifteen (15) White Paper Concepts for invitation for a Virtual Presentation of their proposed concept to a panel of judges. The Virtual Presentation shall provide a summary of the white paper contents and include detail on how you intend to accomplish phase II objectives, provide a notional schedule, and a list of any concerns, clarifications or other questions you have regarding resources or information you need technical assistance with to accomplish the challenge. Up to five (5) winners will be selected to participate in Phase II.</p>

<p>Phase II objective is to design a detailed solution and demonstrate any Proof-of-Concept (POC) needed to provide confidence in the design. Results from the detailed design and POC testing will be provided to the Government team via another Virtual Presentation. Presentation should also include data supporting effectiveness of design along with identification of what design attributes will be considered vendor versus government purpose rights. Up to three (3) winners will be selected to participate in Phase III.</p>

<p>Phase III objective is to demonstrate a Technology Development Prototype. The Technology Development Prototype will be required to demonstrate the capability of withstanding the thermal runaway event of four lithium-ion military BB-2590 Bren-Tronics BT-70791CG or similar ~300 Wh Li-ion batteries. A single center-located battery should be triggered artificially by means of thermal abuse (e.g. via heat tape or some other suitable method). The technology development prototype should demonstrate the capability at ambient temperature to contain the thermal event without releasing flame, sparks or large particles while maintaining a surface temperature that would not trigger the combustion of adjacent materials. The container should also limit and preferably neutralize (reduce combustibility and/or toxicity) all released gases. Note that this type of testing is inherently hazardous, and Government personnel will consult with you on the safe execution of this POC in advance. All three winners may be selected to participate in Phase IV.</p>

<p>Phase IV the Government may choose to award follow-on FAR-based procurement contract, an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) award (under 10 U.S.C. 2371 or 2371b), a procurement contract for experimental purposes (10 U.S.C 2373), or a combination of awards under those authorities to any chosen participant in this prize challenge.</p>

<p>Initial submission of the White Paper Concept shall not exceed five pages and required to be in the following format.</p>

<p>a. Text size shall be no smaller than what is equivalent to Microsoft Word, Times New Roman, 10 point, uncompressed font.</p>

<p>b. Pages shall be single sided, one and one half line spaced, with a minimum of one inch margins on all sides. Pages shall be dated and numbered sequentially.</p>

<h4 id="questions--answers">Questions &amp; Answers</h4>

<p>Official responses to questions that have come in:</p>

<p>Question: Can the Challenge be extended by two weeks?</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Answer: We understand that COVID-19 has created unique challenges that all companies and the Government have had to innovate around. This effort, as with all Government projects, has its own set of deadlines and metrics that we must meet independent of the COVID-19 impacts. Our position is that the additional two-week extension that was given to extend the submission deadline to 07 May 2020 is sufficient for interested organizations to develop the minimalistic white paper submission required for Phase I. We do not intend at this time to provide any additional extensions to this initial phase of this challenge.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Question: While carefully reading the threshold parameters, we came across ‚ÄúPhysical dimension must have a single side that is less than 36‚Äù in circumference and 11.5‚Äù in radius‚Äù. It looks like that you are assuming the cylindrical object to hold four batteries and not rectangular. However, in order to have 36‚Äù circumference, is the 11.5‚Äù is radius or diameter. If its diameter, the calculations for circumference C (36‚Äù) = 2PI r = 2x3.14x5.75 would make sense. Please clarify.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Answer: The requirement is that one orientation of the containment system must have a maximum diameter of 23‚Äù. This containment system does not have to have a side that is round.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Question: Please clarify the dimension requirements and in particular this: ‚ÄúPhysical dimension must have a single side that is less than 36‚Äù in circumference and 11.5‚Äù in radius‚Äù. For a rectangular enclosure of dimensions 14.5‚Äù x 13.5‚Äù x 5.5‚Äù, how would you calculate the sides circumference and radius for such enclosure? Would it meet your requirements?</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Answer: The requirement is that one orientation of the containment system must have a maximum diameter of 23‚Äù. This containment system does not have to have a side that is round.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Question: Are the cells used in the BB-2590 Bren-Tronics BT-70791CG military battery cylindrical cells (i.e. 18650 or similar dimension) ; or are they polymer flat cells?</p>

<p>a. If they are cylindrical cells, how many cells comprise the battery? What is the composition of the cells and at what percentages? (i.e. Li-Cobalt, Li-Nickel, etc.)</p>

<p>b. If they are polymer flat cells, how many cells comprise the battery? What is the composition of the cells and at what percentages?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Answer: The BB-2590 batteries use the cylindrical format 18650 Li-ion cells configured as two series sets, each with 3 parallel strings of 4 cells in series, for 24 cells total in each BB-2590.</em></p>

    <p><em>a. For the answers, you may refer to the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) provided by the BB-2590 manufacturer for details on chemistry and composition of the cells used in the battery. As for cell count, you can obtain the number of cells based on the cell chemistry characteristics, case dimensions, battery overall capacity and voltage.</em></p>

    <p><em>b. Not applicable.</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Question: Can a company that is currently producing similar products and selling them modify a product to specifications set forth, or does the USN desire a prototype developed strictly for their use?</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Answer: As stated in the challenge, either a BB-2590 Bren-Tronics BT-70791CG or similar approximately 300 Wh Li-ion battery may be used. If you produce a battery that can be proposed for the challenge as ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù to the BB-2590 (meaning sufficiently close in Wh, voltage range, packaging and dimensions), that would be acceptable. You may submit details of your proposed substitute and we can give you a more definitive answer as to the suitability for the purposes of the challenge.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Question: What type of battery case is used for these batteries? E.g., metal and type of metal, plastic and type of plastic as well as thickness of plastic, other case materials?</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Answer: For details on the construction of the BB-2590 type batteries referenced in the challenge, please refer to the ‚Äúmilitary performance specification‚Äù document that specifies attributes of this type of battery. You may download this document, MIL-PRF-32052/1, from the web. The case is plastic, with an approximate thickness of 1/16th inch. Other case materials are listed generically in the manufacturers Safety Data Sheet document.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Question: Are there vents or other pressure relief mechanisms on the battery cases?</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Answer: For details on the construction of the BB-2590 type batteries (including the case vent) referenced in the challenge, please refer to the ‚Äúmilitary performance specification‚Äù document that specifies attributes of this type of battery. You may download this document, MIL-PRF-32052/1, from the web.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Question: What is the Wh rating of the individual cells in these batteries at 100% State of Charge (SOC)?</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Answer: For the Wh rating of the individual cells, you may refer to the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) provided by the BB-2590 manufacturer for details on chemistry and composition of the cells used in the battery you chose. It is possible to estimate the cell-level Wh rating for the specific cells being used in the BB-2590 you are considering using. The Wh estimate can be calculated from the number of cells in the battery (24 total for BB-2590, configured as two series sets, each with 3 parallel strings of 4 cells in series), the cell chemistry characteristics, and, battery overall capacity and voltage.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Question: Will NSWC assist us in sourcing the military versions of these batteries from the manufacturer(s) and authorized distributors?</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Answer: Given the time and resources it would take to acquire and distribute these batteries and the process involved with re-selling or otherwise supplying ‚Äúgovernment furnished materials,‚Äù NSWC Crane will not be able to provide batteries to participants. The BB-2590 type battery referred to in the challenge can be readily purchased from multiple sources.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Question: Alternatively, would NSWC be willing to purchase the military versions of these batteries in bulk for participants in the challenge and sell them to participants at cost?</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Answer: Given the time and resources it would take to acquire and distribute these batteries and the process involved with re-selling or otherwise supplying ‚Äúgovernment furnished materials,‚Äù NSWC Crane will not be able to provide batteries to participants. The BB-2590 type battery referred to in the challenge can be readily purchased from multiple sources.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Question: We currently produce a containment system that has been tested to similar standards. Can we modify that product for the challenge or does the USN want a completely new product?</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Answer: Yes, you can modify your current containment product to meet the goals of the challenge. Note that the judging criteria rewards innovation in proposed solutions over existing products. Modifications to existing products would still be regarded positively if the innovation substantially enhanced the existing product‚Äôs performance.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Question: For the Proof of Concept testing at what state of charge (SOC) is required of the battery during testing?</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Answer: All batteries are required to be at 100% SOC.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Question: Does the ‚Äúreferences‚Äù section (i.e., the bibliography of references used to prepare the white paper) at the end of the white paper count toward the five-page limit? The NSWC-CR document provided in Challenge.gov does not talk about this although the document does state that the cover sheets at the beginning of the white paper concept will not be counted toward the five-page limit.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Answer: The references page is not included the page count limitation.</em></li>
</ul>
