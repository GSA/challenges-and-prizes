I"s<p>An interested Participant (individual, team, or legal entity) must initiate the process of participating in the Competition by registering at the ARIAC website. The party is then given access to view the documentation and download the tutorials (which provides instructions on how to run the simulations) from the ARIAC website. In the event NIST determines modifications to the documentation and tutorials are needed, all website registrants will be notified by email.</p>
<p>Once registered, the Participants are eligible to participate in the qualifier. The qualifier will occur in the April 2020 timeframe (specific deadlines will be published at the official challenge website and all Participants notified by email). Participants must complete the qualifier to be eligible to compete in the final competition. A minimum score will be determined, based on the metrics described below, which Participants have to meet or exceed in the qualifier to be eligible for the final competition.</p>
<p>Participants will run the qualifier from their own location. They will have two weeks from the date that the qualifier is released on the website (available to be downloaded) to submit their software control system that addresses the challenges in the qualifier. Registered participants will be emailed when the qualifier is released. They should run the qualifier at their own location and submit the resulting output files generated by their control system (listed below). Their output files should be uploaded to an account (nfiles.nist.gov) that NIST will set up specifically for each Participant.</p>
<p>Specific files that need to be submitted include:</p>
<ul> <li>Their environment configuration file specifying your choice of sensors.</li> <li>A performance log file that contains information about the task completion.</li> <li>A simulation state log file that contains information about the state of Gazebo during the trial.</li> </ul>
<h3>Competition Scenarios</h3>
<p>The following terminology is frequently used in this document:</p>
<ul> <li>Order:&nbsp; A list of parts and their goal location on a tray.</li> <li>Part:&nbsp; One element of an order.</li> <li>Tray:&nbsp; A surface that hold parts.</li> <li>Kit:&nbsp; A tray and set of parts that make up an order.</li> </ul>
<p>ARIAC requires participants to complete a series of tests centered in an industrial scenario that are based around building kits made up of particular parts. The robot system will work within the environment specified in the work environment section.</p>
<p>There are three different test scenarios that all involve moving parts from a supply location to a tray. The possible supply locations are a conveyor belt, and stationary bins. Challenges will be introduced in each scenario. Scenarios may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul> <li><strong>Scenario 1:&nbsp; Baseline Kit Building:&nbsp; </strong>The first scenario is intended as a baseline set of tasks for the other test methods to be compared against. The task for this scenario is to pick specific parts and place them on a tray. The robot arms will receive an “Order” that details the list of parts and their target locations. Orders are covered in more detail in the Orders section.</li> <li><strong>Scenario 2:&nbsp; Dropped Part:&nbsp; </strong>The task for Scenario 2 is identical to Scenario 1, however one or more parts will drop from the robots’ gripper. The robots will need to recover after dropping a part and complete the given Order. Recovery could entail picking up the dropped part or fetching a new part.</li> <li>Scenario 3:&nbsp; In-Process Kit Change:&nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;While the robots are in the middle of assembling a kit, a new high priority order will be received that needs to be completed as fast as possible. The robots will need to decide how best to complete this new order, and then complete the previous order.</li> </ul>
<h3>Fifteen Trials</h3>
<p>The competition will consist of 15 trials:&nbsp; 5 trials of each of the 3 scenarios. Each trial will receive a score based on completion and efficiency metrics outlined in the Scoring section.</p>
<h4>Robot Arm</h4>
<ul> <li>The two robot arms used in each trial will be Universal Robots UR10.</li> <li>The robot arms’ position is controlled through the linear actuator on which it is mounted.</li> <li>The end of the arms are equipped with a vacuum gripper. The vacuum gripper is controlled in a binary manner and reports whether or not it is successfully gripping an object.</li> </ul>
<h4>Sensors</h4>
<p>A Participant can place sensors around the environment. Each sensor has a cost that factors into the final score. A sample of available sensors may include:</p>
<ol> <li>Break beam:&nbsp; reports when a beam is broken by an object. It does not provide distance information.</li> <li>Laser scanner:&nbsp; provides an array of distances to a sensed object.</li> <li>Cognex logical camera:&nbsp; provides information about the pose and type of all models within its field of view.</li> <li>Proximity:&nbsp; detects the range to an object.</li> </ol>
<h4>Order</h4>
<p>An order is an instruction containing kits for the robot system to complete. Each order will specify the kit to be assembled, (i.e. the list of parts to be put in the kit). Each specified part has the following structure:</p>
<ul> <li>The type of part.</li> <li>The position and orientation of the part on the tray.</li> </ul>
<h4>Faulty parts</h4>
<p>Above each AGV is a quality control sensor that detects faulty parts. If faulty parts are detected while teams are filling trays, those parts should be removed from the tray and replaced with another part of the same type. Faulty parts are considered unwanted parts:&nbsp; they will not count for any points when the kit is submitted, and they will cost teams the all-parts bonus if left in trays.</p>
<h4>Competition process</h4>
<p>Each trial will consist of the following steps:</p>
<ul> <li>The robots programmatically signal that they are able to begin accepting orders.</li> <li>The first Order (Order 1) is sent to the robots.</li> <li>A fixed amount of time is allowed to complete the order.</li> <li>In the case of the Dropped Part testing method, up to three parts will be forcibly dropped from the gripper.</li> <li>In the case of the In-Process Kit Change testing method, a new Order (Order 2) will be issued that is of higher priority than the previously issued Order 1. When Order 2 is complete, building of Order 1 is to resume.</li> <li>The robots signal programmatically when a kit is complete and ready for quality control.</li> <li>The robot system will be notified that the trial is over. The trial is over when time runs out or all Orders have been fulfilled.</li> </ul>
