I"9<p><strong>The goals of this Challenge are viable materials that will result in increased safety and protection for athletes, the warfighter, and civilians.  </strong>The NFL, Under Armour, GE and NIST have established a joint effort to advance the state-of-the-art in advanced materials for impact mitigation. We seek to stimulate the development of a range of materials that provide excellent energy absorbing and energy dissipating properties.  Materials submitted to the Challenge can be from a variety of classes, <strong>which may include, but are not limited to</strong>:  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Aerogels&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Field-Affected materials&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Filamentous materials&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Foams&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Lattice materials&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Low weight materials&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Non-Newtonian materials&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Smart materials&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Other types of materials&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Head Health Challenge III is a call for novel materials that maximize energy absorption and minimize momentum transfer. If invited to submit a sample, a material must, at a minimum meet the following criteria: (1) Withstand a force range of 3-12kN; (2) Have the potential for withstanding 1200 impacts above 20 KE (J); (3) Perform in the impact velocity range of 3.4 m/s to 11.2 m/s; and (4) Maintain performance in the temperature range of -30C to 40C and humidity range of 40% to 100%.    If your material meets the performance criteria above and you would like to participate in this challenge, you will be required to complete an abstract template.  &lt;ol&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>A brief non-confidential description of the proposed material </strong>and why it is novel with respect to its proposed application for impact protection.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>A submission of preliminary test data</strong> supported by an explanation of the data relevance and the data collection methods for the material. (NOTE: This should be submitted through the submit page on the Challenge Website)&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>An explanation of the </strong>technology readiness level of your material.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>The Intellectual Property status </strong>of the material.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>The expertise and capabilities</strong> of the applicant team.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  If you are invited to advance in the challenge, you will be notified by email and given instructions to submit a more detailed proposal, along with samples of your material for potential testing. A panel of judges with select up to six awardees to receive Round 1 Awards. Over the course of a year, the six awardees will further develop their materials over the course of a year. At the conclusion of that year a panel of judges will select a Grand Prize Winner.     </p>
