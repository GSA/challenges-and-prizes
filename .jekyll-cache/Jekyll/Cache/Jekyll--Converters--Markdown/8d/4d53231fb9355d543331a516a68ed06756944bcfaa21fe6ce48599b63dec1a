To be eligible to win the Challenge, the nominee must  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Be a U.S. licensed clinician, practicing in any U.S. setting, who provides continuing care for adult patients with hypertension. In the case of an individual, whether participating singly or in a group, the individual must be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Or be a U.S. incorporated clinical practice, defined as any practice with two or more U.S. licensed clinicians who by formal arrangement share responsibility for a common panel of patients, practice at the same physical location or street address, and provide continuing medical care for adult patients with hypertension.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;In the case of a private entity, the private entity shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the U.S.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Or be a health system that provides continuing medical care for adult patients with hypertension. In the case of a private entity, the private entity shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the U.S.  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;A health system provides a wide range of medical services and coordination of care for patients and their dependents.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;We encourage large health systems (those that comprise of a large number of geographically dispersed clinics or have multiple hospital locations, or both) to consider having one or a few of the highest performing clinics or regional affiliates apply individually instead of the health system applying as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;For purposes of this Challenge, an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) may apply as an ACO or one or more of its practices can apply independently.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  In addition, the clinician, practice, or health system:  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Must treat all adult patients with hypertension in the practice seeking care, not a select subgroup of patients.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Must treat a minimum of 500 adult patients annually.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Must have completed the nomination in its entirety.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Must have a hypertension control rate of at least 70% during the 12 month reporting period among the practice’s hypertensive patient population.

To the extent applicable law allows, data will be kept confidential by the contractor and will be shared with the CDC in aggregate form only (i.e., the hypertension control rate for the practice not individual hypertension values).&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Agree to be recognized if selected, agree to accept the award if selected, and participate in award activities as described more fully below.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Provide information through a 60 minute, or other similar, interview about their clinical strategies and protocol implementation for the development of a success story document.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Complete, without revisions, the CDC contractor’s required HIPAA compliance Business Associate Agreement form.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Individual nominees and individuals in a group practice must be free from convictions or pending investigations of criminal and health care fraud offenses such as felony health care fraud, patient abuse or neglect; felony convictions for other health care-related fraud, theft, or other financial misconduct; and felony convictions relating to unlawful manufacture, distribution, prescription, or dispensing of controlled substances as verified through the <strong><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/background.asp" target="_blank">Office of the Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals and Entities</a></strong>. Individual nominees must be free from serious sanctions, such as those for misuse or mis-prescribing of prescription medications. Such serious sanctions will be determined at the discretion of the agency consistent with CDC’s public health mission. CDC’s contractor may perform background checks on individual clinicians or medical practices.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Health systems must have a policy in place about conducting periodic background checks on all providers and taking appropriate action based on the results of the check. CDC’s contractor may also request the policy and any supporting information deemed necessary. Eligibility status, based upon the above-reference written policy, appropriate action, and background check, will be determined at the discretion of the CDC consistent with CDC’s public health mission.  The background check should ensure that staff are free from convictions of pending investigations of criminal and health care fraud offenses such as felony health care fraud, patient abuse or neglect; felony convictions for other health care-related fraud, theft, or other financial misconduct; and felony convictions relating to unlawful manufacture, distribution prescribing, or dispensing of controlled substances as verified through the <strong><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/background.asp" target="_blank">Office of the Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals and Entities</a></strong>. The policy must ensure that staff are free from serious sanctions, such as those for misuse or mis-prescribing of prescription medication. Such serious sanctions well be determined at the discretion of the CDC consistent with CDC’s public health mission. In addition, a health system background check will include a search for The Joint Commission sanctions and current investigations for serious institutional misconduct (e.g., investigations for professional medical misconduct). CDC’s contractor may request the policy and any supporting information deemed necessary.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) employees are not eligible to apply.

Federal contractors may not use federal funds from a contract to develop COMPETES Act challenge applications or to fund efforts in support of a COMPETES Act challenge.

Applicants submitting research studies, pilot studies, or entries that limit hypertension control data submitted to a subset of the provider or health system population such as treatment cohorts, patients of a specific age range, or patients enrolled in limited quality improvement projects are not eligible.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Federal grantees and contractors:&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Federal grantees may not use federal funds to develop COMPETES Act Challenge applications unless consistent with the purpose of their grant award and specifically requested to do so due to competition design, and as announced in the Federal Register.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Federal contractors may not use federal funds from a contract to develop COMPETES Act Challenge applications or to fund efforts in support of a COMPETES Act Challenge submission. Costs associated with such activities are unallowable and are not allocable to government contracts.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, no persons are required to respond to a collection or information unless it displays a valid OMB control number.  The valid OMB Control number for this information collection is 0920-0976 which expires December 31, 2019.
