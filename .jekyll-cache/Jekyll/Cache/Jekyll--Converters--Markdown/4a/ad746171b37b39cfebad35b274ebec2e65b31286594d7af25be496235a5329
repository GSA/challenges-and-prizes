I"d<p><b>Calling all data enthusiasts and innovators to harness existing open health data to develop visualizations and tools for health care providers and public health officials to better tackle obesity!</b>    <strong>All entries are due by 9 AM ET, Monday, Aug. 3, 2015</strong></p>
<p><i>The U.S. Obesity Data Challenge is a parallel, but separate prize-based competition. Learn more about the Obesity Data Challenge led by National Health Service (NHS) England and their organizing partner, Rewired State </i><a href="http://obesitychallenge.rewiredstate.org"><i>here</i></a>.  <h2><b>THE PROBLEM</b></h2>  Obesity is a common problem for the United States, U.K., and indeed for much of the developed world. Two in three adults in the U.S. and 64% of U.K. adults are overweight or obese (Ogden, 2014). But the epidemic is not limited to the developed world; about one billion adults in the developing world are overweight or obese (PHE, 2014). Obesity contributes to a host of other diseases, including increased risk of heart attack, strokes and diabetes.</p>
<p>Societal, economic, and cultural conditions all contribute to the obesity epidemic. These factors include (but are not limited to) personal food choices, cost and access to healthful foods, individual physical activity, genetic predisposition, and other demographic and environmental risk factors.</p>
<p>Currently, volumes of data exist, but they aren’t always put to use for the benefit of individual patients or their communities – or, just as commonly, data are used selectively, without the full power that comes from combining data from multiple sources. Many are unaware that relevant data even exists, and few have the capability to combine or visualize data in sophisticated ways. With communities coming together to address obesity as a critical issue, it’s time to provide better tools that put these data to work<b>.</b>  </p>
<p><h2><b>THE CHALLENGE</b></h2>  Challenge participants should utilize and mash up open data to develop new data visualization tools to give communities, local health officials, patients and practitioners new means to improve population health. Winning solutions will enable public health and health care professionals to help patients and families address the obesity epidemic at a personal and community level.  Be creative with this, the sky’s the limit for your mashup.    <b>A FEW HELPFUL  GUIDELINES:</b>  <ul>   <li>The data used to develop a solution, tool, or visualization for this challenge <b>must include at least one open data set from a U.S. government resource. </b></li>   <li>While your chosen datasets could be directly related to health, we are interested in seeing what you can create from cross-sector, cross-departmental data (e.g., geographic location, availability of healthy food choices, possibilities for exercise, hereditary traits of demographic populations, or personal health inputs).</li>   <li>There are a number of tools already in the marketplace that simply tracking diet or exercise, so <b>we’re looking for more complex solutions that offer particularly new and creative approaches </b>to supporting individuals and populations in better health incorporating multiple data points and open data sets.</li>   <li><b>All solutions should ensure the confidentiality of individuals</b>.</li>   <li><b>Any data used should be openly available </b>and thus conforming to information governance best practice.</li>  </ul>  <b>A FEW DATA RESOURCES TO GET YOU STARTED:</b>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.healthindicators.gov/Indicators/Search?Query=obesity">Health Indicators Warehouse, Obesity</a></li>   <li>CDC <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/prevalence-maps.html">Obesity Prevalence Maps</a></li>   <li>CMS, <a href="http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Briefs/B2013/mmrr-2013-003-02-b02.html">How much do chronic conditions cost?</a></li>   <li>National Center for Health Statistics Faststats: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm">Obesity and Overweight </a></li>   <li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm">NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)</a></li>   <li>NIH, <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi_tbl.htm">Body Mass Index Table</a></li>   <li><a title="Food Deserts" href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/food-access-research-atlas" target="_blank">Food deserts</a></li>   <li><a href="http://www.data.gov/food/farmers-market-api/" target="_blank">Farmers Market Locations</a></li>   <li><a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=bike+paths" target="_blank">Bicycle Path Locations</a></li>   <li><a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?publisher=data.cityofchicago.org" target="_blank">Locations of Parks in Chicago</a></li>   <li><a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/safe-route-to-schools-priority-schools-4c0cb" target="_blank">Safe Routes to Schools in New York City</a></li>  </ul>  <i>Participants are invited to utilize other datasets not listed here.</i>    <b>QUESTIONS YOUR SUBMISSION MIGHT ADDRESS</b>  <ul>   <li>How can data visualization tools using cross-sectional data support health care providers and local health officials in making actionable suggestions to patients and families dealing with obesity?</li>   <li>How can health care providers and local health officials share comprehensive data on community access to healthy food choices and physical activity options along with demographic variables for meaningful conversations with patients and families?</li>   <li>How are the various contributory factors to obesity related?</li>   <li>What can we learn from relationships among where we live and obesity, perhaps considering food deserts, poor access to affordable healthy foods, a dearth of public recreational activities, and socioeconomic statistics?</li>   <li>How can patients be supported through informed choices using data on community access to food and physical activity?</li>   <li>How can cross-sectional data empower patients dealing with obesity to find solutions that fit their needs?</li>   <li>Can we drive recommendations for obese populations using personal demographic inputs, known rates of obesity for those demographics, and geography specific data about rates of fast food consumption versus locations for healthy food options?</li>   <li>How can data support people to change their behaviors in ways that prevent obesity or improve their existing condition?</li>  </ul>  <h2><b>SUBMISSION</b></h2>  <b>HOW TO ENTER:</b>    Please submit the following items:  <ul>   <li><b>Written description of project (maximum 750 words)</b>.
