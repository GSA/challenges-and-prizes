<p>We are seeking submissions of automated scoring models to score constructed response items for the National Assessment of Educational Progress‚Äôs reading assessment. The purpose of the challenge is to help NAEP determine the existing capabilities, accuracy metrics, the underlying validity evidence of assigned scores, and costs and efficiencies of using automated scoring with the NAEP reading assessment items. The Challenge requires that submissions demonstrate interpretability of models, provide score predictions using these models, analyze models for potential bias based on student demographic characteristics, and provide cost information for putting an automated scoring system into operational use.</p>
