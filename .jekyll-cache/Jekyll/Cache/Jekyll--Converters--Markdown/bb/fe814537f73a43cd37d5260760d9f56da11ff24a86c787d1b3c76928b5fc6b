The Great Lakes are a valuable asset, attracting people and businesses. They directly support 1.5 million U.S. jobs and $62 billion in U.S. wages.    While progress is being made in restoring the Great Lakes, climate change, water quality concerns and invasive species still threaten the Great Lakes ecosystem.  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong>Climate change </strong>is expected to raise the Great Lakes water temperature, lower lake levels, drive more frequent, large storm events and reduce winter ice cover. These impacts will change the way people and wildlife inhabit and use the natural resources of the Great Lakes Basin.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong>Great Lakes water quality </strong>is compromised by aqricultural and urban runoff, harmful algal blooms, aging water infrastructure, and oil and hazardous material spills. Water quality impairments close beaches, degrade habitats, threaten public drinking water supplies and restrict recreational opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong>Invasive species </strong>compromise the integrity of the Great Lakes ecosystem. They disrupt the food web, leading to declines in the commercial and sport fishery. They impact municipal, recreational and industrial water users by clogging intake pipes and reducing recreational opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong>Data Quality Evaluation.</strong> With advancements in technology innovation, observing systems are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and monitoring and observing data are now commonly available to stakeholders through websites and data portals.  However, one of the big challenges with such wide access to data today is that the quality of the data provided to data consumers is often unknown.  Even in situations where quality information is provided by the data collector, it is frequently overlooked by the data consumer because it is often difficult to access and interpret.  In turn, data consumers are consuming data of an unknown quality which can have large impacts on their data analysis and derived data products, which can have further impacts on subsequent resource management decisions.  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<em>(For this challenge, participants should use open data from the GLOS data portal (<a href="http://portal.glos.us/">http://portal.glos.us/</a>) to develop new tools to quantify and/or illustrate, on-the-fly, the quality of the data available. Ideally this solution would look at large volumes of data and automatically determine the quality of the data when it is selected/requested by a data consumer. A solution that provided some quantitative measurement of data uncertainty would certainly receive top honors.</em><em> </em>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<em>Winning solutions will enable data consumers in the Great Lakes region to assess the quality and uncertainty of the data they are utilizing in their data analysis and subsequent resource management decisions.)</em>&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  We look to harness the power of information technology to provide solutions to these problems and take advantage of the economic opportunities inherent in our shared abundant water resource.    <strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong>    Challenge participants should use open data to develop new data tools that give communities, recreational users and natural resource managers new means to improve the health of the Great Lakes ecosystem or to provide better access to ecosystem services within the Basin. Create an app, mash-up or visualization that uncovers trends, reveals patterns, or shows how ecosystem services could be more efficiently utilized and can persuade people to take action.    Enter the GLOS Data Challenge to make a difference in the world – and to earn cash prizes.    Winning solutions will enable government, industry, business, non-profit and recreational sectors in the Great Lakes region to address problems or build on opportunities at a personal, community or Great Lakes region level. Be creative with this, the sky’s the limit for your solution.    Winners will have their app/visualization featured on http://www.glos.us/ and will receive a cash prize.
