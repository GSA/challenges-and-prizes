I"Š<p><strong>Performance. </strong>The degree to which the integrated design (including sensor, platform, and data analysis) indicates an ability to achieve or exceed the necessary data requirements for production of the WMM (see target performance metrics in <a href="https://www.magquest.com/additional-resources/">Additional Resources</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Technical Feasibility. </strong>The extent to which the design uses technically sound methods, the solver identifies potential risks, and proposes credible mitigation strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Feasibility and Cost Fidelity. </strong>The degree to which the design accounts for real-world implementation and operation in the near term (e.g., 5 years), as well as the ability to continuously and reliably collect data for several WMM iterations (e.g., 30 years).</p>
<p><strong>Innovation. </strong>The degree to which the design creates potential efficiencies in time, money, or other resources.</p>
<p><strong>Team. </strong>The extent to which the solver or team demonstrates sufficient expertise that may be needed to advance their integrated design to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 5, and preferably 6, within a potential timeframe of two years (e.g., by September 2021). (see Technology Readiness Assessment in <a href="https://www.magquest.com/additional-resources/">Additional Resources</a> for more information on TRLs)</p>
