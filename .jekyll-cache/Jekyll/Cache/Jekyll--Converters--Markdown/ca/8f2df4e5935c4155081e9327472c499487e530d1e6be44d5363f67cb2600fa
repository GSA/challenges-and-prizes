<p>Teams participating in the AI Tracks at Sea Challenge spanned collegiate institutions from east to west U.S. coasts, from both public and private colleges and universities. Collectively, the student submissions for the challenge represent various types of STEM research institutions, Ivy League Schools, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Hispanic Serving Institutes (HSI). Of the challenge teams, 26% were comprised of students from HBCUs and 16% of the teams attend HSIs.</p>

<p>“With 94% of the competitors attending colleges and universities outside of California, this challenge served as an avenue to make broader impacts in STEM,” said Yolanda Tanner, Naval Information Warfare Systems Command (NAVWAR) STEM Federal Action Officer and NIWC Pacific Internship and Fellowship project manager. “It was also a means by which students could further develop their STEM skills while working collaboratively to solve a real-world naval problem.”</p>

<p>Florida, North Carolina, and Texas had the largest population of participating collegiate teams.</p>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>The Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC) Pacific and the Naval Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Coordination Office, managed by the Office of Naval Research are conducting the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tracks at Sea challenge.  The goal of this challenge is to engage with the workforce of tomorrow on challenging and relevant naval problems.  The need here is to augment unmanned surface vehicles’ (USVs’) maritime contact tracking capability.  Current traffic avoidance software relies on AIS and radar for tracking other craft and avoiding collisions.  However, in a contested environment, emitting radar energy presents a vulnerability to detection by adversaries.  Deactivating RF transmitting sources mitigates the threat of detection, but without additional sensing and sensor fusion, it would also degrade the USV’s ability to monitor shipping traffic in its vicinity.  The technology developed for this prize challenge will solve this problem by developing a computer vision system that will plot the tracks of shipping traffic exclusively using the passive sensing capability of onboard cameras.  This technology would also be applicable for the Navy to document vessels performing unsafe navigation on the high seas.</p>
