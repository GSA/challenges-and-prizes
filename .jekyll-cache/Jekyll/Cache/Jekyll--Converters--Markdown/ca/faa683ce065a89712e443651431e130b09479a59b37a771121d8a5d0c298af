<h4 id="eligibility-to-participate-in-the-competition"><strong>Eligibility to participate in the Competition</strong></h4>

<p>Participation in the ARIAC Prize Competition is open to ALL; however, not all participants are eligible to win cash prizes as explained in the next section.</p>

<p>Each Competition Participant (individual, team, or legal entity) is required to register on the ARIAC website. There shall be one Official Representative for each Competition Participant. The Official Representative must provide a name, username (which may serve as a team or affiliation name), email address, and affirm that he/she has read and consents to be governed by the Competition Rules. Multiple registrations per Participant are NOT allowed. At NIST‚Äôs discretion, any violation of this rule will be grounds for disqualification from the Competition. Multiple individuals and/or legal entities may collaborate as a team to submit a single entry (Participant‚Äôs code submission to a qualifier or final), in which case the designated Official Representative will be responsible for meeting all entry and evaluation requirements. Participation is subject to all U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. Participants are responsible for checking applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction(s) before participating in the prize challenge to ensure that their participation is legal.  The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology shall not, by virtue of conducting this prize challenge, be responsible for compliance by Participants in the prize challenge with Federal Law including licensing, export control, and nonproliferation laws, and related regulations.  Participants must not be suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded from doing business with the Federal Government. Individuals entering on behalf of or representing a company, institution or other legal entity are responsible for confirming that their entry does not violate any policies of that company, institution or legal entity. Any other individuals or legal entities involved with the design, production, execution, distribution or evaluation of ARIAC are not eligible to participate.</p>

<p>Once registered, Participants will have access to the interfaces needed to participate in the competition through the ARIAC website. NIST will create an account to allow the Participants to upload their submissions to the qualifier. Modifications and improvements to a Participant‚Äôs control system during the qualifying period are to be expected, but the Participant should have one final control system ready for the final competition.</p>

<h4 id="eligibility-to-win-a-cash-prize"><strong>Eligibility to win a Cash Prize</strong></h4>

<p>To be eligible for a cash prize:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Participant (whether an individual, team, or legal entity) must have registered to participate and complied with all of the requirements under section 3719 of title 15, United States Code as contained herein.</li>
  <li>At the time of entry, the Official Representative (individual or team lead, in the case of a group project) must be age 18 or older and a U.S. citizen or permanent resident of the United States or its territories.</li>
  <li>In the case of a private entity, the business shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States or its territories.</li>
  <li>Participants may not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment. NIST employees are not eligible to participate. Non-NIST Federal employees acting in their personal capacities should consult with their respective agency ethics officials to determine whether their participation in this Competition is permissible.</li>
  <li>A Participant shall not be deemed ineligible because the Participant consulted with Federal employees or used Federal facilities in preparing its submission to the ARIAC Prize Competition if the Federal employees and facilities are made available to all Participants on an equitable basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, interested Participants who do not meet the eligibility requirements to win a prize (i.e., individuals who are neither a US citizen nor a permanent resident of the United States or non-US-based entities) are encouraged to participate in the Competition. They are invited to register on the ARIAC website and download the training material. The performance obtained by these Participants will be displayed on the ARIAC website in the same manner as the performance obtained by Participants who are eligible to win cash prizes. Participants found to be ineligible for cash prizes may still be publicly recognized. In the event that the prize award normally allotted to the place or rank of an ineligible participant occurs, the cash prize will be awarded to the next eligible participant in the series or ranking. Individuals on the denied persons list or from entities or countries sanctioned by the United States Government are not eligible to participate.</p>

<h4 id="competition-scenarios"><strong>Competition Scenarios</strong></h4>

<p>The following terminology is frequently used in this document:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><em>Order:</em></strong> A list of parts and their goal location on a tray.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Part:</em></strong> One element of an order.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Tray:</em></strong> A surface that hold parts.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Kit:</em></strong> A tray and set of parts that make up an order.</li>
</ol>

<p>ARIAC requires participants to complete a series of tests centered in an industrial scenario that are based around building kits made up of particular parts. The robot system will work within the environment specified in the work environment section.</p>

<p>There are three different test scenarios that all involve moving parts from a supply location to a tray. The possible supply locations are a conveyor belt, and stationary bins. Challenges will be introduced in each scenario. Scenarios may include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Scenario 1: Baseline Kit Building</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The first scenario is intended as a baseline set of tasks for the other test methods to be compared against. The task for this scenario is to pick specific parts and place them on a tray. The robot arms will receive an ‚ÄúOrder‚Äù that details the list of parts and their target locations. Orders are covered in more detail in the Orders section.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Scenario 2: Dropped Part</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The task for Scenario 2 is identical to Scenario 1, however one or more parts will drop from the robots‚Äô gripper. The robots will need to recover after dropping a part and complete the given Order. Recovery could entail picking up the dropped part or fetching a new part.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Scenario 3: In-Process Kit Change</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>While the robots are in the middle of assembling a kit, a new high priority order will be received that needs to be completed as fast as possible. The robots will need to decide how best to complete this new order, and then complete the previous order.</p>

<p>The competition will consist of 15 trials: 5 trials of each of the 3 scenarios. Each trial will receive a score based on completion and efficiency metrics outlined in the Scoring section.</p>

<p><strong>Environment</strong></p>

<p>The Simulation environment is a representation of an industrial kitting work cell and assembly workstations. One robot arm on a linear rail, one robot on a gantry system, a conveyer belt, parts bins, trays, and assembly stations.
The conveyor belt is a <strong>1 m wide</strong> plane that transports objects across the work environment at a fixed speed of roughly <strong>0.2 m/s</strong>. Parts continuously appear on the belt for the duration of the trial. When parts reach the end of the conveyor belt they are automatically removed. Teams can control the conveyor belt during development, but not during the final competition.</p>

<p>There are eight part bins that may be used for building kits. Parts in these bins will not be replaced once used.</p>

<p>There are two robot arms; one mounted on a single base on a linear actuator that runs parallel to the conveyor belt, the other mounted hanging from a two-dimensional gantry that operates both parallel and perpendicular to the conveyor belt. The Linear actuator measures 4 m.</p>

<p>Four Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) are located along the Linear actuator. Kits are built on top of these AGVs. A team will programmatically signal the AGVs when the kits are ready to be taken away. The signaled AGV will depart for the indicated Assembly Station.</p>

<p>The trays used for assembling kits are flat trays measuring <strong>0.5 x 0.7 m</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Robot Arm</strong></p>

<p>The two robot arms used in each trial will be Universal Robots UR10.</p>

<p>The Robot arms‚Äô positions are controlled through the linear actuator or gantry on which they are mounted.</p>

<p>The end of the arms are equipped with a vacuum gripper. The vacuum gripper is controlled in a binary manner and reports whether or not it is successfully gripping an object.</p>

<p><strong>Sensors</strong></p>

<p>A Participant can place sensors around the environment. Each sensor has a cost that factors into the final score.</p>

<p>A sample of available sensors may include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Break beam: reports when a beam is broken by an object. It does not provide distance information.</li>
  <li>Laser scanner: provides an array of distances to a sensed object.</li>
  <li>Cognex logical camera: provides information about the pose and type of all models within its field of view.</li>
  <li>Proximity: detects the range to an object.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Order</strong></p>

<p>An order is an instruction containing kits for the robot system to complete.</p>

<p>Each order will specify the kit to be assembled, i.e. the list of parts to be put in the kit.</p>

<p>Each specified part has the following structure:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The type of part.</li>
  <li>The position and orientation of the part on the tray.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Faulty parts</strong></p>

<p>Above each AGV is a quality control sensor that detects faulty parts. If faulty parts are detected while teams are filling trays, those parts should be removed from the tray and replaced with another part of the same type. Faulty parts are considered unwanted parts: they will not count for any points when the kit is submitted, and they will cost teams the all-parts bonus if left in trays.</p>

<p><strong>Competition process</strong></p>

<p>Each trial will consist of the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The robots programmatically signal that they are able to begin accepting orders.</li>
  <li>The first Order (Order 1) is sent to the robots.</li>
  <li>A fixed amount of time is allowed to complete the order.</li>
  <li>In the case of the Dropped Part testing method, up to three parts will be forcibly dropped from the gripper.</li>
  <li>In the case of the In-Process Kit Change testing method, a new Order (Order 2) will be issued that is of higher priority than the previously issued Order 1. When Order 2 is complete, building of Order 1 is to resume.</li>
  <li>The robots signal programmatically when a kit is complete and ready for quality control.</li>
  <li>The robot system will be notified that the trial is over. The trial is over when time runs out or all Orders have been fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
