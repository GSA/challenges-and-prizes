<p><strong>Judging Panel</strong></p>

<p><strong>Part 1:</strong> All eligible entities shall submit a concept white paper and an accompanying single-slide summary chart outlining their technology, the potential impact on the US military, the scientific viability of their approach, and the dual-use technology applications for both the commercial and defense space, and submission quality. Each concept white paper and accompanying single-slide summary chart will be reviewed by DoD and international stakeholders including user, program acquisition, and research and development subject matter experts.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> In Part 2, the selected participants will conduct a pitch (live in-person or virtual) to a panel of DoD and international subject matter experts at the pitch event tentatively scheduled early September 2021 (dates will be finalized with participants). Participants will pitch their technology concept and team ability to a representative DoD and international panel from the AI eco-system representing user, program acquisition, and research and development subject matter experts. Each participant will have 20 minutes to pitch, followed by 10 minutes for questions and answers with the judgesâ€™ panel. The option to pitch virtually will be offered to finalists who are not able to travel, either due to personal reasons or country restrictions.</p>

<p>Detailed instructions and evaluation criteria will be provided to the finalists.</p>

<p>Detailed feedback from the Technology Pitch panel will be provided to the participants of the technology pitch phase. The purpose of providing this feedback is to help accelerate transition of the technology to a US military end-user by providing insight on best applications for the technology within the US military, suggestions for product improvement for military use, and recommended next steps for development. However, the Government will not respond to questions or inquiries regarding this feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Judging Criteria</strong></p>

<p>Concept white papers and accompanying single-slide summary charts will be evaluated and ranked using the following scoring criteria (further details on each scoring dimension can be found on the xTechGlobal AI Challenge registration page):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Summary Chart â€“ 10%</li>
  <li>Technology Concept and Viability â€“ 30%</li>
  <li>Potential for Impact/Revolutionizing the Army â€“ 30%</li>
  <li>Commercial Potential â€“ 20%</li>
  <li>Submission Quality â€“ 10%</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon conclusion of the Concept white paper evaluation period, the Government will select up to ten (10) participants to receive a prize award of $10,000 each and an invitation to Part 2: Final Technology Pitches, tentatively scheduled for early September 2021.</p>
