I"ü<p>Rebuild by Design (RBD) is an initiative of the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Itâ€™s goal is to develop innovative, fundable, and implementable solutions to better protect residents from future storms and climate events.     RBD was a multi-phase process beginning with regional research and analysis, which then led to site-specific design development. The entire process is rooted in strong community engagement and public outreach.</p>
