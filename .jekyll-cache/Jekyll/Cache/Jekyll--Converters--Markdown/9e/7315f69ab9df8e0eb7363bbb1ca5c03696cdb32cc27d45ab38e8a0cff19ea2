<p>Participants may also choose to suggest additional metrics in the areas of nutrition, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and/or sleep. If additional metrics are included, the participant should include a short description of the data and how it might inform public health efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Phase II (Prototype Implementation Phase)</strong></p>
<p>During The Phase II Prototype Implementation Phase, the six submissions selected under Phase I will test their solutions, utilizing data from 300 or more adults (aged 18 and above) residing in the US or its territories. During this phase there will be an opportunity for HBD Challenge participants to incorporate data from existing surveys including the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).</p>
<p>Phase II (Prototype Implementation) allows applicants to test proposals developed in Phase I. The prototype is a demonstration of possible methods for supplementing data from existing surveillance systems (such as the BRFSS). This prototype is not meant to be merged with existing surveillance systems, but rather to complement data collected with current infrastructures. At the end of implementation HBD Challenge participants should be able to:</p>
<ol> <li>Compare data obtained by the prototype to data from the BRFSS in the areas of nutrition, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and/or sleep.</li> <li>Demonstrate how data from the included participants could be stratified by demographics (age, sex, education, etc.).</li> <li>Demonstrate the ease of adding additional types of mobile applications and wearable devices to existing survey methodologies.</li> <li>Report that describes the prototype/methodology and the prototype&rsquo;s anticipated strengths and limitations for surveillance.</li> <li>Demonstrate the applicability of the non-traditional data source(s) for ongoing public health surveillance purposes.</li> <li>Describe the prototype in detail, including purpose, method, outcomes and comparability to data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).</li> <li>Provide a working prototype including data (in Excel format) obtained using the prototype from 300 or more adult respondents residing in the US or its territories. The data must include the age, gender, location, and at least one of the measures associated with the HBD Challenge in the areas of nutrition, physical activity, sedentary behaviors and/or sleep.</li> <li>Provide a PowerPoint presentation to the judges and invited CDC personnel which includes information on the purpose, methods, outcomes and comparability to the BRFSS.</li> </ol>
