REGISTRATION: Â </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration for this event will be accomplished online at the following linkÂ </span><a href="http://open.gsa.gov/EarthDayHackathon/">http://open.gsa.gov/EarthDayHackathon/</a>,Â <span style="font-weight: 400;">and shall remain open until Tuesday, April 19, 2016, (11:59 p.m. EST).</span><b> Â </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event space is limited to the first 200 people; once registration is complete you shall receive a confirmation email. Â Only </span><b>1</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ticket is allowed per person, if more than </span><b>1</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ticket is selected, the registration will be cancelled and the individual will need to submit their registration again.</span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">All participants are required to check in with Security upon arriving at the GSA Central Office Building, 1800 F Street NW, Washington, DC. Â A Government issued ID shall be required to gain access into the Building. Â Once through Security follow the posted signs to Conference Center Rooms 1459, 1460, and 1461. Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants are required to stop at the on-site Registration table to sign the required form : Gratuitous Service Agreement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>    <b>2. DETAILS OF CHALLENGE: Â </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design and create a digital interactive solution in the form of an application, application programming interface (API), and/or data mashup that utilizes federal data collected. Â The technology solution should be innovative! Â GSA does not want an analysis tool that tells what is already known, rather they should be forward-thinking solutions that enhance transparency. Â </span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution should accomplish two tasks:</span>  &lt;ol&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visually display or transmit data in a way that will enhance the way federal government works; and Â </span>&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Â  Â  I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dentify relationships through the analysis of the data, if they exist, while providing valuable insights that could be gained through improved data collection efforts.</span>&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  <b>3. DATA: Â </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants will be provided all final project ideas, existing code, and publicly available datasets in advance of the event. Â Event information will be posted on the following page,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span><a href="http://open.gsa.gov/EarthDayHackathon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://open.gsa.gov/EarthDayHackathon/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and will be updated as necessary.</span>    <b>SKILLSETS DESIRED:</b>  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Database Coding (e.g., SQL language)</span>&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Experience using Data Visualization software (e.g. Tableau, MicroStrategy, etc.)</span>&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Web and Application Developers</span>&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">User Experience (UX) Designers</span>&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Scientists</span>&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  <b>4. PRIZES: Â </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">GSA may award prizes of no more than $1,000 to each member of a winning team (3 teamâ€™s total).Â  GSA is not required to award all prizes if the judges determine that a smaller number of entries meet the scope and requirements laid out for this competition, or if the agency only plans to use code from a smaller number of entries.Â  </span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding for this Government-wide Earth Day Hackathon will come from GSA. Â Prizes will be awarded to each member of a winning team via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), within 60 days of announcing the winner(s).Â  </span>    <b>5. ELIGIBILITY</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â : Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligibility to participate in the Government-wide Earth Day Hackathon and win a prize is limited to entities/individuals:</span>  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;That have registered to participate in the competition and complied with the rules of the competition as explained in this posting; and&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">That have been incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States, and in the case of an individual, whether participating singly or in a group, the participant must be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States.</span>&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants may not be a federal entity or federal employee acting within the scope of employment. Â However, an individual or entity shall not be deemed ineligible to win prize money because the individual or entity used federal facilities or consulted with federal employees during a competition if the facilities and employees are made available to all individuals and entities participating in the competition on an equitable basis.</span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants agree to assume any and all risks and waive claims against the federal government and its related entities, except in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue, or profits, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising from participation in this competition, whether the injury, death, damage, or loss arose through negligence or otherwise. Â Entrants are not required to obtain liability insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility in order to participate in this Hackathon.Â Â Â Â Â Â </span>    As the Federal GovernmentÂ is under a strict duty not to give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual, participants must agree to take diligent care to avoid the appearance of Federal Government endorsement of competition participation and submission. Â Participants must agree not to refer to to the Federal Governmentâ€™sÂ use of your submission (be it product or service) in any commercial advertising or similar promotions in a manner that could reasonably imply (in the judgment of a reasonable person) that the GSA or the Federal Government endorses, prefers, sponsors, or has an affiliation with participantsâ€™ products or services. Â Participants agree that GSAâ€™s trademarks, logos, service marks, trade names, or the fact that GSA awarded a prize to a participant, shall not be used by the participant to imply direct GSA endorsement of participant or participantâ€™s submission. Â Both participants and GSA may list the other partyâ€™s name in a publicly available customer or other list so long as the name is not displayed in a more prominent fashion than any other third-party name.    <b>6. REQUIREMENTS: Â </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final solution should be open source code and placed on a GSA site to be specified to participants the day of the event. â€œOpen sourceâ€ refers to a program in which the source code is available to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design free of charge. Â In order to be Open Source Initiative Certified, the solution must meet the following ten criteria:</span>  &lt;ol&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> The author or holder of the license of the source code cannot collect royalties on the distribution of the program.</span>&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> The distributed program must make the source code accessible to the user.</span>&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> The author must allow modifications and derivations of the work under the programâ€™s original name.</span>&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> No person, group, or field of endeavor can be denied access to the program.</span>&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program being part of a particular software distribution.</span>&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> The licensed software cannot place restrictions on other software that is distributed with it.</span>&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> The solution must be an online, interactive solution that meets the goals and objectives provided in this document.</span>&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â The solution must include documentation of all data sources used.</span>&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â The solution must include a description of how the solution can be updated with additional data from other agencies.</span>&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â The solver must provide recommendations to enhance Government insights through improvement in data collection.</span>&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The winner(s) of the competition will, in consideration of the prize(s) to be awarded, grant to GSA a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use any and all intellectual property to the winning entry for any governmental purpose, including the right to permit such use by any other agency or agencies of the federal government. Â All other rights of the winning entrant will be retained by the winner of the competition. Â </span>    <b>7. SCOPE: Â </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any federal data and information that is publicly available is included in the scope of this challenge.
