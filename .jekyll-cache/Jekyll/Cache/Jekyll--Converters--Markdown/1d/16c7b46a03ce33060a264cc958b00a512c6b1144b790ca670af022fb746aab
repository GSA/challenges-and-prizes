<p>The judging panel will consider each submissionâ€™s alignment with each of these criteria and make recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary will select as semifinalists those submissions that best advance the purposes of the Challenge.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>TECHNICAL MERIT:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Innovation</strong>. Submission advances the state of the practice in meeting the needs of users with one or more disabilities (physical, sensory, and/or cognitive)</li>
      <li><strong>Technical Detail and Understanding</strong>. Submission demonstrates an understanding of the problem/engineering need being met as well as limitations.</li>
      <li><strong>User-Driven</strong>. Submission demonstrates user-driven design and incorporates direct input from relevant communities.</li>
      <li><strong>Team</strong>. Submission describes the teamâ€™s composition including disability and industry advisors and how the teamâ€™s background supports the solution development.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PRODUCTION FEASIBILITY:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Production Integration</strong>. Submission describes how the solution can be integrated into a production vehicle, as original equipment or as an aftermarket modification, including scalability, ease of integration, and market readiness.</li>
      <li><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong>. Submission identifies possible risks and challenges and how to overcome them.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety Considerations</strong>. Submission clearly describes the individualâ€™s/teamâ€™s approach to ensuring the safety of occupants and other road users.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost and Other Adoption Considerations</strong>.

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>IMPACT/BENEFIT:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inclusivity</strong>. Submission demonstrates inclusivity in vehicle design and engineering, laying a foundation for future automated vehicles that can be used by people with physical, sensory, and cognitive disabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Potential Benefit</strong>. Submission describes potential benefit to one or more target user(s) or demonstrates the potential for users, should the solution be developed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
