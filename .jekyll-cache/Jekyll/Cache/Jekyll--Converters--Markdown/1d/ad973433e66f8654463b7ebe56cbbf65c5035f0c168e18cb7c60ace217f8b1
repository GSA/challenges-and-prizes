I"<p><strong><span lang="EN">Phase 1:&nbsp; Concept Paper Evaluation Criteria </span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN">NIST makes an independent assessment of each concept paper based on the evaluation criteria. NIST will not review or consider incomplete concept papers. During the review, each SME and member of the Judging panel will review entire concept papers to which they are assigned. The review is not done in sections with different reviewers responsible for different assigned sections, therefore, it is not necessary to repeat information in every part of the concept paper. Contestants must use non-confidential terms in their concept papers.&nbsp; Do not include in the concept paper or otherwise submit information deemed to be proprietary, private, trade secret, or in any way confidential</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Concept Paper Evaluation Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN">Criterion 1:&nbsp; Strategic Alignment &amp; Technical Outcome (70%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">This criterion involves consideration of the following factors:</span></p>
<ul> <li>Strategic Alignment:&nbsp; The extent to which the proposed approach meets the objectives listed in the goals of the Challenge (to assess the potential of the SIM Card as a secure storage container for public safety application credentials; to develop a mobile application that utilizes a credential, provisioned to the SIM card; authenticate to a third-party service provider); the understanding of requirements for interacting with the SIM card to provision information; the discussion of standards-based interfaces for writing to and reading from the SIM card.</li> <li>Technical Outcome:&nbsp; The extent to which the proposed approach provides a plan for the contestant to successfully complete both Phases 2 and 3 of the Challenge, producing a proof of concept implementation that can drive Public Safety Broadband Network innovation.</li> </ul>
<p><em><span lang="EN">Criterion 2:&nbsp; Feasibility &amp; Team (30%)</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">This criterion involves consideration of the following factors:</span></p>
<ul> <li>Team:&nbsp; The extent to which the capability of the contestant can address all aspects of the proposed project with a high chance of success, including, but not limited to, qualifications, relevant expertise, and time commitment of the contestants. Reviewers will evaluate:&nbsp; (a) The relevance of the qualifications and experience of the key staff, leadership, and technical experts. (b) The extent of the contestant&rsquo;s prior experience and the quality of the results achieved in leading programs similar in nature to the purpose, scope, etc.</li> <li>Approach:&nbsp; Contestant&rsquo;s plan to manage the limited schedule, required materials and resources, project risks and other issues, and produce high quality project outcomes, in pursuit of the Challenge goals (to collaborate and advance the state of mobile device security for public safety).</li> </ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Concept papers will be evaluated based on the criteria above. Each concept paper will be reviewed by at least two SMEs and the Judging panel members and will be assigned a score for each criterion, 0-10 for each criterion. Scores will not be provided to the contestants. In the case of a tie, the Judging panel will decide on the winners invited to compete in Phase 2.</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Scoring for Concept Papers</span></strong></p>
<p>10:&nbsp; Contestant has strong potential to aid in the achievement of the goals of the challenge</p>
<p>1-9:&nbsp; Varying degrees of certainty the contestant may have the potential to aid in the achievement of the goals of the challenge</p>
<p>0:&nbsp; Contestant does not have the potential to aid in the achievement of the goals of the challenge</p>
