<p><strong><u>Registration Process for Participants</u></strong>: The Challenge launches on December 29, 2016. The initial round of the Challenge will take the form of local competitions that will be run across the country beginning no earlier than December 29, 2016 and ending no later than June¬†3, 2017 by host organizations such as universities, accelerators, clusters, scale-up communities, and SBA Resource Partners. For more information regarding these local competitions as it becomes available, please visit <a href="https://www.sba.gov/offices/headquarters/wbo/resources/1465581">sba.gov/InnovateHER</a>. SBA will continue to update the list of local competitions as details are confirmed. While these local competitions will be identified as part of the InnovateHER Challenge and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with these Challenge Rules, they will be administered solely by the local host organizations and will be judged by individuals selected by each host in their sole discretion. At a minimum, however, each application must contain a business plan covering the contestant‚Äôs proposed product or service and must satisfy the Challenge criteria outlined in the Challenge description.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Each host organization is responsible for preparing the complete nomination package</span>, including obtaining a copy of the relevant business plan from the winner and ensuring that the full package is submitted timely to the SBA via the ‚ÄúSubmit Solution‚Äù tab on the left. (If you‚Äôd like to serve as an InnovateHER Host Organization, you must send a written request to the SBA via <a href="mailto:womenbusiness@sba.gov">womenbusiness@sba.gov</a> by no later than April 19, 2017 including the information outlined in the Challenge description.)</p>

<p>Following the completion of the local competitions, each host organization will identify one winner that will advance to the semi-final round of the Challenge. For a winning entry that has been submitted by a team of competitors, the host organization must list the team‚Äôs self-identified project leader as the winner who will advance to the semi-final round. No later than June¬†23, 2017, each host organization will submit a nomination package to <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">www.Challenge.gov</a> containing the winning individual/team‚Äôs business plan and other required information to SBA, which will administer the semi-final and final rounds of the Challenge. Selection as a semi-finalist following a local competition is the only means of registering for the Challenge. All nominations will be screened by SBA for eligibility. Contestants cannot submit entries directly to SBA.</p>
