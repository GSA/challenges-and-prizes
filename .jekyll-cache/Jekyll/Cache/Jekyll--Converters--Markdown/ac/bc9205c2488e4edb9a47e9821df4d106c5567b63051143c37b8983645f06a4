I"<p>We need your help to combat illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing around the world.  Those who engage in IUU fishing circumvent conservation and management measures, avoid costs associated with sustainable fishing practices, and derive economic benefit from exceeding harvesting limits.  By applying innovative analytic techniques, this algorithm development challenge seeks to develop a process, available to all, to more effectively identify and thereby enable authorities to react to the global IUU fishing threat.</p>
