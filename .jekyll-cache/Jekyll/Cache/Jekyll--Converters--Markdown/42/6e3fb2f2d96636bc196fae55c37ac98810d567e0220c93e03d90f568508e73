I"·<p>All Phase 1 submissions shall be clearly marked Company Name - ID3-AStRA 2021-Tech Paper. Only UNCLASSIFIED submittals will be accepted. The Government does not intend to publish any questions or comments received because of this announcement. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.  The evaluation process for Phase 1 will be conducted using technical SME reviewers. Each five-page technical white paper and optional video will be evaluated based on the technical merit, relevance, and ROM cost as it relates to the problem statement and evaluation factors stated herein and attached rather than against other submittals. Submittals submitted in response to this solicitation will be evaluated using the attached evaluation criteria guide and as outlined below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal (minimum 3 pages).</li>
  <li>How it aligns and proposes to solve the problem statement.</li>
  <li>Technical benefit. Operational Impact. Warfighter Demand.</li>
  <li>TRL. Current TRL of the technology and/or product and what is required in testing by the Government for the proposed technology or product to be incorporated into a defense system or military program. The U.S. Army seeks a TRL goal of 7 - 9 for exit and plans to fund selected winners with BA 6.5. (In circumstances of exceptional technical merit, proposals with a lower TRL rating may be considered for award at a later date.)</li>
  <li>Base technology, prototype objectives, deliverables, activities, artifacts, demonstrations.</li>
  <li>Schedule: The degree to which the proposed POP schedule is achievable within a 36 month or earlier from award.</li>
  <li>ROM Cost: Whether the proposed ROM is realistic and affordable for the proposed technical approach to the extent appropriate. The price is ONLY a ROM for general awareness and for gauging the magnitude of the solution submitted. It is not a request for a formal nor detailed cost proposal. All formal cost proposals will be requested separately at the Governmentâ€™s discretion upon an invitation to provide proposals from RCCTO Contracting Center in accordance with Army acquisition processes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both the Five-page Technical White Papers (and optional video) and the Oral Proposal/Technology Pitch will be evaluated and ranked using attached evaluation criteria guidelines with the following scoring weights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scientific/Technical Merit â€“ 30%</li>
  <li>Potential Contributions to the Army Mission â€“ 35%</li>
  <li>Technology Readiness Level  â€“ 20%</li>
  <li>Schedule Feasibility &amp; Achievability â€“ 5%</li>
  <li>Cost/Price â€“ 10%</li>
  <li>Quality of Submission â€“ Evaluated, but not weighted â€“ 0%</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon conclusion of the Technical White Paper (and optional video) evaluation period, the Government will make selections of the best technical solutions to receive an invitation to Phase 2: Technology Pitches, tentatively scheduled for the week of 28 June 2021.  The organizations that conduct the Phase 2 Technology Pitch will receive the $5,000 prize.  The best technical and most highly rated proposals from Phase 2 will be invited to submit final proposal submittals for a final evaluation prior to award.</p>
