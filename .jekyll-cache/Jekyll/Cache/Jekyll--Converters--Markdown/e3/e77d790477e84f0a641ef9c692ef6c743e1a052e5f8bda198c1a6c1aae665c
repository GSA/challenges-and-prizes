I"È<h3><strong><u>Eligibility</u></strong><strong>:</strong></h3>
<p>To compete in the Campus RainWorks Challenge, student teams must be affiliated with a degree-granting public or private institution of higher education located in the U.S. and be sponsored by a faculty advisor. All team members must be enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate degree program¬†at an eligible college or university as of August 31, 2017.  &lt;h3&gt;<strong><u>Submission Categories</u>:</strong>&lt;/h3&gt;  To encourage participating teams to assess the environmental, economic, and social benefits of green infrastructure at a range of spatial scales, EPA is accepting submissions in two design categories:  &lt;h4&gt;<strong>Demonstration Project Category</strong>&lt;/h4&gt;  For submissions in the Demonstration Project category, EPA is seeking proof-of-concept level designs that examine how green infrastructure could be integrated into a particular site on the team‚Äôs campus to meet multiple environmental, educational, and economic objectives. Entries in this category should include detailed information on the design and performance of the proposed demonstration project, and should reflect extensive consultation with the facilities planning department to assess project feasibility.  &lt;h4&gt;<strong>Master Plan Category</strong>&lt;/h4&gt;  For submissions in the Master Plan category, EPA is seeking conceptual designs that examine how green infrastructure could be integrated into a broad area of the team‚Äôs campus. Entries in this category should be coordinated with existing campus master plans and should describe how green infrastructure could be used to enhance the long-term sustainability of the campus.  &lt;h4&gt;<strong>Submission Requirements  </strong>&lt;/h4&gt;  To compete in EPA‚Äôs Campus RainWorks Challenge, registered teams must submit the following which describe an innovative green infrastructure project for a location on their campus:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;One (1) Project Narrative&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;One (1) Design Board&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;One (1) Video Pitch&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;One (1) Letter of Support&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Submissions should provide detailed information of sufficient quality to enable the judges to evaluate the design. Submissions should describe overall project goals, how the project fits within the context of the campus or watershed, existing conditions along with the problem to be solved, proposed green infrastructure approaches, and expected outcomes.  &lt;h4&gt;<strong>Project Narrative</strong>&lt;/h4&gt;  The intent of the project narrative is to provide a summary of each team‚Äôs approach to meeting the challenge criteria.  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Each team must prepare a project narrative not to exceed twelve (12) 8.5‚Äù x 11‚Äù pages (including images, graphics, and tables; excluding cover page, abstract, and an additional allowance of two pages for calculations and references only). Note that additional pages will not be reviewed. Pages should be consecutively numbered with 1‚Äù margins, and text should be single-spaced in standard 12-point font. Headings may be larger than 12-point font; text labels for graphics or images may be smaller than 12-point font; page numbers may be outside of the 1‚Äù margin.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The project narrative must include a cover page. The cover page must display the team‚Äôs registration number, project title, names and academic majors of team members, and the name and academic department of the team‚Äôs faculty advisor. The cover page must also include a project abstract of no more than 250 words.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Teams must provide an electronic copy of the project narrative in Adobe Acrobat¬Æ PDF format. Instructions on submitting deliverables are provided below.<strong>  </strong>&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;<strong>Design Board</strong>&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The intent of the design board is to provide a visual understanding of the site context, design elements, and design performance.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The design board must focus on visual elements and limit the amount of text. The design board should supplement, not duplicate, graphics within the project narrative.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Each team must prepare one 24‚Äù x 36‚Äù design board. The design board must include the team‚Äôs registration number (see Registration section) in the upper right hand corner.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The design board must include a site plan. Additional elements might include cross sections, conceptual drawings, or graphics representing anticipated benefits.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Teams must provide an electronic copy of the design board in Adobe Acrobat¬Æ PDF format. Submission instructions are provided below.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;<strong>Video Pitch</strong>&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Each team must prepare a video pitch about the project not to exceed 3 minutes. Videos longer than 3 minutes will not be viewed.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The video pitch should be persuasive in illustrating the potential environmental, economic, and social benefits of the project.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The video pitch could include, but is not limited to: a tour of the potential site; discussion of design components; interviews with team members, faculty or industry practitioners; or financing options. Content and style are at the discretion of the student team. Creativity and enthusiasm are encouraged and appreciated.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Teams must upload their video pitch to YouTube or a similar video-sharing website and provide a link with their submission (see submission instructions). Videos should be set as ‚Äúunlisted‚Äù or ‚Äúprivate‚Äù so that entries cannot be detected by search engines prior to the submission deadline. Once the submission deadline has passed, teams should set their videos to ‚Äúpublic‚Äù.¬† See below for instructions on uploading project videos to YouTube and setting videos as ‚ÄúUnlisted‚Äù on YouTube:&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop">How to upload a video on YouTube</a>&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?hl=en">How to change a video‚Äôs privacy settings on YouTube</a>&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;<strong>Letter of Support</strong>&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The intent of the letter of support is to demonstrate consultation with the college or university‚Äôs facilities planning department to develop a feasible design. Each team must submit a letter from a member of the college or university‚Äôs facilities planning department demonstrating support for the proposed design.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The letter does not count against the 12 page limit of the Project Narrative. Letters of support are not to exceed two 8.5‚Äù by 11‚Äù pages. Note that pages in excess of two will not be reviewed.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The letter must be on appropriate letterhead. Additionally, the letter must be signed by a member of the facilities planning department, and include the registration number and project title.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The letter must be provided in Adobe Acrobat PDF format. Instructions on submitting project files are provided below.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;</p>
