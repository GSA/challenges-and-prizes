I"Z<p><strong>Judging and Scoring for Final Prizes</strong></p>
<p>NIST staff or their delegates will review entries based on the Certification Process and Final Review Process. A submission that fails to meet the compliance criteria will be ineligible to win prizes in this contest. Submissions that pass the final compliance review will be scored based on accuracy during a sequestered evaluation:&nbsp; the submitter's code will be run against a blind (sequestered) dataset and similarity metrics will be computed between analytics results on the synthetic privatized set and the original dataset.</p>
