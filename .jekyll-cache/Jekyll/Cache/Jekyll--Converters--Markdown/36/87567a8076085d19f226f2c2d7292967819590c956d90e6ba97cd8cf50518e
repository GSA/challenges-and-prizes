I"Õ<p>The Seeker requires a scientifically-based taxonomy that can uniquely describe any space object with a minimal set of attributes that can be used to accurately predict space object behavior as verified and validated by actual sensor measurements.    The increasing number of satellites being launched combined with a growing number of on-orbit collisions could lead to hazards for all space users.Â  Space objects often do not appear where they are projected to be based on the physical characteristics and dynamic models of space objects currently used.Â  The Seeker requires a scientifically-based taxonomy that can uniquely describe any space object with a minimal set of attributes (e.g. mathematical basis of parameters) that can be used to accurately predict space object behavior as verified and validated by actual sensor measurements.Â  However, the aim is not to introduce a random grouping, but to derive a taxonomy of minimal salient parameters corresponding to actual physical and behavioral (for example, dynamic) attributes.    This is a Theoretical Challenge that requires only a written proposal to be submitted.Â  The Challenge award will be contingent upon theoretical evaluation of the proposal by the Seeker.</p>
