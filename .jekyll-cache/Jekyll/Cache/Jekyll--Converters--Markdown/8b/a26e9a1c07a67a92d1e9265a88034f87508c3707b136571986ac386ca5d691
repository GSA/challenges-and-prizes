<p>One in seven mothers experiences a postpartum mental health condition. Rural women and families face barriers to accessing adequate care for postpartum mental health problems. Such barriers may include limited availability of mental health care providers, and difficulties arranging for child care, transportation, and payment.</p>

<p>The purposes of this challenge are to (1) amplify innovative programs that rural communities already are implementing to address challenges to postpartum mental health diagnosis and treatment and (2) elicit new solutions. AHRQ plans to share the winning solutions with rural communities, healthcare systems, healthcare professionals, local and state policy makers, federal partners, and the public.</p>

<p>This challenge is a single-phase competition with two categories: success stories and proposals. <strong>Success stories</strong> will highlight community achievements and <strong>new program proposals</strong> will demonstrate innovative planning for community action to improve postpartum mental health. Applicants may only submit a proposal in one category</p>

<p>Submissions are due in September and you need only a 5 or 10 page description of your innovative idea that meets the <a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/rural-post-partum-challenge/how-to-enter.html" target="_blank">submission requirements</a> and review criteria (<a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/rural-post-partum-challenge/category1.html" target="_blank">success story</a> or <a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/rural-post-partum-challenge/category2.html" target="_blank">program proposal</a>).</p>
