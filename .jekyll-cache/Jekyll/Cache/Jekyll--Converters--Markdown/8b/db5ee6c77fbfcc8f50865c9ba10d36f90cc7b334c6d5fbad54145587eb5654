I"%<p>The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (<a href="https://www.cdfifund.gov/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">CDFI Fund</a>) plays an important role in generating economic growth and opportunity in some of our nation’s most distressed communities. By offering tailored resources and innovative programs that invest federal dollars alongside private sector capital, the CDFI Fund serves mission-driven financial institutions that take a market-based approach to supporting economically disadvantaged communities.    The FY 2016 CDFI Fund Prize Competition seeks to stimulate innovation that will build capacity to expand CDFI investments and increase access to capital in underserved rural areas, particularly those that are characterized by persistent poverty. The CDFI Fund will reward selected applicants with monetary prizes, totaling up to $1,000,000, for innovative proposals that (1) identify and promote new ideas and practices, thereby facilitating their implementation by CDFIs that serve rural areas, and/or (2) create value during and after the competition by encouraging CDFIs that serve rural areas to develop new skills or practices that may have beneficial effects on the rural areas they serve.    The CDFI Fund envisions there will be two types of applicants:  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;An innovative idea or strategy, implemented within the past two years, that helped increase CDFI investments and access to capital in underserved rural areas; or&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;An innovative idea or strategy that <em>has not yet been implemented</em>, but is reasonably expected to increase CDFI investments and access to capital in underserved rural areas.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Judges will select the winning entries according to judging criteria. <strong>Please click on the following link to view the evaluation criteria: <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FY2016-CDFI-Fund-Prize-Evaluation-Criteria-FINAL-6.23.16.pdf" target="_blank">FY2016 CDFI Fund Prize Evaluation Criteria</a></strong>. The CDFI Fund may choose to distribute the prize in one or more payments. In addition, the CDFI Fund may require prize awardees to submit reports detailing progress implementing the proposed solution and/or any outcomes.    Judges may also select entries for Honorable Mention based on the judging criteria in order to highlight and promote success stories and best practices.  Applicants listed as Honorable Mention will not be awarded a financial prize. The Winning Entries, and Honorable Mention applicants, will be recognized on the contest and CDFI Fund websites. The CDFI Fund may invite contest winners and honorable mention applicants to participate in post-award events or communications.    For purposes of this competition, a “rural area” is defined as a county or counties that are considered non-Metropolitan Areas under the CDFI Program’s regulations (12 CFR 1805.104). An area that is characterized by “persistent poverty” is defined as any county or Native community that has had 20 percent or more of its population living in poverty over the past 30 years, as measured by the 1990, 2000, and 2010 decennial censuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; <strong>Please click on the following link to view the Rural Area and Persistent Poverty Lookup Tables: <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CDFI-Fund-Prize-Challenge-Rural-and-PPC-Lookup-FINAL-7.21.16.xlsx">CDFI Fund Prize Challenge Rural and PPC Lookup </a>.  </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Please note: the Rural Area and Persistent Poverty Lookup Tables have been updated as of July 21, 2016 to include eligible areas for the U.S. Territories based upon alternative census data other than the decennial census due to data limitations.</strong></span>    The CDFI Fund’s definition of a “Native Community” is an American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian community. The CDFI Fund uses the Office of Management and Budget’s definitions of “American Indian or Alaska Native” and “Native Hawaiian”: “American Indian or Alaska Native” refers to “a person who has origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment,” and “Native Hawaiian” refers to “a person having origins in the original peoples of Hawaii”.
