<p>Technical reviewers with expertise relevant to the Challenge will evaluate the Solutions based on their ability to achieve the criteria listed below. The Solutions and evaluation statements from the technical panel will then be reviewed by federal employees serving as judges, who will select up to five (5) Challenge winners, subject to a final decision by the Award Approving Official.</p>
<p><strong>Basis Upon Which Solutions Will Be Evaluated</strong></p>
<p>This challenge aims to encourage and reward innovative adult heart failure disease modeling. These computational models will help create heart failure research paradigms that drive discovery and new treatment approaches. Successful Solutions of sub-phenotyping schema will facilitate hypothesis development and study design in the basic and/or clinical research communities. For example, an adult heart failure sub-phenotyping scheme incorporating large genomic and imaging datasets could reveal new insights into the mechanism of disease. It could also refine adult heart failure diagnoses, and identify subgroups of adult heart failure patients for personalized treatment. The Solution should address the following judging criteria from the NHLBI. The points assigned to each set of evaluation criteria suggest which scientific milestones interest the Institute and warrant emphasis.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation Criterion 1:&nbsp; Impact and Innovation (15 points)</strong></p>
<ul> <li>To what extent has the Solution brought together NHLBI-funded (or other, if used) biomedical health datasets, using an approach that is novel and innovative to adult heart failure research?</li> <li>How high is the likelihood that the Solution will have major impact in the field of adult heart failure research? How significantly might the Solution change the concepts, methods, and/or technologies that drive this field?</li> <li>Where applicable, to what extent do the datasets used to develop the Solution include data from diverse participants (including ethnicity, race, gender, and/or age)?</li> <li>To what extent have the Participants demonstrated why/how the Solution could provide new insights in the field of heart failure research compared to existing adult heart failure phenotyping models?</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Evaluation Criterion 2:&nbsp;  Functionality and Implementation (30 points) </strong></p>
<ul> <li>How well documented is the approach for developing the Solution? To what extent will it be possible for other researchers to reproduce/validate the development of the sub-phenotyping scheme?</li> <li>To what extent are datasets that serve as the basis of the Solution rigorously generated and relevant to the field of heart failure research?</li> <li>To what degree of success has the utility of the sub-phenotyping scheme been validated in independent datasets?</li> <li>To what extent was the sub-phenotyping scheme developed with open-source codes/packages versus commercial software packages?</li> <li>To what extent has the Solution utilized NHLBI-funded biomedical health datasets?</li> <li>How well can the Solution identify phenotypic categories that may be associated with various adult heart failure events or outcomes and/or subsets of adult heart failure patients? </li> <li>How well can the sub-phenotyping scheme clearly delineate among the identified adult heart failure phenotype classifications?</li> <li>To what degree can the Solution provide additional context for investigation of basic and/or clinical heart failure research questions?</li> <li>How well have the Participants demonstrated the ability of the proposed Solution to provide sufficient information necessary for the development of research approaches and/or research tools in basic and/or clinical research settings? </li> <li>To what degree have the Participants described a model for sub-phenotyping adult heart failure that is an easy-to-use, free, and publicly accessible tool for the basic and/or clinical heart failure research community?</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Evaluation Criterion 3:&nbsp; Applied Expertise (5 points)</strong></p>
<ul> <li>How well have the Participants demonstrated that appropriate expertise was utilized to develop the Solution?</li> <li>To what extent have the Participants brought together cross-disciplinary expertise? </li> <li>How well have the Participants integrated their relevant expertise in the development of the Solution?</li> </ul>
