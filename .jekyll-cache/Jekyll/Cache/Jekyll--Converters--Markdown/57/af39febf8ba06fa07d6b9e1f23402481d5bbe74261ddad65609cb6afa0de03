<p>Every few months it feels like there&rsquo;s some new revolutionary thing that can be done with a smartphone, but smartphones are just one small part of the unprecedented advancements in our lives. &nbsp;Combine things such as augmented reality displays with the vast amounts of information we&rsquo;re collecting about our world, and you can help transform technology used by Public Safety and First Responders. &nbsp;This Prize Challenge will help the PSCR (Public Safety Communications Research) team champion its mission and inspire the American public to make the world a safer place.</p>
<p><strong><u>Project</u></strong><strong><u>&nbsp;Objectiv</u></strong><strong><u>es:</u></strong> Your challenge with this project is to create a series of seven (7) Videos to explain "Open Innovation" and NIST&rsquo;s "Public Safety Communications Research Open Innovation Accelerator" to the public. &nbsp;The videos you create will be an invitation to people and companies across America to participate in crowdsourcing competitions with PSCR while describing the key public safety technology programs at PSCR. Your driving motivation should be to &ldquo;<em>excite and inform!</em>&rdquo; with the key guidelines of creating content that feels aspirational, futuristic and inclusive.&nbsp;Be innovative and think creatively to find ways of designing something unique. It&rsquo;s also important to note that the individual Videos may require slightly different approaches, so pay close attention to each requirement.</p>
<p><strong>For your <u>Concepts</u> and <u>Pitches</u></strong>, think about the method that will be used to communicate PSCR's information, and the inspirational theme or creative presentation of information that might make it unique and engaging. Think about how the Videos might be structured, and how or who might deliver the message. Will you challenge the viewer, or try to pique their curiosity? Will you be flashy, or minimalistic and focused? Answer the questions, &ldquo;What makes this relevant? What inspires action?&rdquo;</p>
