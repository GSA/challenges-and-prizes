I"½<p>You will first have to create an account on Kaggle.com</p>

<p>You can select up to 2 submissions to be used to calculate your final leaderboard score. If 2 submissions are not selected, they will be chosen based on your best submission scores on the public leaderboard.</p>

<p>Your final score will not be based on the same exact subset of data as the public leaderboard, but rather a different private data subset of your full submission â€”your public score is only a rough indication of what your final score is.</p>

<p>You should thus choose submissions that will most likely be best overall, and not necessarily on the public subset.</p>

<p>You may submit algorithms on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-fisheries-steller-sea-lion-population-count/submit">Submit Predictions</a>Â page. You may have up to 5 submissions per day.</p>
