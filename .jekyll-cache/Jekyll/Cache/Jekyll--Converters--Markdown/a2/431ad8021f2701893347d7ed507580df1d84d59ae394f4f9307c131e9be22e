<p><strong>About Lyme and Other Tickborne Diseases in the United States</strong></p>

<p>In 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) used insurance records to estimate that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/humancases.html">approximately 476,000 Americans are diagnosed and treated</a> for Lyme disease every year. Tick-borne diseases, including Lyme disease, are increasing in number, and expanding to new areas in the United States. According to the CDC, domestic cases of tick-borne diseases have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dvbd/pdf/Brochure_National_Framework_VBDs-P.pdf">more than doubled from 2004 to 2018</a>. The development and survival of ticks, their animal hosts (such as deer), and the bacterium that causes Lyme disease are all <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/pubs/VECTOR-BORNE-DISEASE-Final_508.pdf">strongly influenced by climatic factors</a>, especially temperature, precipitation, and humidity.</p>
