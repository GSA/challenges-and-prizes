I"GY<p><strong>Introduction</strong>    The Library of Congress sponsors this legislative data challenge to advance the discovery, use, and exploration of the collection of legislative information the Library offers to the nation and the world through the website Congress.gov.    Presented in cooperation with the United States Congress and the Government Publishing Office, Congress.gov offers the public a rich collection of documents about the legislative process of the United States, including bills and laws, Congressional rules, calendars and journals, and records of Congressional hearings and meetings.    <strong>The purpose of this challenge is to encourage the development of tools, methods, and materials that help American citizens and the rest of the world discover, access, and analyze Congress.gov information in new ways.</strong>    Increased exploration of the Congress.gov collection will benefit students of all ages, the business, scientific, and academic communities, historians, and anyone interested in American government, law, and policy-making.  The lessons learned from identifying innovative ways to deliver large amounts of data via the web will benefit the Library as the steward of a universal collection intended to document the history and culture of America and the world.   Having constituents who are engaged in the legislative process and informed about policy choices will benefit Members of Congress in their representative function.  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong>Sponsor. </strong>The challenge is sponsored by the Library of Congress, 101 Independence Avenue, S.E., Washington, DC  20540.   In these Official Rules, “we” and “our” refer to the Library.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong>Brief Description. </strong>A variety of legislative data is available on the Congress.gov website. We are sponsoring a challenge to enhance the use and analysis of this legislative data. The challenge is to create a new application, website, visualization, or other digital creation that helps discover, access, or analyze the legislative data available on Congress.gov in new ways.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<strong>Eligibility.</strong>  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;You may participate in the challenge if you are:  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;At least 18 years old at the time of entry, or if you are under the age 18, you are able to submit a release signed by your parent or guardian&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;A team of individuals where each team member is at least 18 years old at the time of entry, or if under the age of 18 the team member is able to submit a release signed by the member’s parent or guardian.

Submissions should take a novel approach to analyzing or visualizing Congressional data or improve an existing method.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<u>Design</u>.
