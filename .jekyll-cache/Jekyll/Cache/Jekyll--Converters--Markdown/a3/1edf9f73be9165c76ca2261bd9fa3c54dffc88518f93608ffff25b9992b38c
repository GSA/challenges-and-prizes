I"ﬁ<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), one of the components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), announces the annual ‚Äú$100,000 for Start a SUD Startup‚Äù Challenge. The Challenge goal is to support research ideas in the area of Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) that are intended to be the foundation for the development of successful new startups. NIDA expects that the Challenge will enable the winners to test the premise that their research idea can be fostered into a biotech startup, and that eventually the newly created startups will contribute to the pool of innovative small business companies that can successfully compete for NIDA‚Äôs Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding.</p>

<p>The Challenge will offer up to ten awards of $10,000 each and technical expertise and mentoring from NIDA biomedical entrepreneurship experts. The Challenge total purse is up to $100,000.</p>

<p><strong><em>Subject of the Challenge</em></strong></p>

<p>NIDA is reissuing this Challenge after confirming its success and popularity within the community. The Challenge is a competition for participants with research ideas in the Substance Use Disorder (SUD) research area that are purposefully intended to be the foundation for the development of new successful biomedical startups. NIDA offers $100,000 conjointly with technical mentoring from NIDA biomedical entrepreneurship experts. NIDA expects that the prize competition will inspire and enable the winners to test the premise that their SUD research idea can be fostered into a biotech startup. This Challenge is unique because NIDA intends to provide prize money and dedicated biomedical entrepreneurial assistance to the ‚Äúwould be‚Äù startup founders much earlier than most investors, incubators, or traditional models of research funding (e.g., small business grants). However, NIDA anticipates that the newly created startups will eventually contribute to the pool of innovative small business companies that can successfully compete for NIDA‚Äôs Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding.</p>

<p>What does it take to participate in the Challenge? The participants must have a research idea directly related to SUD or that could be extended or adopted to be useful for SUD. For a platform technology, the research idea must be broad enough to address multiple conditions, diseases, or indications, including SUD. For example, if the idea would only work for cancer or diabetes, entering this Challenge is not appropriate. However, if the plan is to test an idea for a research tool that would further an understanding of neurobiology or epigenetics relevant to SUD to advance the field faster and with greater fidelity, entering this Challenge is appropriate. The participants must also be interested in creating a startup around their research idea with the goal of creating the startup product for the target customers. Here, the term ‚Äúproduct‚Äù is used in its broadest definition. Product is any source of value for the people who become customers. Services, subscriptions, software as a service (SaaS), physical/tangible products (biomedical devices, drugs, etc.), aggregations, etc. could all provide value and thus be considered startup products. The startup product could be the result of novel scientific discoveries, repurposing an existing technology for a new use, extending a research observation or discovery made in a different scientific field into the SUD area, devising a new business model or distribution/delivery channel that unlocks new value, or simply bringing a product or service to a previously underserved customer.</p>

<p>The potential startup founder must also have the passion, drive, discipline, ability to work collaboratively, and willingness to be coached to push forward under conditions of business uncertainty.</p>

<p>The winners of this Challenge are encouraged and offered training to use the prize money to develop a minimum viable product (MVP), to obtain customer feedback to discover if the MVP meets the customer needs, and to assess the feasibility of science-based small business creation within 6 months post-award. Post Challenge, as with all other NIH grant applicants, NIDA staff will provide technical assistance and guidance about the grant submission process, including how to submit an SBIR/STTR application to NIDA‚Äôs small business programs.</p>

<p><strong><em>Statutory Authority to Conduct the Challenge</em></strong></p>

<p>NIDA is conducting this Challenge under the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science (COMPETES) Reauthorization Act of 2010, as amended [15 U.S.C. ¬ß 3719]. The general purpose of NIDA is to conduct and support biomedical and behavioral research, health-services research, research training, and health information dissemination with respect to the prevention of drug abuse and the treatment of drug abusers. This Challenge is consistent with and advances the mission of NIDA as described in 42 U.S.C. 285o in that it supports biotech startups in the development of research ideas that would further an understanding and management of SUD. As this Challenge is consistent with and advances the mission of NIDA in that it seeks to identify novel strategies to combat drug addiction, any submissions pursuing ideas in the areas of alcohol use disorder and pain will not be accepted.</p>
