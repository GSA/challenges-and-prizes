I"|<p>The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) Design by Biomedical Undergraduate Teams (DEBUT) Challenge is open to teams of undergraduate students working on projects that develop innovative solutions to unmet health and clinical problems. NIBIB&rsquo;s mission is to improve health by leading the development and accelerating the application of biomedical technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goals of the DEBUT Challenge are 1) to provide undergraduate students valuable experiences such as working in teams, identifying unmet clinical needs, and designing, building and debugging solutions for such open-ended problems; 2) to generate novel, innovative tools to improve healthcare, consistent with NIBIB&rsquo;s purpose to support research, training, the dissemination of health information, and other programs with respect to biomedical imaging and engineering and associated technologies and modalities with biomedical applications; and 3) to highlight and acknowledge the contributions and accomplishments of undergraduate students.</p>
<p>The NIBIB DEBUT Challenge solicits design projects that develop innovative solutions to unmet health and clinical problems. Areas of interest for the biomedical engineering projects include, but are not limited to: diagnostics, therapeutics, technologies for underserved populations and low resource settings, point-of-care systems, precision medicine, preventive medicine, technologies to aid individuals with disabilities and HIV/AIDS prevention and care. Student teams participating in capstone design projects are especially encouraged to enter the challenge.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>To support and expand the DEBUT Challenge, the NIBIB has joined forces with VentureWell, a not-for-profit leader in funding, training, coaching and early investment that brings student innovations to market. This public-private partnership on DEBUT, allows student teams to compete for prizes offered by both NIBIB and VentureWell by submitting one application.</p>
<p>Student teams entering the challenge will have the option to have their entries also considered for prizes offered by VentureWell. VentureWell prizes will be selected and awarded by VentureWell following a separate judging process. The rules for the VentureWell prizes and the additional submission components that are required to compete for them can be found at <a href="http://venturewell.org/students/debut/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://venturewell.org/students/debut/guidelines</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Statutory Authority to Conduct the Challenge:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The general purpose of NIBIB is the conduct and support of research, training, the dissemination of health information, and other programs with respect to biomedical imaging, biomedical engineering, and associated technologies and modalities with biomedical applications. NIBIB is conducting this challenge under the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science (COMPETES) Reauthorization Act of 2010, 15 U.S.C. 3719. In line with these authorities, by challenging undergraduate students to identify unmet clinical needs and develop innovative solutions for them, NIBIB targets the education of biomedical engineers who have the background, skills, and confidence to make outstanding contributions to biomedical technologies.&nbsp; Engaging undergraduate students to work in teams to design, build and debug solutions to real-world problems/needs in healthcare, not only prepares them to function effectively in their future work environment, but also yields novel, innovative biomedical tools that can transform healthcare.&nbsp;</p>
