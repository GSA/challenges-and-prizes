<p>In Part 2, the selected winners from Part 1 will present their technology solution live to a panel of Army SMEs, which will include a question-and-answer session.</p>

<p>Details of the presentation submission and evaluation criteria will be provided upon selection for Part 2. Each participant will conduct a live, virtual, closed-door presentation, to include a questionand-answer session, to a panel of Army SMEs. Project representatives will present their technology feasibility and Army impact of their technology, commercialization strategy, and team ability. Each participant will be given the opportunity to justify a Direct to Phase II SBIR award as part of their technology pitch by demonstrating sufficient maturity of their approach to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. A prototype is defined as a model of something to be further developed, which includes designs, protocols, questionnaires, software, and devices. Each participant will have up to twenty (20) minutes to present, followed by up to ten (10) minutes for questions and answers with the Army panel of SMEs.</p>
