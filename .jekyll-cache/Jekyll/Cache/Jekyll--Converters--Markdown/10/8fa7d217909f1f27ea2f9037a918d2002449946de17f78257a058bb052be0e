I"{:<h4>Rules</h4>
<p>The Official Rules are posted at <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ariac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ariac/</a> and the Event Website, <a href="http://www.nist.gov/ariac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.nist.gov/ariac</a>.</p>
<h4>Eligibility to Participate in the Competition:</h4>
<p>Participation in the ARIAC Prize Competition is open to ALL; however, not all participants are eligible to win cash prizes as explained in the next section.</p>
<p>Each Competition Participant (individual, team, or legal entity) is required to register on the ARIAC website. There shall be one Official Representative for each Competition Participant. The Official Representative must provide a name, username (which may serve as a team or affiliation name), email address, and affirm that he/she has read and consents to be governed by the Competition Rules. Multiple registrations per Participant are NOT allowed. At NIST's discretion, any violation of this rule will be grounds for disqualification from the Competition. Multiple individuals and/or legal entities may collaborate as a team to submit a single entry (Participant’s code submission to a qualifier or final), in which case the designated Official Representative will be responsible for meeting all entry and evaluation requirements. Participation is subject to all U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. Participants must not be suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded from doing business with the Federal Government. Individuals entering on behalf of or representing a company, institution or other legal entity are responsible for confirming that their entry does not violate any policies of that company, institution or legal entity. Any other individuals or legal entities involved with the design, production, execution, distribution or evaluation of ARIAC are not eligible to participate.</p>
<p>Once registered, Participants will have access to the interfaces needed to participate in the competition through the ARIAC website. NIST will create an account to allow the Participants to upload their submissions to the qualifier. Modifications and improvements to a Participant's control system during the qualifying period are to be expected, but the Participant should have one final control system ready for the final competition.</p>
<h4>Eligibility for a Cash Prize</h4>
<p>To be eligible for a cash prize:</p>
<ul> <li>A Participant (whether an individual, team, or legal entity) must have registered to participate and complied with all of the requirements under section 3719 of title 15, United States Code as contained herein.</li> <li>At the time of entry, the Official Representative (individual or team lead, in the case of a group project) must be age 18 or older and a U.S. citizen or permanent resident of the United States or its territories.</li> <li>In the case of a private entity, the business shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States or its territories.</li> <li>Participants may not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment. NIST employees are not eligible to participate. Non-NIST Federal employees acting in their personal capacities should consult with their respective agency ethics officials to determine whether their participation in this Competition is permissible.</li> <li>A Participant shall not be deemed ineligible because the Participant consulted with Federal employees or used Federal facilities in preparing its submission to the ARIAC Prize Competition if the Federal employees and facilities are made available to all Participants on an equitable basis.</li> </ul>
<p>In addition, interested Participants who do not meet the eligibility requirements to win a prize (i.e., individuals who are neither a US citizen nor a permanent resident of the United States or non-US-based entities) are encouraged to participate in the Competition. They are invited to register on the ARIAC website and download the training material. The performance obtained by these Participants will be displayed on the ARIAC website in the same manner as the performance obtained by Participants who are eligible to win cash prizes.</p>

<h4>Terms and Conditions</h4>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong></p>
<p>Other than as set forth herein, NIST does not make any claim to ownership of your entry or any of your intellectual property or third-party intellectual property that it may contain. By participating in the ARIAC Prize Competition, you are not granting any rights in any patents or pending patent applications related to your entry; provided that by submitting an entry (i.e., participating in the Competition), you are granting NIST certain limited rights as set forth herein.</p>
<p>However, following the competition, Participants in the ARIAC competition will be invited, but not required, to upload their code to a NIST central repository or to otherwise make it available on a publicly accessible repository or website of their choice which will be made available on an unrestricted, irrevocable, royalty-free basis to the community as a whole, with the goal of furthering the state of the art in robot agility. The decision of whether or not to upload their code will not impact the scoring.</p>
<p>By submitting an entry, you grant to NIST the right to review and score your entry as described in the section “Basis on which finalists and winners will be selected,” to describe your entry in connection with any materials created in connection with the Competition including making public your name, scores, and the date/time that score was obtained at the Event Website, and to have the Judges, Competition administrators, and the designees of any of them, review your entry.</p>
<p>By submitting an entry in the ARIAC Prize Competition, you grant a non-exclusive, irrevocable, paid up right and license to NIST to use your name, likeness, biographical information, image, any other personal data submitted with your entry and the contents in your entry, in connection with the ARIAC Prize Competition for any purpose, including promotion and advertisement of the competition and future challenges.</p>
<p>You agree that nothing in these Rules grants you a right or license to use any names or logos of NIST or the Department of Commerce, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights of NIST or the Department of Commerce or their employees or contractors. You grant to NIST the right to include your name and your company or institution name and logo (if your entry is from a company or institution) as a Participant on the Event Website and in materials from NIST announcing Winners, Finalists, or Participants in the Competition. Other than these uses or as otherwise set forth herein, you are not granting NIST any rights to your trademarks.</p>
<p>Entries containing any matter which, in the sole discretion of NIST, is indecent, defamatory, in obvious bad taste, which demonstrates a lack of respect for public morals or conduct, which promotes discrimination in any form, which shows unlawful acts being performed, which is slanderous or libelous, or which adversely affects the reputation of NIST, will not be accepted. If NIST, in its sole discretion, finds any entry to be unacceptable, then such entry shall be deemed disqualified and will not be evaluated or considered for award. NIST shall have the right to remove any content from the Event Website in its sole discretion at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, any online comment or posting related to the Competition.</p>
<p>To advance the goals of NIST's robot agility research and other relevant technical programs, following the competition, NIST may negotiate a license for the use of intellectual property developed by a registered Participant in the ARIAC Prize Competition.</p>
<p><strong>Confidential Information</strong></p>
<p>By making a submission to the ARIAC Prize Competition, you agree that no part of your submission includes any confidential or proprietary information, ideas or products, including but not limited to information, ideas or products within the scope of the Trade Secrets Act, 18 USC §1905. Because NIST will not receive or hold any submitted materials "in confidence," it is agreed that, with respect to your entry, no confidential or fiduciary relationship or obligation of secrecy is established between NIST and you, your entry team, the company or institution you represent when submitting an entry, or any other person or entity associated with any part of your entry.</p>

In addition, you agree to waive claims against the Federal Government and its related entities, except in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue, or profits, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising from your participation in the ARIAC Prize Competition, whether the injury, death, damage, or loss arises through negligence or otherwise.</p>
<p>NIST is not responsible for any miscommunications such as technical failures related to computer, telephone, cable, and unavailable network or server connections, related technical failures, or other failures related to hardware, software or virus, or incomplete or late entries. Any compromise to the fair and proper conduct of the ARIAC Prize Competition may result in the disqualification of an entry or Participant, termination of the ARIAC Prize Competition, or other remedial action, at the sole discretion of NIST. NIST reserves the right in its sole discretion to extend or modify the dates of the ARIAC Prize Competition, to modify the test and training data provided at the Event Website, and to change the terms set forth herein governing any phases taking place after the effective date of any such change. By entering, you agree to the terms set forth herein and to all decisions of NIST and/or all of their respective agents, which are final and binding in all respects.</p>

<p><strong>Termination and Disqualification</strong></p>
<p>NIST reserves the authority to cancel, suspend, and/or modify the ARIAC Prize Competition, or any part of it, if any fraud, technical failures, or any other factor beyond NIST's reasonable control impairs the integrity or proper functioning of the ARIAC Prize Competition, as determined by NIST in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>NIST reserves the right to disqualify any Participant it believes to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the ARIAC Prize Competition or to be acting in violation of any applicable rule or condition.</p>

<p><strong>Verification of Potential Winner(s)</strong></p>
<p>All potential winners are subject to verification by NIST, whose decisions are final and binding in all matters related to the ARIAC Prize Competition.</p>
<p>Potential winner(s) must continue to comply with all terms and conditions of the ARIAC Prize Competition Rules described herein, and winning is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements.
