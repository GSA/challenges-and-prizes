I"™<h2>Electronic Application Transformation â€“  Create a model electronic application for the National School Lunch Program and help millions of American students access school meals.</h2>
<p>The cafeteria: itâ€™s the nexus of school social life â€“ a place to make friends finish up last nightâ€™s homework, refuel for recess, and play tic-tac-toe with your pizza toppings. But for many of Americaâ€™s schoolchildren, the cafeteria also serves a more essential function â€“ itâ€™s where they receive half or more of their daily nutrition.    An overwhelming majority of Americaâ€™s school childrenâ€”roughly 50 million elementary and secondary school studentsâ€”attend institutions that participate in the U.S. Department of Agricultureâ€™s (USDA) school meal programs. Most consume school meals on a regular basis. In total, about 100,000 schools and institutions serve more than five billion meals through the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and two billion via the School Breakfast Program (SBP) to Americaâ€™s children each school year.    U.S. government assistance subsidizes all program meals and allows schools to serve free and substantially reduced-priced meals to children from low-income households.    Traditionally, households have applied for free or reduced-price meal benefits by submitting paper or online applications to their schools. Millions of theseÂ applications are filed every year, and nearly 10 million low income children were approved to receive benefits in school year 2014-15 through these applications.    However, due to issues with reporting, calculating, and processing, many applications contain errors that result in incorrect eligibility decisions for children.    The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) offers a prototype paper application on its website, and thousands of school districts have adopted or modified that application for their own use. Many districts also offer online applications, but the FNS does not have an electronic prototype for them to use as a model. <em>And</em> <em>thatâ€™s where you come in!</em>    We want you to develop a forward-looking, web-based application form using personalized behavioral prompts, UX best practices, and edit-checks to assist in accurate form completion.    Applications must be skillfully and artfully designed to limit the burden on applicants and achieve two additional goals:  &lt;ol&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Facilitate access to program benefits for eligible children, and&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Strengthen program integrity by reducing application errors.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  Through this hackathon, we hope to develop a prototype that can be shared with all school districts, and that incorporates the best ideas and insights from UX designers and software developers. By participating, you have the chance to impact the user experience of millions of applicants and improve a program that helps ensure that American children have access to healthy school meals.</p>
