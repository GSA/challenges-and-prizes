I"F<p>A complete entry consists of two components, a written entry and a comic strip or video entry, described below. Entrants should review the entry form on the online platform for more details about the submission requirements and process. Entrants must register through the online platform.</p>

<p>A successful entry will be original, creative and visually appealing. No gratuitous violence or other inappropriate content will be permitted.</p>

<p><u>Written Entry </u></p>

<p>The written entry will be submitted on the challenge platform in the four sections detailed below. Each section has a 1,600-character limit including spaces (about 250 words).</p>

<p> </p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The Superhero: </strong>Name your superhero. Who are they and what is their story? Clearly and succinctly describe the main attributes of your hero and provide any necessary background information about them, including abilities, accessories and strengths and weaknesses.</li>
	<li><strong>The Accessory/Gear: </strong>Describe your superhero’s nanotechnology-enabled accessory or gear. Is it a vehicle, costume, weapon, or something else? Make sure the description focuses on the attributes of the gear: What can it do and why? How does it help the superhero?</li>
	<li><strong>The Technology:</strong> Describe how your gear incorporates nanotechnology. Give a background of the research behind your chosen technology. How does current research make your gear possible? What further advances are needed to make the gear a reality? This section does not need to be overly technical, but you should include at least two references to current nanotechnology research either in the form of news articles or scholarly journal articles (not Wikipedia), to support your explanation of the technology. The technology doesn’t have to be currently possible, but there must be research to support that it may be in the future. Extra space will be given for references.</li>
	<li><strong>The Unexpected:</strong> There are often unexpected consequences as new technologies enter into society. Describe one possible result if your nanotechnology-enabled gear was used irresponsibly (for example, like the consequences of invisibility cloaks explored in this <a href="http://www.nisenet.org/catalog/media/invisibility_cloak">video</a>). How could society help reduce the risks of this unplanned consequence?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p><u>Comic Strip Entry</u></p>

<p>The comic strip entry will be submitted on the online competition platform and should be no longer than one page. The comic strip should:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Clearly introduce the superhero and gear and tell a story. The comic strip should have a unified voice, vitality and energy, and should emphasize how the accessory is useful in overcoming the story’s conflict. It should also give insights not provided in the written entry to create a novel presentation. A successful entry will be visually striking and edited to a high standard. The comic strip should also deliver clear and understandable messages using non-technical language.</li>
	<li>Be composed either by hand or using a digital comic strip generator or drawing program.</li>
	<li>Not include any copyrighted imagery or items (resources for non-copyrighted images below).</li>
	<li>Be a JPEG file type.</li>
	<li>Provide a short caption to be displayed with the comic strip if chosen for presentation.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Video Entry</u></p>

<p>The video entry will be submitted on the online competition platform and should consist of a single video, no longer than 90-seconds.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The video should clearly introduce the superhero and gear and articulate a story. The video should have a unified voice, vitality and energy, and should emphasize how the gear is useful in overcoming the story’s conflict. It should also give insights not provided in the written entry to create a novel presentation. A successful entry will be visually striking and edited to a high standard. The video should also deliver clear and understandable messages using non-technical language.</li>
	<li>Videos do not have to include credits, but if they do, these will be included in the 90-second time limit.</li>
	<li>Entrants must upload video submissions to YouTube and provide a link to the video on the entry form.</li>
	<li>Provide a short caption to be displayed with the video if chosen for presentation.</li>
</ul>
