<p><strong>Phase 1 Scoring Criteria: Identification of successful programs</strong></p>

<p>All Criteria are scaled 1-10, with 1 being the lowest score on each dimension and 10 being the highest score on each dimension.  Scores are weighted by the proportion of each dimension and then aggregated to create a final score.  Judging criteria for Phase 1 include <strong>(Total Points 100%)</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Previously demonstrated effectiveness (statistical significance) of the program in: controlling hypertension AND/OR increasing continued monitoring of hypertension in any population, where that program could be or is already applied to women who are pregnant and/or postpartum: <strong>(40%)</strong></li>
  <li>Ability of the program to address racial/ethnic disparities and/or urban/rural disparities: <strong>(20%)</strong></li>
  <li>Use of evidence-based approaches to target gaps in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of hypertension: <strong>(20%)</strong></li>
  <li>How the program is innovative at targeting gaps in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of hypertension: <strong>(20%)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Phase 2 Scoring Criteria: Awarding plans for sustainability and replication and/or expansion</strong></p>

<p>All Criteria are scaled 1-10, with 1 being the lowest score on each dimension and 10 being the highest score on each dimension.  Scores are weighted by the proportion of each dimension and then aggregated to create a final score. Judging criteria for Phase 2 include <strong>(Total Points 100%)</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Demonstrates effectiveness (statistical significance) in: <strong>controlling hypertension</strong> in women who are pregnant and/or postpartum AND/OR <strong>increasing continued monitoring of hypertension</strong> in women who are pregnant and/or postpartum: <strong>(30%)</strong></li>
  <li>Demonstrates effectiveness (statistical significance) in addressing racial/ethnic disparities and/or urban/rural disparities in women who are pregnant and/or postpartum: <strong>(30%)</strong></li>
  <li>Demonstrates that the program has long-term viability: <strong>(20%)</strong></li>
  <li>The likely effectiveness of the plan for replication and/or expansion: (1) in another geographic area or a wider geographic area; (2) in another clinical setting; and/or (3) by increasing the size and/or reach of the program: <strong>(20%)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Phase 3 Scoring Criteria: Awarding the programs that have successfully replicated and/or expanded</strong></p>

<p>All Criteria are scaled 1-10, with 1 being the lowest score on each dimension and 10 being the highest score on each dimension.  Scores are weighted by the proportion of each dimension and then aggregated to create a final score. Judging criteria for Phase 3 include <strong>(Total Points 100%)</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Demonstrates effectiveness (statistical significance) in: controlling hypertension in women who are pregnant and/or postpartum AND/OR increasing continued monitoring of hypertension in women who are pregnant and/or postpartum: <strong>(25%)</strong></li>
  <li>Demonstrates effectiveness (statistical significance) in addressing racial/ethnic disparities and/or urban/rural disparities in women who are pregnant and/or postpartum: <strong>(25%)</strong></li>
  <li>Demonstrates that the program successfully replicated and/or expanded: (1) in another geographic area or a wider geographic area; (2) in another clinical setting; and/or (3) by increasing the size and/or reach of the program: <strong>(50%)</strong></li>
</ul>
