I"è<p>The air vehicle must autonomously launch, navigate, and recover. The air vehicle must transit at an airspeed no less than 25 knots and an altitude no greater than 1000 feet above ground level (AGL). The air vehicle must be capable of launching and recovering without a catapult, arresting net or cable, or other mechanical launch or recovery equipment. Participants shall ensure that their air vehicle is equipped with a transponder with a minimum of a Mode-3/C capability.&nbsp; Additional points will be awarded to air vehicles that integrate autonomous airborne sense &amp; avoid, landing zone assessment, and ground obstacle avoidance capabilities.</p>
<p>Participants will be required to provide the Government with lost-link/return-to-home procedures to support range safety requirements. Participants will also be required to provide the Government with technical information to support coordination for civil landing permits, frequency spectrum authorization, Commercial-of-the-Shelf (COTS) waiver approvals, and Government facility access. Participants will provide data that validates the maximum theoretical range of their air vehicle with a 45 pound payload.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the initial application to participate in this prize challenge, prospective competitors will submit a 3-5 page white paper that describes their technical approach to solving the challenge and the technical maturity of their solution. Applicants will also be required to provide a video clip of their air vehicle in flight while carrying a payload of at least 45 pounds.</p>
<p>Participation in this prize challenge will be on an invitation-only basis, based on the Government&rsquo;s review of each application submitted.&nbsp; Only U. S. citizens or permanent residents are eligible to participate. Only U.S. companies, or companies with U.S.-based offices are eligible to participate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Terms of Service:&nbsp; </strong>U.S. Government support contractors will assist in the review of data provided by applicants and competitors.&nbsp; A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) has been signed by support contractors with the U.S. Government that precludes them from disclosing any proprietary data outside of the U.S. Government. If prize challenge applicants desire a separate non-disclosure agreement with supporting contractors, applicants should submit a NDA form, along with instructions, with their prize challenge application. It is the responsibility of participants to clearly mark proprietary material.</p>
<p>The Government will be solely responsible for determining which applicants will be extended an invitation to participate in the Phase-2 Fly-Off and the selection of prize challenge winners.</p>
<p>At the Government sponsor&rsquo;s discretion, the winners of this prize challenge may receive an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) award (under 10 U.S. Code, Section 2371 or 2371b) or award of a procurement contract for experimental purposes (10 U. S. Code, Section 2373) or a combination of these authorities. In the case of an award under 10 U. S. Code, Section 2371b, a successful prototype project may result in the further award of a follow-on production agreement or contract without additional competition.&nbsp; In the case of an award under any of the authorities mentioned significant quantities may be needed for field testing.&nbsp; The Government may make an award, even if all performance goals aren&rsquo;t fully met.&nbsp;</p>
