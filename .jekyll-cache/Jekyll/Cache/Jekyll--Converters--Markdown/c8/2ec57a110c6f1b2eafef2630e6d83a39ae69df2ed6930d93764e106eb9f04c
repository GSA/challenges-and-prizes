<p><strong>Results:</strong> We are pleased to announce the winners of the Statistical Software for Healthcare Oversight Challenge.&nbsp; The grand prize winner and the two finalists were able to create new versions of RAT-STATS that were 508 compliant, replicated the four required RAT-STATS modules, and met all other competition requirements. The Grand Prize winner was selected from the three initial finalists&nbsp;by a panel of 12 users. We have also included additional acknowledgements for the teams that provided the best and the most unique graphical user interfaces (these results have also been posted on the OIG website at <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/rat-stats/prize/">https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/rat-stats/prize/</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Grand Prize Winner and Finalist:&nbsp; Doug Brown (Team Catalyst) </strong></p>
<p>Overall, Team Catalyst's entry delivered the most intuitive user experience. The entry maintained the familiarity of the original RAT-STATS design while still finding room to add several new and useful features. For example, the entry included custom confidence intervals which allowed users to calculate confidence intervals at other than the standard 80, 90, or 95 percent confidence levels. The entry went beyond the 4 modules required by the contest and included functions for stratified attribute samples and for generating sets of random numbers. As with the other finalists, the Team Catalyst entry was able to replicate RAT-STATS on 60 test cases and met the key requirements for 508 compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Finalist:&nbsp; Murray Miron </strong></p>
<p>Among a number of notable new features, Murray's entry included an integrated help system that connected relevant help information with each input element within the software. The accessibility of the information greatly reduced the need for users to refer back to a separate help screen or manual. Murray's entry also included the fastest algorithm for calculating exact confidence intervals for large attribute samples. In addition, the entry went beyond the four required modules to also include a function for determining the sample size of a design given an estimated error rate. As with the other finalists, Murray's entry was able to replicate RAT-STATS on 60 test cases and met the key requirements for 508 compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Finalist:&nbsp; Dave&nbsp;Kaniss and Tim Kaniss (Team ENGRdynamics) </strong></p>
<p>Team ENGRdyanmics' simplified the original RAT-STATS Design by combining the stratified and unrestricted variable appraisal functions into a single module. The combined module had an elegant design and was still very effective in accounting for the differences between the stratified and unrestricted analyses. The team also included a number of additional useful new features such as the ability to import files by dragging them into the target input field. &nbsp;As with the other finalists, the Team ENGRdynamics' entry was able to replicate RAT-STATS on 60 test cases and met the key requirements for 508 compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Best Graphical User Interface - Corey Berry and Aja Berry (Team CBTek)</strong></p>
<p>The graphical user interface for CBTek's entry looked great, met 508 compliance standards, and allowed for easy access to all key program functions and operations. The interface had the added advantage that it was customizable to fit the needs of the individual user. Of final note, the team's splash screen and program icon were the best of all the entries submitted.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic User Interface Honorable Mention &ndash; Sudeep Shouche and Premraj Narkhede (Team Dolcera)</strong></p>
<p>Team Dolcera provided a unique entry which split several of the RAT-STATS modules into a series of steps. The component nature of the design simplified the input and made the function requirements easier to follow for new users.</p>
<p><strong>Contest Rules and Description</strong></p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>&nbsp;Once five finalists have been identified, no further entries from teams not previously identified as finalists will be reviewed even if they are submitted prior to the May 15, 2017, 5:00 p.m. EST deadline.&nbsp; Moreover, the contest will end on May 15, 2017, at 5:00 p.m. EST even if fewer than five finalists have been selected.</p>
<p>Finalists may update their entries without losing their finalist designation. Updates from the finalists will be accepted until 5:00 p.m. EST on the fourteenth day after the fifth finalist has been identified or May 15, 2017, 5:00 p.m. EST, whichever comes first. The newest entry from each team will be used for all judging purposes unless otherwise requested by the team.</p>
<p><strong>Current Status:</strong>&nbsp;Status as of 3:00&nbsp;PM EST&nbsp;May&nbsp;31 2017:&nbsp;Three finalists.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong>&nbsp;Each year HHS handles hundreds of millions of Medicare and Medicaid claims valued at over a trillion dollars. Due to the high volume of claims, statistical sampling provides a critical tool to ensure effective oversight of these expenditures. Sampling is used by the providers in their own efforts to monitor their performance and by the various organizations within HHS. There are a wide range of different software tools for performing statistical analysis. RAT-STATS has a unique niche in that it provides a straightforward tool for individuals who need a simple but robust method for selecting and analyzing statistical samples. The RAT-STATS software was originally created in 1978 and has gone through several upgrades since that time. Unlike a full statistical package that attempts to answer all types of questions for a wide range of users, RAT-STATS serves as a streamlined solution to handle the specific task of developing valid statistical samples and estimates within the healthcare oversight setting.</p>
<p>For example, an OIG investigator may pull a simple random sample in order to estimate damages for a provider suspected of fraud. RAT-STATS generates valid pseudo-random numbers and outputs all of the information needed to replicate the sample. Once the investigator finishes reviewing the sample, he or she can then enter the results into RAT-STATS to get the final statistical estimate. While the investigator may need some basic training in statistics, he or she would not need the same level of expertise as would be required to navigate the many options available in a full service statistical or data analysis package.</p>
<p>The objective of the current challenge is to develop the foundation for an upgraded version of RAT-STATS. The current version of RAT-STATS is well validated; however, its user interface can be difficult to navigate and the underlying code makes the software costly to update. OIG needs a new, modern version of the software that is easy to use and can be extended in a cost effective manner. In addition, the new version of the software must be 508 compliant.</p>
