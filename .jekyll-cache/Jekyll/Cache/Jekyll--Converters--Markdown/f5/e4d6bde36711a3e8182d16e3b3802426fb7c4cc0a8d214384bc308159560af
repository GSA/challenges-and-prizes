I"a<p>The Space Robotics Challenge is a prize competition with a $1,000,000 total prize purse to be divided among teams that develop software to increase the autonomy of dexterous humanoid robots. Teams will use software to control a simulated R5 to resolve problems in a virtual environment.    Each team will be required to complete two qualification tasks. The qualification tasks will be run independently at each team’s site. Each team must submit two simulation log files, one for each qualification task. The log files will be evaluated by SRC officials. Instructions on how to complete the qualification tasks, and generate and submit log files will be provided to registrants upon release of the qualifying simulation software (details on challenge website). Teams may make any number of attempts at completing the qualification tasks, and submit only their best results – one file for each of two tasks. The top 20 teams will advance to the final virtual challenge.    The final virtual challenge will consist of three tasks involving the life in a (fictional) day of R5 on Mars.  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Alignment of a communication dish.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Repair a solar array.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Find and repair an air leak inside a habitat.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  Each task is composed of multiple checkpoints, described in the challenge rules.</p>
