I"¾<p>Drug overdose deaths and opioid-involved deaths continue to increase in the United States. The majority of drug overdose deaths (more than six out of ten) involve a prescription or illicit opioid. Ending this epidemic is among the Departmentâ€™s top priorities, and to combat this crisis the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has implemented a <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/index.html">five-part strategy</a> that provides the overarching framework for HHSâ€™s opioid-related activities. To build on these efforts, HHS is looking to leverage the full potential of data and technology to address the opioid crisis by hosting an Opioid Code-a-Thon. Participants will use a variety of provided datasets related to opioids and develop a solution to address one of the following challenge tracks:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Opioid Treatment&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Opioid Usage&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Opioid Misuse Prevention&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  For full details about this challenge, please view the <a href="http://hhsidealab.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/102417-competes-public-notice-remediated.pdf">official announcement of challenge requirements and registration</a>.</p>
