I"u(<p>In celebration of one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer in 1944, we are inviting you to join us for the Grace Hopper Day Hackathon. Grace was an innovative, out-of-the-box thinker and doer and her legacy reflects this. Grace invented the first compiler for a computer programming language, and was one of those who popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages which led to the development of COBOL, one of the first high-level programming languages.    We are holding a competition for all open source contributors to redesign the GSA Open website, open.gsa.gov. Open.gsa.gov is the current developer portal for all GSA data, APIs, and source code open to the public. This competition is hosted by GSA’s IT Digital Services team and will be held on Friday, December 9, 2016, to coincide with Grace Hopper’s birthday.    The goal of this redesign is to improve public engagement with GSA’s digital assets and increase understanding and awareness of agency open technology. GSA is challenging developers and designers from industry, academia and federal government to create solutions using the site product roadmap provided on the competition details webpage.    <strong>DATES: </strong>Online registration for this event will open on November 22, 2016<strong>,</strong> and will close Tuesday, December 6, 2016, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST).  The competition will take place on Friday, December 9, 2016, from 9:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST); check in will begin at 8:00 a.m. (EST).    <strong>ADDRESSES:  </strong>  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<u>Registration</u><strong>:  </strong>Registration for this event will be accomplished online at the following link: <a href="http://open.gsa.gov/grace-hopper-hackathon">http://open.gsa.gov/grace-hopper-hackathon</a>.

A government-issued ID shall be  required to gain access into the building.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  <strong>PURPOSE:</strong> In this competition, participants are asked to redesign the GSA Open website, open.gsa.gov. This website is the current developer portal for GSA data, APIs, and source code open to the public.    <strong>DETAILS OF CHALLENGE: </strong>Participants will be asked to redesign the current developer portal open.gsa.gov. The solution should be a usability-driven feature to encourage public engagement with the site and GSA digital assets. Predetermined teams (consisting of up to <strong>five</strong> individuals) are welcome to include a stand-alone or mix of private industry, academia, and eligible individuals.  Cash prizes will be awarded to the best projects.    <strong>DATA: </strong>Event information will be posted on the event page at <a href="http://open.gsa.gov/grace-hopper-hackathon/">http://open.gsa.gov/grace-hopper-hackathon/</a>.    <strong>PROJECT</strong>: Participants are asked to redesign the GSA Open website, <a href="http://www.open.gsa.gov">open.gsa.gov</a>. This website is the current developer portal for all GSA data, APIs, and source code open to the public.    <strong>ELIGIBILITY FOR CHALLENGE: </strong>Eligibility to participate in the Grace Hopper Day Hackathon and win a prize is limited to entities/individuals —  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;That have registered to participate in the competition and complied with the rules of the competition as explained in this posting; and&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;ol start="2"&gt;    &lt;li&gt;That have been incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States. In the case of an individual, whether participating singly or in a group, the participant must be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States. Participants must be at least <strong>18</strong> years of age to participate in this event.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  Participants may not be a federal entity or federal employee acting within the scope of employment.  However, an individual or entity shall not be deemed ineligible to win prize money because the individual or entity used federal facilities or consulted with federal employees during a competition if the facilities and employees are made available to all individuals and entities participating in the competition on an equitable basis.    Participants agree to assume any and all risks and waive claims against the federal government and its related entities, except in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue, or profits, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising from participation in this competition, whether the injury, death, damage, or loss arose through negligence or otherwise.  Entrants are not required to obtain liability insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility in order to participate in this competition.    As the federal government is under a strict duty not to give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual, participants must agree to take diligent care to avoid the appearance of government endorsement of competition participation and submission.  Participants must agree not to refer to the government’s use of their submission (be it product or service) in any commercial advertising or similar promotions in a manner that could reasonably imply (in the judgment of a reasonable person) that the GSA or the federal government endorses, prefers, sponsors, or has an affiliation with participants’ products or services.  Participants agree that GSA’s trademarks, logos, service marks, trade names, or the fact that GSA awarded a prize to a participant, shall not be used by the participant to imply direct GSA endorsement of participant or participant’s submission.  Both participants and GSA may list the other party’s name in a publicly available customer or other list so long as the name is not displayed in a more prominent fashion than any other third-party name.    <strong>PRIZES: </strong>GSA may award prizes of no more than $1,000 to each member of a winning team (3 teams total). GSA is not required to award all prizes if the judges determine that a smaller number of entries meet the scope and requirements laid out for this competition, or if the agency only plans to use code from a smaller number of entries.    Funding for the Grace Hopper Day Hackathon awards will come from GSA. Prizes will be awarded to each member of a winning team via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), within 60 days of announcing the winner(s).    <strong>REQUIREMENTS:  </strong>The final solution should be open source code submitted as a pull request to the GitHub repository, <a href="https://github.com/GSA/open-gsa-redesign">https://github.com/GSA/open-gsa-redesign</a>. “Open source” refers to a program in which the source code is available to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design free of charge.  In order to be Open Source Initiative Certified, the solution must meet the following nine criteria:  &lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The author or holder of the license of the source code cannot collect royalties on the distribution of the code.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The distributed software must make the source code accessible to the user.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The author must allow modifications and derivations of the work under the software’s original name.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;No person, group, or field of endeavor can be denied access to the software.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The rights attached to the software must not depend on the software being part of a particular software distribution.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The licensed software cannot place restrictions on other software that is distributed with it.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The solution must be an online, interactive solution that meets the goals and objectives provided in this document.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The solution must include documentation of all data sources used.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The solution must include a description of how the solution can be updated with additional data from other agencies, if applicable.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  The winner(s) of the competition will, in consideration of the prize(s) to be awarded, grant to GSA a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use any and all intellectual property to the winning entry for any governmental purpose, including the right to permit such use by any other agency or agencies of the federal government.  All other rights of the winning entrant will be retained by the winner of the competition.    <strong>SCOPE:  </strong>Any federal data and information that is publicly available is included in the scope of this challenge.    <strong>JUDGES:  </strong>There will be a panel of judges, each with expertise in government-wide policy, information technology, and/or acquisition.  Judges will award a score to each submission.  The winner(s) of the competition will be decided based on the highest average overall score.  Judges will only participate in judging submissions for which they do not have any conflicts of interest.    <strong>JUDGING CRITERIA:</strong> Each solution will be assessed based on technical competence and capabilities, use of design best practices to improve usability, creativity/innovation, and valuable information and insights.    <strong>CHALLENGE OBJECTIVES:</strong>  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Increase public understanding and use of GSA digital assets.
