The delivery of prizes to winners will be conditional upon participants’ ability to justify their compliance with the aforementioned conditions&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  <strong>Participation</strong>  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Participants may make submissions at any point during which the Challenge is open (June 13 - August 8)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Participants may make as many distinct submissions as they like. Duplicate submissions will be disregarded.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  <strong>Team Size</strong>  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Team size should be between one and six users on the platform.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Individuals may submit ideas on behalf of a larger, pre-existing team.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  <strong>Intellectual Property</strong>  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The text and other information or documentation submitted by participants will be openly licensed, allowing Challenge organizers to use or publish.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The solutions proposed under the Challenge remain the property of the participants. Challenge partners are not authorized to commercialize or implement these solutions without receiving prior consent from the appropriate teams.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;All the participants guarantee that they are the exclusive authors of the content (ideas, creations, images and more generally any document) of the projects and that these do not violate, directly and/or indirectly, or incorporate any element that may be the object of a property right of a third party, without any limit of territory.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  <strong>Discussion Board</strong>  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The purpose of the discussion board is to facilitate an ongoing dialogue about the Challenge and related issues. We encourage participation and discussion and expect that participants will treat each other with respect and dignity. All posts and comments on the discussion board will be reviewed. Agorize and the Challenge partners retain the right to remove or not remove posts/comments.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Comments will be removed if they:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Contain vulgar or abusive language, personal attacks of any kind, or offensive terms that target specific ethnic or racial groups&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Promote services or products (non-commercial links that are relevant to the Challenge are acceptable)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Are clearly “off topic” from the Challenge, or “spam”&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Make unsupported accusations&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Reference federal employees by name&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Violate the laws of the United States or the policies of the U.S. Department of Education&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Comments will not be edited to remove objectionable content, so please be sure that your comments contain none of the above.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;To protect your own privacy and the privacy of others, do not include personally identifiable information, such as Social Security number, addresses, phone numbers or email addresses in the body of your comment. Under no circumstances will comments be allowed to remain that contain Social Security numbers, addresses, email address, phone numbers, or similar personally identifiable information.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  <strong>Selection of Winners</strong>  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Up to 10 winners will be selected in two ways.  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Up to eight winners will be selected by a panel of judges with expertise in higher education and related fields. Judges will select winners based on relevance, ingenuity, and feasibility.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Two winners will be selected by popular vote from the public. Votes should also favor relevance, ingenuity, and feasibility.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;</p>
