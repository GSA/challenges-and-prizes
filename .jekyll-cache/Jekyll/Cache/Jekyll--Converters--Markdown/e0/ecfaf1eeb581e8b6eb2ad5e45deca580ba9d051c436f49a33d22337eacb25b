Those programs include:  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;AmeriCorps State&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;AmeriCorps National&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Tribal programs funded by AmeriCorps&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;AmeriCorps VISTA&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;AmeriCorps NCCC&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  Nominees should select only one award category and one program affiliation per submission.    <strong>Nomination Content:</strong>    Submit a narrative of up to 500 words that clearly and concisely describes the nominee’s best program design, enhancement, expansion, or experience and accomplishments as a member for the award category selected. Ideally, the narrative will include evidence of the nominee’s impact in the community or on the program or other local projects, as well as evidence to support the nominee’s work or service as innovative, a best practice and/or a highly compelling and motivating experience.    Submissions may also include photos. Photos should support the narrative submission and not replace it. Photos are encouraged as they are often very helpful in telling the complete service story. Please note that photos are not required.

Enter the award category and full name of the nominee in the Title field in the Submit Solution link.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Clearly identify the full name of the nominee, the AmeriCorps program affiliation, and the award category in the first sentence of the nomination narrative.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Provide the full name and email address of the nominator and the nominator’s affiliation with the nominee in the second sentence of the nomination. Note that nominations will not be considered complete or reviewed without the full name and contact information for the nominator.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Select <u>only one program affiliation and only one nomination category</u> for each submission. In the event a program and individual are both eligible to be nominated, submit two separate nominations: one for the new or enhanced program and one for the member, following the award category descriptions.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Describe how the nominee exemplifies excellence in AmeriCorps service or programming. Consider these questions: what made the service excellent? what data can you provide to support the impact the member or program made?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Provide details that vividly illustrate the significance of the nominated member service/program. Details should clearly show how the nominated service goes above and beyond the excellent service that is expected from all AmeriCorps members and programs each year.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Tailor the nomination narrative to the Excellence in AmeriCorps Service and Programming instructions.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Carefully proof read and review the nomination for completeness before submitting it in the Challenge Program.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;       <strong>Format for Submitting a Nomination:</strong>    Nominations must be submitted as a Solution in the Challenge Program.    <strong>Limitations:</strong>    Individuals and programs may submit no more than one nominee in each award category.
