I"ï<p>EPA is inviting the science and technology community to provide solutions using the TopCoder &amp; Innocentive platforms. The first challenge is to identify a group of in vitro assays, chemical structural descriptors, and/or chemical properties best suited for predicting the LEL. A subsequent challenge will ask for the development of algorithms that use ToxCast assay and chemical properties/descriptors to predict systemic LELs for chemicals that do not have extensive animal studies.</p>
