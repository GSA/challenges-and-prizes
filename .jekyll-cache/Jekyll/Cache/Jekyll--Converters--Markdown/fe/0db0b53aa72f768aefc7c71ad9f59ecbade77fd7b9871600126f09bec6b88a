<p><strong>Phase 1: Concept Paper</strong>
Criterion #1: Knowledge and Relevance (20%)
This criterion involves consideration of the following factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Team skill set and past experience (e.g., computer vision, video analytics, image analytics, image quality, subjective testing, NR metric development)</li>
  <li>Demonstrated focus on first responder needs in the proposed solution</li>
</ul>

<p>Criterion #2: Technical Approach (40%)
The extent to which the objective methods to assess the quality of images for computer vision applications meets the goals of the challenge:</p>
