The initial round of the Challenge will take the form of local competitions that will be run across the country beginning no earlier than August 5, 2015 and ending no later than December 2, 2015 by host organizations such as universities, accelerators, clusters, scale-up communities, SBA Resource Partners, and Microsoft stores. For more information regarding these local competitions as it becomes available, please visit <a href="https://www.sba.gov/offices/headquarters/wbo/resources/1465581">sba.gov/InnovateHER</a>. SBA will continue to update the list of local competitions as details are confirmed. While these local competitions will be identified as part of the national InnovateHER Challenge and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with these Challenge Rules, they will be administered solely by the local host organizations and will be judged by individuals selected by each host in their sole discretion. At a minimum, however, each application must contain a business plan covering the contestant’s proposed product or service and must satisfy the Challenge criteria identified by SBA in Paragraph 1 above.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  Following the completion of the local competitions, each host organization will identify one winner that will advance to the semi-final round of the Challenge. For a winning entry that has been submitted by a team of competitors, the host organization must list the team’s self-identified project leader as the winner who will advance to the semi-final round. No later than December 3, 2015, each host organization will submit a nomination package to <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">www.Challenge.gov</a> containing the winning individual/team’s business plan and other required information to SBA, which will administer the semi-final and final rounds of the Challenge. Selection as a semi-finalist following a local competition is the only means of registering for the Challenge. All nominations will be screened by SBA for eligibility. Contestants cannot submit entries directly to SBA.  &lt;ol start="4"&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong><u>Prize for Winners</u></strong>: Cash prizes totaling $70,000 will be awarded to the three highest-rated contestants in the final round of the Challenge in the following amounts:&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;1st Place - $40,000&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;2nd Place - $20,000&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;3rd Place - $10,000&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  For winning entries submitted by teams of competitors, prize money will be awarded to the self-identified project leader for distribution to the rest of the team at their discretion and independently from SBA.  &lt;ol start="5"&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong><u>Process for Host Organizations</u></strong><u>:</u>  Each host organization will determine the type of local competition, conducted in a manner that is consistent with these Challenge Rules, that will best identify the most innovative and entrepreneurial business ideas, including the type of application that individuals need to prepare in order to compete. At a minimum, however, each application must contain a business plan covering the contestant’s proposed product or service and must satisfy the Challenge criteria identified by SBA in Paragraph 1 above. The local competitions will be administered solely by the local host organizations and will be judged by individuals selected by each host in their sole discretion. <strong> However, no individual acting as a judge at any stage of this Challenge may have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of any contestant or have a familial or financial relationship with a contestant. </strong>Host organizations will also publicize the competition locally. Host organizations should notify SBA of the date and location of the local competitions for the purposes of publication at <a href="http://www.sba.gov/InnovateHER">www.sba.gov/InnovateHER</a>.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Semi-Final Round - Submission of Local Winners - <u>No later than December 3, 2015</u></strong>, host organizations must select and submit one winner from the local competition along with a Nomination Package to SBA through the <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">Challenge.gov</a> website.

In addition, in order to achieve nationwide distribution of prizes for the purpose of stimulating the growth and development of new products and services across the entire United States and across a diverse range of project types, SBA may take into account nominees’ geographic locations when selecting winners, including support to geographic regions that traditionally have limited access to capital, as well as diversity in the types of products and services. <strong>Finalists selected by SBA will be required to sign a form certifying that they meet the eligibility requirements identified in Paragraph 2 above and have complied with these Challenge Rules.</strong>&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;<strong>Final Round<em> - </em></strong>Each finalist will be offered the opportunity to participate in the InnovateHER Final Challenge to be held on March 17, 2016 in the Washington, D.C. metro area where they will make a live marketing pitch to a panel of expert judges drawn from the private sector.
