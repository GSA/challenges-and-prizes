I"n<p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> 
The <em>Challenge</em> is open to individual Submitters, teams of Submitters, universities/colleges, and commercial entities. Commercial entities must be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States (U.S.). Universities/colleges must also be in the United States (U.S.). Individual Submitters and all members of teams of Submitters must be U.S. citizens or U.S. Permanent Residents and be 18 years or older at start of the <em>Challenge</em>.

<p>The Fleet VI Challenge is looking for Submitters as identified above, that have <em>Hardware Solutions</em> that are either currently commercially available or will soon (less than 2-years) be available to the private sector and require little to no modification for the Navy’s relevant environment. A <em>Hardware Solution</em> as defined by the Navy as suitable for Fleet VI is as follows: A reliable, scalable, and user-friendly architecture that has multiple Sensors that interface together at a central video management system. This interface may be wireless, hardwired, or a combination of the two; however, it MUST maintain reliable connectivity to a central video management system for maintaining a constant state of continuous recording of VI events. Sensors, as defined by the Navy, must capture, and record high definition quality video and photos of sea interactions between vessels while maintaining a wide field-of-view and a reference point-of-view given various environmental conditions. These clear high definition videos and photos must be managed by a central video management system that may or may not have software/firmware embedded; however, this management system must be reliable, scalable, ruggedized, user-friendly, and capable of organizing captured footage. It must also contain storage capacity either internally or externally that allows sailors the capability to access stored footage at a future date.</p>
