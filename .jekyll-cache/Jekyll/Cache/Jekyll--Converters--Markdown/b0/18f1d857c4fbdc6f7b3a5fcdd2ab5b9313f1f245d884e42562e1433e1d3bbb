<p><strong>Criteria for Phase 1 - Concept Papers</strong></p>

<p>Judges will evaluate the concept papers using the criteria shown below. The specific scores will not be released publicly or provided to the Contestant. Up to 15 Contestants will be awarded prize awards of $8,500 each and receive an invitation to Phase 2: Virtual Demonstration, Evaluation of Prototypes, and Open Source Contest.</p>

<p><strong>Criterion 0: Compliance Check (pass/fail)</strong></p>

<p>This criterion will be evaluated on the following factor:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Completeness according to the â€˜How to Enterâ€™ section in the <strong>Official Rules</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If a submission passes Criterion 0, it will be evaluated on the following criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Criterion 1: Strategic Alignment &amp; Technical Outcome (70%)</strong></p>

<p>This criterion involves consideration of the following factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Strategic Alignment â€“ The extent to which the proposed approach meets the objectives listed in the challenge goals; the likelihood the contestantâ€™s solution, if successfully implemented, will have a significant real-world impact on mobile fingerprint capture capabilities.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Proposed Technology &amp; Justification â€“ Contestantâ€™s strategy for solving the problem statement, making technological improvements and justification for those improvements, aligns with the challenge goals.</li>
      <li>Method of Acquiring Fingerprint Images â€“ Contestantâ€™s demonstrated understanding of law enforcement requirements, limitations and use case.</li>
      <li>Proposed Use of Sensors, Add-on Components and Software â€“ Contestantâ€™s hardware or software plan (types of hardware/software platform) and how the plan aligns with the challenge goals.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Technical Outcome â€“ Extent to which the proposed approach will result in significant improvement in commercially available technology and will potentially result in a technical outcome that enables considerable progress toward the challenge goals.</li>
  <li>Accuracy of the technological solution â€“ demonstrates knowledge of the technical details of mobile fingerprint capture.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Criterion 2: Feasibility &amp; Team (30%)</strong></p>

<p>This criterion involves consideration of the following factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Team â€“ The extent to which the contestantâ€™s capability can address all aspects of the proposed project with a high chance of success, including, but not limited to, qualifications, relevant expertise, and time commitment of the contestant. Reviewers will assess: (a) the relevance of the qualifications and experience of the key staff, leadership, and technical experts, (b) the extent the contestantsâ€™ prior experience and the quality of the results in similar projects relate to the purpose, scope or tasks of this challenge.</li>
  <li>Approach â€“ Contestantâ€™s plan to manage the limited schedule, resources, project risks, and other challenges and produce high-quality project outcomes to meet the challenge goals.</li>
</ul>
