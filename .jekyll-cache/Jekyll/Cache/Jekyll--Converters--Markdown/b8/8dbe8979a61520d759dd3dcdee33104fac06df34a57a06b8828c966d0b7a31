I"û<p>Planning, project management, financial management, employee engagement, and reporting are among the key responsibilities of todayâ€™s public sector program managers. The approach to each of these and so many others is defined, in part, by the state of existing technology, access to data, and the ability of a skilled workforce to take full advantage of those resources.</p>
<p>Todayâ€™s tools and resources both enable and limit program managersâ€™ ability to deliver the best service to the public, efficiently and within budget, while adjusting to changes in political direction and mission focus.</p>
<p>You understand the critical importance of communication and information processing technology, the value of quality and timely data, and the cost of recruiting, training, and retaining top quality talent.</p>
<p>And you can help shape the conversation about the coming direction of public sector program management.    How will the work of public sector program managers change over the next 25 years? Â HowÂ <em>should</em>Â it change? Â HowÂ <em>can</em>Â it change with thoughtful steering?</p>
<p>The Performance Improvement Council wants to hear from you. Â Look ahead 25 years and let us know what you see.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<h4>GUIDELINES</h4>
<p>Your entry should describe where you think the field of public sector program management will be in 25 years.Â  You may choose to illustrate your vision with a scenario that reaches ahead to the year 2039.Â  Or you may describe your vision in more general terms.Â  Either way, use your foresight and be creative.</p>
<p>Note that todayâ€™s kindergartners will be well on their way to established careers in business and government in 25 years.Â  And todayâ€™s teenagers will be moving into positions of senior leadership, reshaping the way the world does business.  Although you should consider how advances in technology and the skill set of a new generation will drive the development of public sector program management, your entry need not address any particular issue or question.Â  Imagine how the work of government program managers will evolve, and describe what you see.Â  Weâ€™re interested in <i>your</i> vision.</p>
<p>The appendix at the bottom of this page contains brief profiles of four government program managers and some of the challenges they faced in 2014. Â These profiles are an entirely optional resource for your benefit. Â Use them if you find them helpful in focusing your thoughts, but do not let them limit your creativity.</p>
<p> Â <em>Your entry need not refer to any of the themes discussed in these profiles</em>.    <a href="https://challenge.platform5.challenge.gov/files/2014/02/SAMPLE-SUBMISSION-STARTERS.docx">As a starter, you may click here to get ideas for your submission. </a></p>
