<h4 id="background">Background</h4>

<p>Open data is all around us ‚Äì in the apps and websites we use, the tools that help families find housing and schools, and more.  The federal government is a critical provider of open data to the public, with hundreds of thousands of datasets maintained by government agencies and made available on platforms such as data.gov.</p>

<p>But open data on its own is not enough to deliver its full potential for Americans.  Federal open datasets need to be enabled through digital tools that put data at the fingertips of communities, businesses, families, and decision makers nationwide.  By engaging technologists and community members in creating tools with open data, government agencies can exponentially increase that data‚Äôs utility and value - and solve pressing national challenges. <strong>The Open Data for Good Grand Challenge seeks to reward the most creative and high impact uses of open data in digital tools that solve problems for the public</strong>.</p>

<p>This Grand Challenge was inspired by <a href="https://go.usa.gov/x7m4Y">The Opportunity Project </a>(TOP), a program of <a href="https://go.usa.gov/x7mjn">Census Open Innovation Labs</a> at the U.S. Census Bureau, used by federal agencies to catalyze digital tools with open data.</p>

<p>TOP sprints brings together government, communities, and technologists to create data-driven digital tools that address our nation‚Äôs greatest challenges using federal open data. Through 12-week development cycles, or ‚Äúsprints,‚Äù technologists from industry and social sectors ‚Äî including companies, nonprofits, and universities ‚Äî create digital tools to address challenges such as family economic well being, climate change, COVID-19 response and many more.  To learn more about The Opportunity Project, visit <a href="https://opportunity.census.gov">opportunity.census.gov</a>.</p>

<p>Since launching in 2016, more than 20 federal agencies and over 1,500 individuals from companies, universities and community organizations have co-created nearly 150 new digital products for the public. In 2020 alone, participants co-created more than 30 new digital products addressing challenges in the natural and built environment‚Äîsuch as reducing ocean plastic pollution, developing effective and efficient markets for recycled materials, facilitating sustainable rural economic development, and more.</p>

<p>TOP supports the Census Bureau‚Äôs mission and the OPEN Government Data Act mandate to identify and disseminate public data assets as well as utilize these public data assets to grow the economy, promote transparency, and make government data more useful and accessible to the public.  Both open data and The Opportunity Project as a mechanism to unleash its potential, are key components of the Federal Data Strategy and Department of Commerce Strategic Plan, which focus on utilizing data as an asset to grow the economy, increase the effectiveness of the Federal Government, promote transparency, and make government data more useful to the public, businesses, and researchers.</p>

<h4 id="the-problem">The Problem</h4>

<p>One of the greatest challenges associated with public interest technology (or civic technology) development is product sustainability and adoption.  Open data is used to create many products for the public good, but the teams who built these products often face challenges in deploying and maintaining them.  To advance some of the most promising technology solutions built with open data, the Census Bureau and its collaborators are launching the Open Data for Good Grand Challenge.  This Challenge aims to 1) help technologists and their collaborators better deploy their data-driven technology solutions, ensure they reach end users, and drive impact of the critical problems they aim to solve, and 2) to reward exemplary uses of federal open data. 
This challenge is open to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Anyone who participated or participates in The Opportunity Project sprints or TOPx sprints in 2020 or 2021 (between the dates of 1/1/2020 and 10/24/2021).</li>
  <li>Anyone in the general public who follows The Opportunity Project methodology via TOP‚Äôs public <a href="https://opportunity.census.gov/product-development/toolkit/">product development toolkit</a> to create a user-centered digital tool using federal open data in 2020 or 2021 (between the dates of 1/1/2020 and 10/24/2021).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Please refer to the eligibility section below for full details.</strong></p>

<p>The Census Bureau is conducting this challenge under the authority of and in accordance with the America COMPETES Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 3719.</p>
