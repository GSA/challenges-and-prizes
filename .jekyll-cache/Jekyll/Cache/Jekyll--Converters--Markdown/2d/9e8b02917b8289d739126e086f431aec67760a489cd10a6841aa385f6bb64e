I"<p>Join us for this exciting UAS (unmanned aerial systems) prize competition using your ingenuity and hardware build expertise to create a concept for a UAS prototype. The result of the <strong>UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) Flight and Payload Challenge&nbsp;</strong>will support the public safety community and its stakeholders.</p>
<p>One of the barriers for UAS used in a public safety realm is payload versus flight time. Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAS provide many different mission capabilities, but their flight time is limited. The payload capacity, energy source and flight time are linked through design trade-offs that can be optimized for efficiency and flexibility. This challenge is designed to keep the UAS and its payload airborne for the longest time possible to support first responders&rsquo; communication technology on the ground while they conduct their search. The advancement of UAS research will help search and rescue operations support payloads for wireless communications or other life-saving goods to save lives.</p>
<p>NIST Public Safety Communications Research Program is hosting this 3-stage challenge, with prize awards totaling $432,000 (includes travel, prototype &amp; cash prizes) for the top 10 designs.&nbsp; In addition to the cash prize, finalists will showcase their UAS and flight skills with paid travel to the NIST Robotics Lab and the 2018 PSCR Stakeholder conference, where pilots will demonstrate their prototype, engage in speaking opportunities and network with 500+ attendees. There are no fees or qualifications needed to enter the first stage.&nbsp; The Stage 1 winning ideas will be eligible for remaining stages of the competition. (see Official Rules)</p>

<h3>SUMMARY OF CONTESTS</h3>
<p>The following is a summary of each contest. For more information, please review the full terms and conditions for each contest as provided throughout this document.</p>
<h4>STAGE 1:&nbsp; Concept Paper Contest</h4>
<p>The Concept Paper Contest invites all eligible contestants to complete a concept paper outlining their knowledge, skills, capabilities and approach for this challenge. Contestants&rsquo; concept papers will be reviewed by a panel of subject matter experts and judges who will select those contestants to be invited to the challenge kickoff webinar. Contestants selected by the judge panel will be eligible to move forward to the Prototyping, Hardware Build and Video Test &amp; Evaluation Contest.</p>
<h4>STAGE 2:&nbsp; Prototyping, Hardware Build, and Video Test &amp; Evaluation Contest</h4>
<p>In this contest, the contestants will purchase or create the hardware necessary to implement the approach outlined within their concept paper. Contestants will purchase or create (for example, using 3D printing or machining) the hardware or parts necessary to build their prototype UAS to the specifications and required safety standards. Once the build is complete, contestants will be required to complete a series of Video Test &amp; Evaluation flights designed to ensure the contestants complete minimum requirements for safety, hardware configuration, flight time and payload with their prototype UAS. Contestants who complete this stage successfully will receive an invitation to the NIST Robotics Test Facility and up to $10,000 in invitational travel funds to attend the final Live Test &amp; Evaluation contest.</p>
<h4>STAGE 3:&nbsp; Live Test &amp; Evaluation Contest</h4>
<p>The Live Test &amp; Evaluation contest is the final contest of the series. Contestants will complete a series of live test flights to demonstrate their prototype UAS flight time and payload capabilities. All contestants UAS will be tested and evaluated. Contestants completing at least the minimum standards will be ranked and, based on those rankings, will receive up to $120,000 in award prizes. First place:&nbsp; $50,000, Second place:&nbsp; $40,000, and Third place:&nbsp; $30,000. In addition, up to $4,000 in invitational travel funding for each team of contestants or contestant entering the contest to demonstrate their work at the PSCR Annual Stakeholders Meeting in June 2018. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
