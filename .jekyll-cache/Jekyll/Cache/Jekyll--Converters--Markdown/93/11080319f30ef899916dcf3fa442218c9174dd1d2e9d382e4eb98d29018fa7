I"º<p>The Textile Test Methods Challenge seeks to develop standard test methodologies for assessing the wear performance of environmental protection garment (EPG) textiles for planetary exploration and offers three prizes of $5,000 for winning submissions. Space suits today offer multi-layered protection from harsh space environments. As we move forward with human exploration, the outer protective layerâ€™s function must expand to withstand widely varying types of dirt in planetary environments like the moon, Mars or large asteroids. This spectrum of environments beyond low earth orbit requires tools for assessing the viability of candidate space suit textiles, which donâ€™t exist today.</p>
