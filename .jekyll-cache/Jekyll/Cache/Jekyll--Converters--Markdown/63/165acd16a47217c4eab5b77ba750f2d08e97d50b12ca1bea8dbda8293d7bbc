<p><strong>Creativity - 20 percent</strong></p>
<p>The Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture state that the government should produce facilities that reflect the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the federal government, emphasizing designs that embody the finest contemporary architectural thought; that avoid an official style; and that incorporate the work of living American artists. With these Guiding Principles in mind, submissions that demonstrate greater creativity, coherence, and clarity of vision in achieving the goal of activating the plaza will be considered more favorably.&nbsp;<br /><br />*Please note that the existing artwork located in the plaza and the fa&ccedil;ade of the building, "Skygarden," by James Turrell, must be preserved.</p>
<p><strong>Context - 20 percent</strong></p>
<p>GSA recognizes that good design is responsive to context. Special attention shall be paid to the general ensemble of streets and public places of which Federal buildings form a part; and that, where possible, buildings should permit a generous development of landscape. Submissions that address and respond to the physical context of climate and the built environment will be considered more favorably.</p>
<p><strong>Community - 20 percent</strong></p>
<p>GSA strives to leverage its real estate activity to support community goals. Submissions that demonstrate a superior understanding of local issues and community goals, and which address those issues and goals in compelling ways, will be considered more favorably.</p>
<p><strong>Feasibility - 20 percent</strong></p>
<p>Designs shall adhere to sound construction practice and utilize materials, methods and equipment of proven dependability, and shall be economical to build, operate and maintain, and should be accessible. Submissions that are technically feasible to implement will be considered more favorably.</p>
<p><strong>Value - 20 percent</strong></p>
<p>Part of GSA's mission is to deliver the best value in real estate services to government and the American people. Submissions that represent a high-value intervention that can be implemented more cost-effectively will be considered more favorably.</p>
