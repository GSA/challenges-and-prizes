I"I<p>Refrigerators hold unique potential to unlock economic and social progress for the billions of un- and under-electrified people globally. Access to refrigeration can facilitate the development of income-generating micro-enterprises, prolong the shelf life of fresh foods, reduce spoilage and waste, diversify and enhance the nutritional value of diets, and reduce the time that households, particularly female household members, spend shopping for or gathering food. But the market for off-grid refrigeration products is nascent and the prevalence of refrigerators in developing countries, particularly in rural areas, remains extremely low. Highly energy-efficient, appropriately designed and priced refrigerators are essential to this marketâ€™s development and to its subsequent positive development impacts.    The off-grid household and small business refrigeration market could quickly become a major commercial opportunity. By 2020, the market could see 38% year-over- year growth and total annual spending approaching $1.1 billion. In order to be viable in off-grid settings and suitable for off-grid customers, however, refrigerators must be considerably smaller, cheaper, and run on far less energy than most conventional products. Few refrigerators available today can satisfy the needs of the off-grid market. Increasing the availability of appropriate off-grid refrigerators at affordable prices will increase demand for off-grid solar solutions such as solar home systems and mini-grids.    The Global LEAP Awards competition will recognize best-in-class off-grid refrigerators, and offer cash prizes to recognize and incentivize innovation in off-grid refrigeration technology and design. All nominated products will be evaluated for their energy performance, quality, design and reliability according to rigorous international best practice.</p>
