    rules: '<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Rules of the ARIAC Prize Competition</strong></p>  <strong>Subject
      of the Competition:</strong>    In June 2017, the National Institute of Standard
      and Technology (NIST) put on the first Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation
      Competition (ARIAC). The goal of the competition was to test the agility of
      industrial robot systems, with the goal of enabling industrial robots on the
      shop floors to be more productive, more autonomous, and to require less time
      from shop floor workers. For the second year of the competition, we are introducing
      a cash prize to motivate and expand participation.    In this context, agility
      is defined broadly to address:  <ul>    <li>Failure identification and recovery,
      where robots can detect failures in a manufacturing process and automatically
      recover from those failures</li>    <li>Automated planning, to minimize (or
      eliminate) the up-front robot programming time when a new task is introduced</li>    <li>Fixtureless
      environment, where robots can sense the environment and perform tasks on parts
      that are not in predefined locations</li>  </ul>  The competition Participants
      are required to develop a robot control system (software) to control a robot
      in a simulated environment. Gazebo (gazebosim.com), which is an open source
      robotics simulation environment, will be used as the testing platform and the
      Robot Operating Systems (ROS), which is an open source set of software libraries
      and tools, will be used to define the interfaces to the simulation system.    Software
      interfaces will be made publicly available that will allow the Participants
      to control the robot.  There will be two qualifiers in the April 2018 timeframe
      with the final competition occurring in mid-May 2018. The competition will be
      performed virtually in the cloud, so physical attendance is not required to
      compete. NIST is proposing a workshop to a major robotics conference to allow
      the winning Participants to present their approaches; details, when available,
      will be posted to the official challenge website.    <strong>Dates of the Competition:</strong>  <ul>    <li>Qualifiers
      Begin: March 5, 2018</li>    <li>Qualifiers End: April 13, 2018</li>    <li>Competition
      Testing Period Begins: May 11, 2018</li>    <li>Competition Testing Period Ends:
      5:00 PM, EDT (UTC-10:00), May 17, 2018</li>    <li>Announcement of Cash Prize
      Winners: May 18, 2018</li>  </ul>  <strong>Event Website: </strong>The Official
      Rules are posted at <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ARIAC/">https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ARIAC/</a>.
      The Event Website is <a href="http://www.nist.gov/ariac">http://www.nist.gov/ariac</a>.    <strong>Prize
      Amounts:</strong>  <ul>    <li>1<sup>st</sup> place - $10,000</li>    <li>2<sup>nd</sup> place
      - $5,000</li>    <li>3<sup>rd</sup> place - $2,500</li>  </ul>  Up to three
      winners will be selected. The Prize Purse for the ARIAC Prize Competition is
      a total of $17,500. In addition, each winner may be able to select any one representative
      from their team to present their results at a robotics conference in 2018 in
      a workshop dedicated to the ARIAC competition. NIST may be able to provide travel
      funds subject to availability.  The number of winners will be fewer than three
      if there are fewer than three Participants that qualify for the competition.
      The Prize Purse may increase, but will not decrease. Any increases in the Prize
      Purse will be posted on the Event Website. NIST reserves the right to announce
      additional winners of non-cash prizes.    <strong>Rules for being eligible to
      participate in the Competition:</strong>    Participation in the ARIAC Prize
      Competition is open to ALL; however, not all participants are eligible to win
      cash prizes as explained in the next section.    Each Competition Participant
      (individual, team, or legal entity) is required to register on the ARIAC website.
      There shall be one Official Representative for each Competition Participant.
      The Official Representative must provide a name, username (which may serve as
      a team or affiliation name), email address, and affirm that he/she has read
      and consents to be governed by the Competition Rules. Multiple registrations
      per Participant are NOT allowed. At NIST''s discretion, any violation of this
      rule will be grounds for disqualification from the Competition. Multiple individuals
      and/or legal entities may collaborate as a team to submit a single entry (Participant’s
      code submission to a qualifier or final), in which case the designated Official
      Representative will be responsible for meeting all entry and evaluation requirements.
      Participation is subject to all U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations.
      Participants must not be suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded from doing
      business with the Federal Government. Individuals entering on behalf of or representing
      a company, institution or other legal entity are responsible for confirming
      that their entry does not violate any policies of that company, institution
      or legal entity. Any other individuals or legal entities involved with the design,
      production, execution, distribution or evaluation of ARIAC are not eligible
      to participate.    Once registered, Participants will have access to the interfaces
      needed to participate in the competition through the ARIAC website. NIST will
      create an account to allow the Participants to upload their submissions to the
      qualifiers. Modifications and improvements to a Participant''s control system
      during the qualifying period are to be expected, but the Participant should
      have one final control system ready for the final competition.    <strong>Rules
      for being eligible to win a Cash Prize:</strong>    To be eligible for a cash
      prize:  <ul>    <li>A Participant (whether an individual, team, or legal entity)
      must have registered to participate and complied with all of the requirements
      under section 3719 of title 15, United States Code as contained herein.</li>    <li>At
      the time of Entry, the Official Representative (individual or team lead, in
      the case of a group project) must be age 18 or older and a U.S. citizen or permanent
      resident of the United States or its territories.</li>    <li>In the case of
      a private entity, the business shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary
      place of business in the United States or its territories.</li>    <li>Participants
      may not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their
      employment. NIST employees are not eligible to participate. Non-NIST Federal
      employees acting in their personal capacities should consult with their respective
      agency ethics officials to determine whether their participation in this Competition
      is permissible.</li>    <li>A Participant shall not be deemed ineligible because
      the Participant consulted with Federal employees or used Federal facilities
      in preparing its submission to the ARIAC Prize Competition if the Federal employees
      and facilities are made available to all Participants on an equitable basis.</li>  </ul>  In
      addition, interested Participants who do not meet the eligibility requirements
      to win a prize (i.e., individuals who are neither a US citizen nor a permanent
      resident of the United States or non-US-based entities) are encouraged to participate
      in the Competition. They are invited to register on the ARIAC website and download
      the training material. The performance obtained by these Participants will be
      displayed on the ARIAC website in the same manner as the performance obtained
      by Participants who are eligible to win cash prizes.    <strong>How to Participate
      in the Competition:</strong>  An interested Participant (individual, team, or
      legal entity) must initiate the process of participating in the Competition
      by registering at the ARIAC website. The party is then given access to view
      the documentation and download the tutorials (which provides instructions on
      how to run the simulations) from the ARIAC website. In the event NIST determines
      modifications to the documentation and tutorials are needed, all website registrants
      will be notified by email.    Once registered, the Participants are eligible
      to participate in the qualifiers. There will be two qualifiers, both occurring
      in the April 2018 timeframe (specific deadlines will be published at the official
      challenge website and all Participants notified by email). Participants only
      have to complete one of the two qualifiers to be eligible to compete in the
      final competition. A minimum score will be determined, based on the metrics
      described below, which Participants have to meet or exceed in the qualifiers
      to be eligible for the final competition.    During ARIAC Qualifiers/Finals,
      each team will submit their system so that it can be run in the automated evaluation
      setup. This is to ensure that teams are not using prohibited interfaces to interact
      with the simulation. They will have two work weeks from the date that each qualifier
      is released on the website (available to be downloaded) to submit their software
      control system that addresses the challenges in the qualifier. Registered participants
      will be emailed when the qualifier is released. The following files should be
      uploaded to an account (<a href="http://nfiles.nist.gov">nfiles.nist.gov</a>)
      that NIST will set up specifically for each Participant.    To allow the ARIAC
      Competition controllers to automatically run each team''s system, teams are
      required to submit the following files:  <ul>    <li><em>team_config.yaml</em>:
      The team''s sensor configuration file. One sensor configuration is used for
      all trials.</li>    <li><em>build_team_system.bash</em>: A bash script that,
      when invoked from the command-line on a clean Ubuntu system, will install the
      necessary dependencies and build the team''s code.</li>    <li><em>run_team_system.bash</em>:
      A bash script that, when invoked from the command-line on a system that has
      had <em>build_team_system.bash </em>run, will start the team''s system and begin
      interacting with the ARIAC competition trial.</li>  </ul>  The <em>build_team_system.bash</em> script
      will be run only once to setup the team''s system, and the <em>run_team_system.bash</em> script
      will be run one time for each of the scenarios to be tested against.    <strong>Competition
      Scenarios</strong>    The following terminology is frequently used in this document  <ul>    <li>Order:
      A list of products and their goal location in a box.</li>    <li>Product: One
      element of an order.</li>    <li>Box: A container that holds the products.</li>    <li>Fulfilled
      Order: A box and set of products that make up an order.</li>  </ul>  ARIAC requires
      Participants to complete a series of tests centered in an industrial scenario
      that is based around order fulfillment. The robot system will work within the
      environment specified in the Work Environment section.    Challenges will be
      introduced in each scenario. Scenarios may include, but are not limited to:  <ul>    <li>Baseline
      Order Fulfillment - The task for this scenario is to pick specific products
      and place them in a box. The robot arm will receive an <em>Order</em> that details
      the list of products and their target locations.</li>    <li>Dropped Product
      - One or more products will drop from the robot''s gripper. The robot will need
      to recover after dropping a product and complete the given Order. Recovery could
      entail picking up the dropped product, or fetching a new product.</li>    <li>In-Process
      Order Change<strong> - </strong>While the robot is in the middle of fulfilling
      an order, a new high priority order will be received that needs to be completed
      as fast as possible. The robot will need to decide how best to complete this
      new order, and then complete the previous order.</li>  </ul>  The competition
      will consist of 15 trials: Each trial will receive a score based on completion
      and efficiency metrics outlined in the Scoring section.    <em><u>Environment</u></em>    The
      simulation environment is a representation of an industrial order fulfillment
      work cell with a robot arm, product bins, and boxes.    There are multiple product
      bins that may be used for order fulfillment. Products in these bins will not
      be replaced once used.    There is a robot arm mounted on a linear actuator.
      The linear actuator measures <strong>4 m</strong>.    An automated guided vehicle
      (AGV) and/or drone is located at the end of the linear actuator. Orders are
      fulfilled at the AGV/drone. A Participant will programmatically signal the AGV/drone
      when the fulfilled orders are ready to be taken away. The signaled AGV/drone
      will depart with the box.    Boxes measuring <strong>0.5 x 0.7 m</strong>. are
      used for order fulfillment.    <em><u>Robot Arm</u></em>    The robot arm''s
      position is controlled through the linear actuator on which it is mounted.    The
      end of the arm is equipped with a vacuum gripper. The vacuum gripper is controlled
      in a binary manner and reports whether or not it is successfully gripping an
      object.    <em><u>Sensors</u></em>    A Participant can choose which sensors
      to use around the environment. Each sensor has a cost that factors into the
      final score.    A sample of available sensors may include:  <ol>    <li>Break
      beam: reports when a beam is broken by an object. It does not provide distance
      information.</li>    <li>Laser scanner: provides an array of distances to a
      sensed object.</li>    <li>Cognex logical camera: provides information about
      the pose and type of all models within its field of view.</li>    <li>Proximity:
      detects the range to an object.</li>  </ol>  <em><u>Order</u></em>    An order
      is an instruction containing products for the robot system to place in the box.    Each
      order will specify the products to be gathered.    <em><u>Faulty products</u></em>    Above
      the belt at a key location is a quality control sensor that detects faulty products.
      If faulty products are detected while Participants are filling boxes, those
      products should be removed from the box and replaced with another product of
      the same type. Faulty products are considered unwanted products: they will not
      count for any points when the order is fulfilled, and they will cost Participants
      the all-products bonus if left in the boxes (see Scoring, below).    <strong>Competition
      Process</strong>    Each trial will consist of the following steps:  <ol>    <li>The
      robot programmatically signals that it is able to begin accepting orders.</li>    <li>The
      first Order (Order 1) is sent to the robot.</li>    <li>A fixed amount of time
      is allowed to complete the order.</li>    <li>In the case of the Dropped Product
      testing method, up to three products will be forcibly dropped from the gripper.</li>    <li>In
      the case of the In-Process Order Change testing method, a new Order (Order 2)
      will be issued that is of higher priority than the previously issued Order 1.
      When Order 2 is complete, building of Order 1 is to resume.</li>    <li>The
      robot signals programmatically when an order is ready for delivery.</li>    <li>The
      robot system will be notified that the trial is over. The trial is over when
      time runs out or all Orders have been fulfilled.</li>  </ol>  <strong>Judging
      Panel </strong>    The NIST Director will appoint a panel of three qualified
      judges. The Judges will be robot agility and/or simulation experts from inside
      and/or outside of NIST. The Judges will determine winners according to the Judging
      Criteria described herein. The Judges may not have personal or financial interests
      in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of, any entity that is a
      registered Participant in the Competition and may not have a familial or financial
      relationship with an individual who is a registered Participant. In the event
      of such a conflict, a Judge must recuse himself or herself and a new Judge may
      be appointed.    <strong>Basis on which Finalists and Winners will be selected</strong>    A
      portion of the scores will be automatically calculated, shared with the Participants,
      and publicly posted for each Trial at the conclusion of the Finals (after all
      Trials are run) as a combination of cost and performance metrics, described
      below in the Trial Score Calculation section. A Participant''s final automated
      score is the sum of scores for each of the 15 competition Trials.    <strong>Cost
      Metrics</strong>    The following values are calculated for a Participant’s
      system setup. As Participants are to use the same system setup for all Trials,
      the values will remain unchanged between Trials.    The choices made by the
      competitors (choices of sensors) will have a specific cost associated with them.
      The costs are:  <ol>    <li style="list-style-type: none;">  <ol>    <li>$500
      for each logical camera used.</li>    <li>$200 for each depth camera used.</li>    <li>$100
      for each other sensor used (e.g., break beam, proximity, laser scanner).</li>  </ol>  </li>  </ol>  The
      sum of these cost choices made by each team will be divided by a baseline cost
      of $1700 and made into a cost factor for the scoring. The team costs are designated
      as <em>TC</em>, and the baseline cost is designated as B<em>C</em>.  The cost
      factor, is then calculated as:    <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Capture1.jpg"><img
      class="size-full wp-image-174465 aligncenter" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Capture1.jpg"
      alt="" width="156" height="58" /></a>    <strong>Completion Score</strong>    Performance
      metrics that cover both completion and efficiency are calculated for each Trial
      separately. Completion captures the quality of the orders fulfilled (that the
      boxes contain the correct products in the correct position/orientations); efficiency
      captures the responsiveness in fulfilling orders (that the orders were filled
      quickly).    Each trial, since it has the option to have more than one order,
      will have a certain set of scores for each order. Each order consists of a list
      of products needed and a prescribed position and orientation for each product
      within the shipping box. The completion score, <em>CS</em>, is a combined score
      for each order, starting with 1 point for each product that is placed in the
      shipping box. For each product that is within 3 cm of the correct position,
      and within 0.1 radians of the correct orientation will result in an additional
      point. Next, since the main focus of the competition is to have fulfilled orders,
      any order with all of the products in the confines of the shipping box and in
      the correct position/orientation receives an additional point for each product.
      So, for an order s_<em>j</em> with <em>i</em> products in it would have a maximum
      score of:    <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/capture3.png"><img
      class=" wp-image-174475 aligncenter" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/capture3.png"
      alt="" width="186" height="61" /></a>    <strong>Efficiency Factor</strong>    The
      Efficiency of the approaches chosen by the teams are accounted for in the scoring
      by using the times that each team takes to complete each trial. The times are
      counted in seconds from the start of the trial until the first order is completed
      and is designated as <em>T_01</em>. In the trials with multiple orders, the
      time, <em>Tj</em> is counted in seconds from the time that the <em>j</em>th
      order is sent to the team. For each trial, an average of the times for each
      team (<em>ATj</em>) is compared to the individual team time to calculate the
      Efficiency Factor:    <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Capture4.png"><img
      class=" wp-image-174480 aligncenter" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Capture4-300x135.png"
      alt="" width="176" height="79" /></a>    If a team’s system times out for a
      trial, the efficiency factor for the trial is set to 0 and the trial time is
      not used to calculate the average times for that trial.    For the multi-order
      trials where one of the orders is a high priority order, an additional multiplier,
      <em>h</em>, is applied with the efficiency factor to give a higher proportion
      of the score to that order, which is initially set to a value of 3. The final
      <em>h</em> value will be made available to the Participants at least two weeks
      before the finals.    <strong>Trial Score Calculation</strong>    All of the
      scoring factors described above are combined as shown below to calculate the
      score for each trial:    <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/capture5.png"><img
      class="wp-image-174485 aligncenter" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/capture5-1024x90.png"
      alt="" width="615" height="54" /></a>    <strong>Final Score Calculation</strong>    The
      final overall score is the equally weighted sum of all trial scores. As mentioned
      in the Competition Scenarios section, trials are expected to focus on the Baseline
      Order Fulfillment, Dropped Products, and In-Process Order Change scenarios,
      among others.    <strong>Winners:</strong> The Winners of cash prizes will be
      determined by three Judges appointed by the NIST Director, using the Judging
      Criteria outlined herein.    <em>Judging Criteria:</em>  <ol>    <li><strong>Overall
      Performance based on the scoring metrics described above (80 points)</strong>  <ol>    <li>Using
      the scoring metrics described herein, the first place Entry will be award 80
      points, the second place Entry will be award 70 points, the third place Entry
      will be awarded 60 points, and so on.</li>  </ol>  </li>    <li><strong>Novelty
      of approach and alignment with spirit of competition (20 points)</strong>  <ol>    <li>At
      the judges’ sole discretion, up to 20 points will be awarded for Entries that
      show novel approaches to solving the agility challenges and whose approaches
      are consistent with the spirit of the competition of coming up with industrially-implementable
      approaches that will help industry make better use of their robotic platforms.
      Each Entry is eligible for up to 20 points, and more than one Entry can receive
      all 20 points (or any other value).</li>  </ol>  </li>  </ol>  <strong> </strong>    NIST
      will announce the Finalists via the Event Website as well as those Finalists
      that have been awarded a cash award (each, an "Award"). The anticipated number
      and amount of the Awards that will be awarded for this Competition is set forth
      in these rules; however, NIST is not obligated to make all or any Awards, and
      reserves the right to award fewer than the anticipated number of Awards in the
      event an insufficient number of eligible Participants meet any one or more of
      the Judging Criteria for this Competition, based on NIST''s sole discretion.
      Using the Judging Criteria described herein, three qualified Judges (appointed
      by the NIST Director) will determine the winners of the ARIAC Prize Competition.    The
      winner verification process for being eligible to receive an Award includes
      providing the full legal name, tax identification number or social security
      number, routing number and banking account to which the prize money can be deposited
      directly. Return of any notification as "undeliverable" will result in disqualification.
      The verification form must be returned within seven (7) calendar days of receipt.
      After verification of eligibility, Awards will be distributed in the form of
      electronic funds transfer addressed to the Official Representatives specified
      in the winning Entries. That Official Representative will have sole responsibility
      for further distribution of any Award among Participants in a group Entry or
      within a company or institution that has submitted an Entry through that representative.
      The list of Entries receiving Awards for the Competition, including the names
      of all members of a team, will be made public according to the timeline outlined
      on the Event Website.    Winners are responsible for all taxes and reporting
      related to any Award received as part of the Competition.    All costs incurred
      in the preparation of Competition Entries are to be borne by Participants.    <strong>Presentation
      of Winning Approaches at a To Be Determined Workshop in a Robotics Conference:</strong>    Up
      to three Winners of the ARIAC Competition may be invited by NIST to attend a
      workshop dedicated to the ARIAC Competition at a future TBD robotics conference.
      The Winners will be required to make a 25-minute presentation on their approach
      in the ARIAC Competition followed by audience question and answer.    NIST may
      arrange and pay for the travel for one team-selected representative from each
      of the winning Participants to cover eligible travel costs such as airfare,
      conference registration fee, and lodging.    <strong>Point of Contact for the
      Competition:</strong>  Questions about the ARIAC Prize Competition can be directed

      Property Rights</strong>    Other than as set forth herein, NIST does not make
      any claim to ownership of your Entry or any of your intellectual property or
      third party intellectual property that it may contain. By participating in the
      ARIAC Prize Competition, you are not granting any rights in any patents or pending
      patent applications related to your Entry; provided that by submitting an entry
      (i.e., participating in the Competition), you are granting NIST certain limited
      rights as set forth herein.    However, following the competition, Participants
      in the ARIAC competition will be invited, but not required, to upload their
      code to a NIST central repository which will be made available on an unrestricted,
      irrevocable, royalty-free basis to the community as a whole, with the goal of
      furthering the state of the art in robot agility. The decision of whether or
      not to upload their code will not impact the scoring.    By submitting an Entry,
      you grant to NIST the right to review and score your Entry as described in the
      section “Basis on which finalists and winners will be selected,” to describe
      your Entry in connection with any materials created in connection with the Competition
      including making public your name, scores, and the date/time that score was
      obtained at the Event Website, and to have the Judges, Competition administrators,
      and the designees of any of them, review your Entry.    By submitting an Entry
      in the ARIAC Prize Competition, you grant a non-exclusive, irrevocable, paid
      up right and license to NIST to use your name, likeness, biographical information,
      image, any other personal data submitted with your Entry and the contents in
      your Entry, in connection with the ARIAC Prize Competition for any purpose,
      including promotion and advertisement of the competition and future challenges.    You
      agree that nothing in these Rules grants you a right or license to use any names
      or logos of NIST or the Department of Commerce, or any other intellectual property
      or proprietary rights of NIST or the Department of Commerce or their employees
      or contractors. You grant to NIST the right to include your name and your company
      or institution name and logo (if your Entry is from a company or institution)

      Winners, Finalists, or Participants in the Competition. Other than these uses
      or as otherwise set forth herein, you are not granting NIST any rights to your
      trademarks.    Entries containing any matter which, in the sole discretion of
      NIST, is indecent, defamatory, in obvious bad taste, which demonstrates a lack
      of respect for public morals or conduct, which promotes discrimination in any
      form, which shows unlawful acts being performed, which is slanderous or libelous,
      or which adversely affects the reputation of NIST, will not be accepted. If
      NIST, in its sole discretion, finds any Entry to be unacceptable, then such
      Entry shall be deemed disqualified and will not be evaluated or considered for
      award. NIST shall have the right to remove any content from the Event Website
      in its sole discretion at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited

description: 'The Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation Competition, ARIAC, addresses
  a critical limitation of robots used in industrial environments like factory floors:
  they are not as agile as they need to be. Many robots are not able to quickly detect
  failures, or recover from those failures. They aren''t able to sense changes in
  their environment and modify their actions accordingly. Programming these robots
  for even the simplest tasks takes time and effort. Help solve this problem by coding
  your own robot control system (software) that can outperform everyone else''s in
  a simulated environment! Compete to win $17,500 in cash prizes and the opportunity
  to showcase your solution at a future robotics conference.    Timeline for Competition:  <ul>    <li>Registration
  Open: Now through April</li>    <li>Qualifiers: March 5 - April 13, 2018</li>    <li>Finals:
