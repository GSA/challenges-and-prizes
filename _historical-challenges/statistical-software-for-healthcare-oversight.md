    rules: 'In order to take part in this Challenge participants must create a software
      package that replicates the operation of four of the functions of the original
      RAT-STATS software: (1) Single Stage of Random Numbers; (2) Unrestricted Attribute
      Appraisal; (3) Unrestricted Variable Appraisal; and (4) Stratified Variable
      Appraisal. The steps required to add additional statistical modules to the software
      must be reasonable and fully documented, and the submission must contain all
      of the required elements (refer to the Submissions page for a complete list).    In
      addition, participants must agree to the following terms and conditions.    Teams
      of one or more members can participate in this Challenge. There is no maximum
      team size.  Each team must have a captain, and each individual may only be part
      of a single team . Individual team members and team captains must register in
      accordance with the Registration Process section below.  The role of the team
      captain is to serve as the corresponding participant with OIG about the Challenge
      and to submit the team’s Challenge entry.  While OIG will notify all registered
      Challenge participants by email of any amendments to the Challenge, the team
      captain is expected to keep the team members informed about matters germane
      to the Challenge.    (1) To be eligible to win the Challenge prize, each participant
      (individual or entity) must —  a. register to participate in the Challenge under
      the rules promulgated by OIG as published in this Notice;  b. have complied
      with all the requirements under this section;  c. in the case of a private entity,
      be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States
      or, in the case of an individual, be a citizen or permanent resident of the
      United States;  d. not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within
      the scope of their employment;  e. not be an employee of OIG, a judge of the
      Challenge, or any other party involved with the design, production, execution,
      or distribution of the Challenge or the immediate family of such a party (i.e.,
      spouse, parent, step-parent, child, or stepchild); and  f. be at least 18 years
      old at the time of submission.    (2) Federal contractors may not use Federal
      funds from a contract to develop their Challenge submissions or to fund efforts
      in support of their Challenge submission.    (3) Federal grantees may not use
      Federal funds to develop COMPETES Act Challenge applications unless consistent
      with the purpose of their grant award.    (4) An individual or entity shall
      not be deemed ineligible because the individual or entity used Federal facilities
      or consulted with Federal employees during a competition if the facilities and
      employees are made available to all individuals and entities participating in
      the competition on an equitable basis.    (5) By participating in this Challenge,
      each individual (whether competing singly or in a group) and entity agrees to
      assume any and all risks and waive claims against the Federal Government and
      its related entities (as defined in the COMPETES Act), except in the case of
      willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue,
      or profits, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising from participation
      in this Challenge, whether the injury, death, damage, or loss arises through
      negligence or otherwise.    (6) No individual (whether competing singly or in
      a group) or entity participating in the Challenge is required to obtain liability
      insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility in order to participate in
      this Challenge.    (8) By participating in this Challenge, each individual (whether
      participating singly or in a group) and entity grants to OIG, in any existing
      or inchoate copyright or patent rights owned by the individual or entity, an
      irrevocable, paid-up, royalty-free, nonexclusive worldwide license to use, reproduce,
      post, link to, share, and display publicly on the Web the submission, except
      for source code. This license includes without limitation posting or linking
      to the submission, except for source code, on OIG’s public facing website (http://www.oig.hhs.gov/compliance/rat-stats/index.asp).
      In developing its future software systems, OIG may include algorithms and software
      from Challenge entries and may consult with individuals or teams that submitted
      entries.  Thus, the license also permits OIG to develop a future software system,
      independently or with others, using any algorithms or software from Challenge
      entries, including those obtained from other Challenges or solicitations, and
      OIG may freely use, reproduce, modify, and distribute the resulting future software
      system without restriction.  Each participant will retain all other intellectual
      property rights in their submissions, as applicable.    (9) OIG reserves the
      right, at its sole discretion, to (a) cancel, suspend, or modify the Challenge
      through amendment to this Federal Register notice, and/or (b) not award any
      prizes if no entries meet the stated requirements. In addition, OIG reserves
      the right to disqualify any Challenge participants or entries in instances where
      cheating or other misconduct is identified.    (10) Each individual (whether
      participating singly or in a group) or entity agrees to follow all applicable
      Federal, State, and local laws, regulations, and policies.    (11) Each individual
      (whether participating singly or in a group) and entity participating in this
      Challenge must comply with all terms and conditions of these rules, and participation
      in this Challenge constitutes each such participant’s full and unconditional
      agreement to abide by these rules. Winning is contingent upon fulfilling all
      requirements herein.    (12) Each individual (whether participating singly or
      in a group) and entity grants to OIG and its contractors assisting OIG with
      this Challenge the right to review the submission, study the algorithms and
      the code, and run the software on other sets of images.    (13) Submissions
      must not infringe upon any copyright, patent, trade secrets, or any other rights
      of any third party. Each individual (whether participating singly or in a group)
      or entity warrants that she or the team is the sole author and owner of any
      copyrightable work that the submission comprises, that the submission is wholly
      original with the participant or is an improved version of an existing work
      that the participant has sufficient rights to use and improve.  In addition,
      the submission must not trigger any reporting or royalty obligation to any third
      party.  A submission must not include proprietary, classified, confidential,
      or sensitive information.    (14) The licenses for any code used as part of
      a submission must be compatible with each other and must allow OIG to distribute
      and modify the software both within and outside the agency without incurring
      any reporting or royalty obligations to any third party.    (15) The submission
      must not contain malicious code such as viruses, timebombs, cancelbots, worms,
      trojan horses, or other potentially harmful programs or other material or information.    (16)
      The submission must be unique and must not represent a modification of a previous
      submission from another team.    (17) Submitted software must be fully functional
      and operate correctly on Microsoft Windows systems configured in accordance
      with the applicable United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB)
      and applicable configurations (https://usgcb.nist.gov/).  The group policy settings
      associated with this configuration are also available on the NIST website (https://usgcb.nist.gov/usgcb/microsoft_content.html).    (18)
      Submitted software must be a stand-alone product that is designed for end users
      to run in the standard user context without requiring elevated administrative
      privileges.    (19) Submitted software must not require or make use of any network
      capabilities.    (20) Submitted software must be section 508 compliant. For
      example, it must be possible to run all functions using a keyboard, the software
      must include a well-defined indicator of current program focus, any results
      provided in image format must also be available in text, and color coding shall
      not be used as the only means of conveying information.  For more details refer
      to section 36 CFR § 1194.21'

      of the RAT-STATS software will review the submissions from the five finalists
      and vote on which package they would prefer to serve as the RAT-STATS replacement.
      The package with the most votes will be the winner of the Grand Prize. Ties
      will be broken by the Office of Inspector General, Office of Audit Services,
      Director of Quantitative Methods. The instructions to the judges will be as
      follows, "Please review the operation of the following software packages and
      select one that you would prefer to use in the future for selecting and analyzing
      your statistical samples." Critically, the instructions do not ask which software
      is most like RAT-STATS, but rather which software they would prefer to use.
      As a result, during the review for the Grand Prize, judges will consider features
      even if they were not part of the original RAT-STATS package.

description: "<p><strong>Results:</strong> We are pleased to announce the winners
  of the Statistical Software for Healthcare Oversight Challenge.&nbsp; The grand
  prize winner and the two finalists were able to create new versions of RAT-STATS
  that were 508 compliant, replicated the four required RAT-STATS modules, and met
  all other competition requirements. The Grand Prize winner was selected from the
  three initial finalists&nbsp;by a panel of 12 users. We have also included additional
  acknowledgements for the teams that provided the best and the most unique graphical
  user interfaces (these results have also been posted on the OIG website at <a href=\"https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/rat-stats/prize/\">https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/rat-stats/prize/</a>).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Grand
  Prize Winner and Finalist: Doug Brown (Team Catalyst) </strong></p>\r\n<p>Overall,
  Team Catalyst's entry delivered the most intuitive user experience. The entry maintained
  the familiarity of the original RAT-STATS design while still finding room to add
  several new and useful features. For example, the entry included custom confidence
  intervals which allowed users to calculate confidence intervals at other than the
  standard 80, 90, or 95 percent confidence levels. The entry went beyond the 4 modules
  required by the contest and included functions for stratified attribute samples
  and for generating sets of random numbers. As with the other finalists, the Team
  Catalyst entry was able to replicate RAT-STATS on 60 test cases and met the key
  requirements for 508 compliance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Finalist: Murray Miron </strong></p>\r\n<p>Among
  a number of notable new features, Murray's entry included an integrated help system
  that connected relevant help information with each input element within the software.
  The accessibility of the information greatly reduced the need for users to refer
  back to a separate help screen or manual. Murray's entry also included the fastest
  algorithm for calculating exact confidence intervals for large attribute samples.
  In addition, the entry went beyond the four required modules to also include a function
  for determining the sample size of a design given an estimated error rate. As with
  the other finalists, Murray's entry was able to replicate RAT-STATS on 60 test cases
  and met the key requirements for 508 compliance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Finalist: Dave&nbsp;Kaniss
  and Tim Kaniss (Team ENGRdynamics) </strong></p>\r\n<p>Team ENGRdyanmics' simplified
  the original RAT-STATS Design by combining the stratified and unrestricted variable
  appraisal functions into a single module. The combined module had an elegant design
  and was still very effective in accounting for the differences between the stratified
  and unrestricted analyses. The team also included a number of additional useful
  new features such as the ability to import files by dragging them into the target
  input field. &nbsp;As with the other finalists, the Team ENGRdynamics' entry was
  able to replicate RAT-STATS on 60 test cases and met the key requirements for 508
  compliance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Best Graphical User Interface - Corey Berry and Aja
  Berry (Team CBTek)</strong></p>\r\n<p>The graphical user interface for CBTek's entry
  looked great, met 508 compliance standards, and allowed for easy access to all key
  program functions and operations. The interface had the added advantage that it
  was customizable to fit the needs of the individual user. Of final note, the team's
  splash screen and program icon were the best of all the entries submitted.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Graphic
  User Interface Honorable Mention &ndash; Sudeep Shouche and Premraj Narkhede (Team
  Dolcera)</strong></p>\r\n<p>Team Dolcera provided a unique entry which split several
  of the RAT-STATS modules into a series of steps. The component nature of the design
  simplified the input and made the function requirements easier to follow for new
  users.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Contest Rules and Description</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Important
  Note:</strong>&nbsp;Once five finalists have been identified, no further entries
  from teams not previously identified as finalists will be reviewed even if they
  are submitted prior to the May 15, 2017, 5:00 p.m. EST deadline.&nbsp; Moreover,
  the contest will end on May 15, 2017, at 5:00 p.m. EST even if fewer than five finalists
  have been selected.</p>\r\n<p>Finalists may update their entries without losing
  their finalist designation. Updates from the finalists will be accepted until 5:00
  p.m. EST on the fourteenth day after the fifth finalist has been identified or May
  15, 2017, 5:00 p.m. EST, whichever comes first. The newest entry from each team
  will be used for all judging purposes unless otherwise requested by the team.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Current

  year HHS handles hundreds of millions of Medicare and Medicaid claims valued at
  over a trillion dollars. Due to the high volume of claims, statistical sampling
  provides a critical tool to ensure effective oversight of these expenditures. Sampling
  is used by the providers in their own efforts to monitor their performance and by
  the various organizations within HHS. There are a wide range of different software
  tools for performing statistical analysis. RAT-STATS has a unique niche in that
  it provides a straightforward tool for individuals who need a simple but robust
  method for selecting and analyzing statistical samples. The RAT-STATS software was
  originally created in 1978 and has gone through several upgrades since that time.
  Unlike a full statistical package that attempts to answer all types of questions
  for a wide range of users, RAT-STATS serves as a streamlined solution to handle
  the specific task of developing valid statistical samples and estimates within the
  healthcare oversight setting.</p>\r\n<p>For example, an OIG investigator may pull
  a simple random sample in order to estimate damages for a provider suspected of
  fraud. RAT-STATS generates valid pseudo-random numbers and outputs all of the information
  needed to replicate the sample. Once the investigator finishes reviewing the sample,
  he or she can then enter the results into RAT-STATS to get the final statistical
  estimate. While the investigator may need some basic training in statistics, he
  or she would not need the same level of expertise as would be required to navigate
  the many options available in a full service statistical or data analysis package.</p>\r\n<p>The
  objective of the current challenge is to develop the foundation for an upgraded
  version of RAT-STATS. The current version of RAT-STATS is well validated; however,
  its user interface can be difficult to navigate and the underlying code makes the
  software costly to update. OIG needs a new, modern version of the software that
  is easy to use and can be extended in a cost effective manner. In addition, the
  new version of the software must be 508 compliant.</p>\r\n<p>The current version
  of the RAT-STATS software can be found at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180501000101/http://www.oig.hhs.gov/compliance/rat-stats/index.asp\">http://www.oig.hhs.gov/compliance/rat-stats/index.asp</a>.</p>"
