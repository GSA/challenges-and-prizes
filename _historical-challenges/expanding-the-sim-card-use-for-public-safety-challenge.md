      </span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Introduction:</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span
      lang=\"EN\">The Concept Paper invites all eligible contestants to submit concept
      papers; the Judging panel will evaluate their proposed approach to ensure they
      demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and the objective to securely
      store and then utilize authentication credentials on the SIM card for first
      responders. Contestants should include a materials list and/or describe how
      they will utilize the $1,000 for Phase 2 should they advance to Phase 2: Proof
      of File Stored on SIM Card. Contestants should also note that the Judging panel
      will ensure that their plan makes use of existing SIM card standards and FIDO
      authentication standard</span><span lang=\"EN\">s</span><span lang=\"EN\">.
      The Judging panel will select up to 20 contestants, invite them to participate
      in Phase 2 and award $1,000 per contestant for use in developing their prototypes
      for participation in that phase.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Important

  src=\"www.challenge.gov/assets/images/ids-images/timeline_SIMCard.png\" width=\"850\"
  height=\"239\" /></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The National Institute of Standards
  and Technology (NIST) Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division and
  its co-sponsors are requesting solvers&rsquo; assistance to explore the possibilities
  and show that the Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), commonly known as the
  SIM card, can be used as a secure storage container for public safety application
  credentials.&nbsp; Solvers are encouraged to participate in the <a href=\"http://www.publicsafetysimcard.com/\">Expanding
  the SIM Card Use for Public Safety Challenge</a> (the &ldquo;Challenge&rdquo;) for
  a total prize purse of up to $100,000.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Challenge
  Background &amp; Goals:</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Public Safety
  personnel utilize their mobile devices to access sensitive information during every
  day job requirements and emergency situations.</span> <span lang=\"EN\">For improved
  mobile communications, public safety needs a secure mechanism for storing sensitive
  information; current external secure storage solutions can be bulky and cumbersome
  to use in emergency situations.</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">They
  can also</span><span lang=\"EN\"> be expensive for public safety organizations to
  acquire and manage with </span><span lang=\"EN\">their</span><span lang=\"EN\">
  limited budgets. </span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;Current best practices recommend
  standards-based two-factor authentication, which often requires extra hardware,
  such as a token or a smart card, further inflating costs and increasing time in
  an emergency.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Since 2002, PSCR has collaborated
  with first responders, stakeholders, and innovators to ensure the development of
  reliable, intuitive, and mission-focused technologies for the public safety community.
  PSCR recognizes how cybersecurity affects every aspect of public safety communication.
  PSCR serves to develop and enhance security solutions to current and future public
  safety communications.</span> <span lang=\"EN\">This current Challenge complements
  public safety-specific Federated Identity Credential and Access Management (ICAM)
  research conducted by PSCR with other <a href=\"http://nist.gov/cyber\">NIST</a>
  laboratories, such as NIST&rsquo;s Information Technology Laboratory and their National
  Cybersecurity Center of Excellence.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This Challenge
  will convene first responders, mobile device providers, network providers, authentication
  providers, researchers, and solvers in order to collaborate and advance the state
  of mobile device security for public safety. PSCR and their co-sponsors are requesting
  solvers&rsquo; assistance to explore the possibilities for using the Universal Integrated
  Circuit Card (UICC), commonly known as the SIM card, as a secure storage container
  for application credentials.</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span>By leveraging
  solvers&rsquo; outside-of-the-box thinking to create innovative two-factor authentication
  solutions while educating public safety stakeholders on the benefit of authentication
  standards.</p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The SIM card, already used in most mobile
  devices, has characteristics that make it a robust storage device for critical mobile
  network subscriber data. The SIM card is a tamper-resistant hardware storage container
  and, if utilized as an application credential storage container, would enable applications
  to use the authentication credentials provisioned to it seamlessly. The SIM card
  offers several usability benefits for public safety, as it would be more user friendly;
  allow networks to provision credentials over-the-air via a secure channel; and potentially
  enable device sharing by keeping sensitive information on the removable SIM card.
  Additionally, as the SIM card is currently used in every mobile device, it could
  offer cost savings for public safety units as extra hardware would not be necessary.</span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">This Challenge includes three phases and requires contestants to: securely
  store a fire on a SIM card; create a mobile application that accesses a user&rsquo;s
  credentials stored on a SIM card; and authenticates to a FIDO 2 service provider.&nbsp;</span><span
  lang=\"EN\">Each contestant will be evaluated individually against the listed evaluation
  criteria, and successful contestants will be invited to move to the next phase.
  Invited contestants will be awarded cash prizes at the end of Phase 1 ($1,000) and
  Phase 2 ($2,000) to assist with developing a prototype for Phase 3. The scores from
  the final phase will be the basis for the final prize challenge awards PSCR will
  award up to $100,000 to the winners of the Challenge.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In
  addition to cash prize awards, contestants will be given the opportunity to obtain
  feedback from industry, such as the co-sponsoring entities, through planned webinars
  and other sessions, in an effort to advance both their prototypes and their connections
  in the public safety and communications technology communities. After the completion
  of this Challenge, PSCR will keep the submitted prototypes for future public safety
