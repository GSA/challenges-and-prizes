  release</a>&nbsp;announcing the final, Phase&nbsp;2 winners! Congratulations to
  them all!***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Consumer Health Data Aggregator
  Challenge is intended to spur the development of third-party, consumer-facing applications
  that use open, standardized APIs to help consumers aggregate their data in one place
  and under their control. This challenge will focus on solving the problem that many
  consumers have today &ndash; the ability to easily and electronically access their
  health data from different health care providers using a variety of different health
  IT systems.</p>\r\n<p>The lack of interoperability between electronic health record
  (EHR) systems remains a significant barrier to the modernization of health IT.&nbsp;<a
  href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fast
  Healthcare Interoperability Resources</a>&nbsp;(FHIR), developed by HL7, is a standard
  designed to increase the liquidity of granular patient data. The FHIR API allows
  data to move between vendor systems at different providers and to third-party applications
  for direct use by consumers. The latter use case is key to enabling patients to
  play a more active role in managing their health. Patients&rsquo; ability to seamlessly
  take their data with them as they move from provider to provider is one of the main
  goals of moving from a paper-based to an electronic health record system.</p>\r\n<p>Of
  course, health and wellness information is not contained solely in provider systems
  - between wearables, sensors, smartphones, and more, a great deal of patient data
  is being collected by personal and at-home devices outside of clinical settings.
  An app that&nbsp;truly captures all of a consumer's health data must be able to
  absorb and consolidate all of this data being continuously collected, much of which
  is available through APIs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>***Watch the recording of the March
  31&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1SLG1gB\">Informational Webinar</a>***&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>The
  challenge has two phases. Phase 1 requires the submission of technical and business
  plans for the application (app) while Phase 2 requires that a working app be available
  for consumers. Phase 2 of the competition will not be limited to only those who
  won Phase 1 &ndash; all Phase 1 competitors, and those who did not participate in
  Phase 1, can submit a final app at the end of Phase 2.&nbsp;The final application
  must meet the following requirements:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Uses FHIR Draft Standard
  for Technical Use 2 (DSTU2)</li>\r\n<li>Aggregates all data as specified in the
  2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/commonclinicaldataset_ml_11-4-15.pdf\">Data
  column</a>)</li>\r\n<li>Verified compatibility with different health IT developer
  systems implemented in production settings, 1 of which must be from the top 10 systems
  measured by Meaningful Use attestation per HealthIT.gov. Apps must be integrated
  with a minimum of 3 unique health IT developer systems in 2 unique provider settings.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There
  are two options to assess MU attestation here, by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Vendors-of-EHRs-to-Participating-Professionals.php\">Healthcare
  Professionals</a>&nbsp;or by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Vendors-of-EHRs-to-Participating-Hospitals.php\">Hospitals</a>.
  The top 10 system can be selected from Primary EHR Vendor &ndash; not Secondary
  EHR Vendor &ndash; in either of these reports.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Has
  been tested with patients and used in production settings</li>\r\n<li>Available
  to consumers through at least one of the following modes: mobile web, iOS Store,
  or Android Stores</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Phase 2 Participation Requirements&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>The
  second phase, to run from&nbsp;June 2 to November 7, will entail the actual development
  of the apps, verification of technical capabilities, user testing/piloting, and
  public release of the apps. This will include remote testing with providers and
  health IT developers to test the technical abilities of the apps to connect to in-production
  systems. Participants will submit:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Working app\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Provide
  the url to download/access the app.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Video demonstrating
  the app (maximum of 5 minutes)\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Provide the url of the video on YouTube
  or Vimeo.</li>\r\n<li>The video must highlight the use of FHIR to integrate with
  EHR vendor systems, including demonstration of data exchange with each system. The
  rest of the video should address the remaining evaluation criteria: functionality
  and quality of data aggregation, privacy and security of patient data, and user
  experience and visual appeal.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Slide deck describing
  app (maximum of 15 slides)\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Overall, the slide deck should complement
  the video demonstration. It should include a list of the active FHIR integrations
  with EHRs at provider settings, as demonstrated in the video. It should describe
  other functionality pertaining to the review criteria, particularly anything that
  was not covered in the video.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The grand prize
  winner will receive $50,000 and a second place winner will receive $25,000. There
  will be an additional $25,000 prize for the app that connects to the greatest number
  of unique health IT developer systems implemented in production settings (the \"Ultimate
  Connector\"), which can be won by any entry, including the grand prize or 2nd place
  winner. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Phase 1 Participation Requirements</strong></p>\r\n<p>Participants
  interested in competing for Phase 1 awards will need to submit an app development
  plan that must include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Mockup/wireframes of the app\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Provide
  a clear sense of the look, feel, and interactions of the app.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Technical
  specifications, including but not limited to planned data sources, system architecture,
  and compliance with HIPAA regulations (and other applicable law)\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Provide
  a realistic idea of what data sources, and from who, will be included; how that
  data will be integrated together and in service to the consumer&rsquo;s needs; how
  data privacy and security will be implemented.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Business/sustainability
  plan\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>How does the submitter propose to enter the market and lead
  to a successful app? The plan should include the following:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Issue
  analysis, demonstrating understanding of the issue (1 page)</li>\r\n<li>Solution
  description, describing the solution and how it addresses the issues (2 pages)</li>\r\n<li>Financial
  estimates, including revenues and expenses (2 pages)</li>\r\n<li>Engagement plan,
  including targeted customer base and stakeholders (2 pages)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Provider
  partnership\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Submitters are strongly encouraged to partner with a
  healthcare provider or EHR vendor for activities such as app development or pilot
  testing; evidence of partnership should be demonstrated with signed letters of intent
  on partner letterhead (i.e., we will not be reviewing actual business agreements).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To
  augment technical development and enhance the likelihood of a successful app that
  will continue to exist beyond the end of the challenge, a progress update/matchmaking
  event will be held that will seek to connect participants with provider partners.
  In Phase 1, up to five app proposals will be recognized as winners and awarded up
  to $15,000 each.</p>"
