description: <strong>All official entries must be submitted via the <a href="https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933764">InnoCentive
  website</a> open on the date of launch.</strong>    Improved sub-seasonal forecasts
  for weather and climate conditions (lead-times ranging from 15 to 45 days and beyond)
  would allow water managers to better prepare for shifts in hydrologic regimes such
  as the onset of drought or occurrence of wet weather extremes.    In response, Reclamation
  is launching this forecasting prize competition where solvers will submit sub-seasonal
  forecasts of temperature and precipitation for one year, competing in real-time
  against other teams as well as official forecasts from NOAA. Recognizing NOAA’s
  leadership and role in forecasting, Reclamation has partnered with NOAA on this
  competition. To be eligible for prizes, solvers with skillful performance during
  the competition will be required to submit documentation of their forecast technique.    [embed]https://youtu.be/FVSnf3OsAhk[/embed]    <em><strong>Learn
