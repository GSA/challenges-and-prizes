description: "<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>\r\n<p>The global wildlife trade
  is actively spreading a deadly disease that could cause hundreds, if not thousands,
  of the world&rsquo;s 7,000 known species of amphibians to go extinct unless we take
  immediate action to combat its spread. This disease is caused by two species of
  pathogenic chytrid fungi, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium
  salamandrivorans(Bsal), which were recently introduced to amphibian populations.
  These fungi thrive in wet cool environments, and amphibians in at least 60 countries
  have already been exposed.</p>\r\n<p>Every year, millions of amphibians are traded
  globally for use as pets, food, and research, without any required disease screening
  prior to transport. In each shipment, the number of amphibians can range from one
  to many thousands and must be quickly released to the importer. Bd and Bsal are
  invisible to the naked eye, and infections rarely cause visible symptoms prior to
  death. Therefore, genetic sampling and laboratory analysis are the most common detection
  method. Rapid, cost-effective chytrid detection methods are urgently needed to stop
  infected animals and contaminated shipping materials from entering the USA to reduce
  the threat of disease to native biodiversity.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>\r\n<p>Amphibian
  chytrid fungi are lethal to frogs and salamanders, and we must be able to detect
  its presence before we can eradicate it from infected animals. This challenge seeks
  innovative solutions to rapidly confirm and quantify the presence of chytrid fungi
  (Bd and Bsal) through non-invasive techniques in material imported into the United
  States. This includes detection on live animals, in water samples, and on surfaces
  of shipping containers (cardboard boxes, plastic bags, etc.). Detection is the first
  step towards a longer-term goal of developing treatments to safely eradicate Bd
  and Bsal from large commercial shipments of live amphibians that are imported for
  human consumption.</p>\r\n<p>There are three focus areas of this challenge:</p>\r\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp;
  LIVE ANIMALS ROADBLOCK: LIVE ANIMALS CANNOT BE HARMED OR HELD FOR LONG PERIODS OF
  TIME.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Amphibians are purchased as exotic pets, for human consumption
  (as frogs legs), and biomedical research subjects, and therefore, cannot be damaged
  in the detection process. These animals must be released to importers as quickly
  as possible following their arrival in order to protect their health (in a matter
  of a couple hours, or less, following importation). Currently, the time required
  to submit DNA samples to a laboratory and obtain results can be days, if not weeks.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;
  WATER SAMPLES ROADBLOCK: LARGE WATER SAMPLES ARE CURRENTLY NEEDED TO DETECT LOW
  CONCENTRATIONS OF BD/BSAL</strong></p>\r\n<p>Similar to the current Bd/Bsal detection
  methods on a live animal, a water filter sample must be collected and submitted
  to a laboratory for molecular analysis where the presence of pathogen DNA can be
  confirmed via<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction\">&nbsp;PCR</a>.
  Each sample can cost approximately $20-$40 to have processed, and low pathogen concentrations
  may dip below current genetic detection limits to accurately and confidently identify
  the presence of Bd/Bsal in water. We invite solutions to test and detect Bd/Bsal
  in water using low-cost techniques with a fast turn-around time between sample and
  result.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp; SUBSTRATES AND SURFACES OF SHIPPING MATERIALS
  ROADBLOCK: SUBSTRATES LIKE SHIPPING MATERIALS, SOIL, AND BAGS CAN HOST BD/BSAL ZOOSPHORES
  UNDETECTABLE BY SIGHT</strong></p>\r\n<p>We invite solutions to test and detect
  Bd/Bsal on shipping materials (cardboard boxes, plastic bags, etc.) using low-cost
  techniques with a fast turn-around time between sample and result.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Criteria</strong></p>\r\n<p>This
  challenge seeks innovative approaches that provide fast results after sample collection,
  the ability to test many samples per shipment, and a low price per sample.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>SPEED:</strong>&nbsp;The
  time from sample collection to Bd/Bsal detection confirmation should be under 15
  minutes.</li>\r\n<li><strong>COST:</strong>&nbsp;Cost per sample should aim to be
  less US$1. The overall cost for detecting the presence of Bd/Bsal in a shipment
  must be less than US$50.</li>\r\n<li><strong>POWER:</strong>&nbsp;Detection must
  be performed onsite without access to electricity.</li>\r\n<li><strong>ACCURACY:</strong>&nbsp;The
  test must exceed the Bd qPCR sensitivity and specificity of 72.9% and 94.2%, respectively,
  as per Skerratt et al. (2011) and be able to detect the presence of 1 or more Bd/Bsal
  zoospore equivalents.</li>\r\n<li><strong>NON-INVASIVE TO ANY ANIMAL:</strong>&nbsp;A
  tissue sample must not be required from any animal, whether live or dead, but skin
  swabs and water samples are allowed (one current invasive method of chytrid detection
  is by microscopic examination to observe the presence of infection in a tissue sample).</li>\r\n<li><strong>QUANTIFICATION:</strong>&nbsp;The
  test must be able to quantify the burden of infection present (pathogen load).</li>\r\n<li><strong>IDENTIFICATION:&nbsp;</strong>Results
  must provide the information needed to identify the lineage of pathogen present.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The
  ability to quantify the pathogen load is also desired, though not a required capability
  of a successful solution.</p>"
