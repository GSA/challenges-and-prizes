    rules: "<div>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Official Rules of Phase 3: Demonstration
      of Haptic Interface Prototypes in Virtual Reality Contest</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\r\n<p>PSCR
      will provide the invited contestants with 3 fully functional Unreal Engine virtual
      environments with their corresponding scenario details (i.e., law enforcement,
      EMS, and fire service). (A link to the environments has been made publicly available
      on the <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/communications-technology-laboratory/pscr/funding-opportunities/prizes-challenges/2019-haptic\">PSCR
      website</a>.) Each of the environments requires a desired performance task of
      which the haptic interface prototypes will be tested and evaluated to determine
      their impact on the task. Contestants will submit a video of their prototype(s)
      highlighting the functionality and a write-up with instructions on use of the
      prototype for pass/fail evaluation. The subject matter experts and Judging panel
      will evaluate the prototypes and award contestants with passing entries an invitation
      to demonstrate their prototypes at the 2019 Stakeholder Meeting. A minimum of
      2 prototypes are required for submission and demonstration at the meeting, however,
      contestants will be receiving feedback from first responders in attendance and
      would benefit from showcasing as many solutions as possible.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Haptic
      Providers</strong></p>\r\n<p>If at least 1 of the Haptic Development Teams supported
      by a Haptic Provider is awarded an invitation to demonstrate at the 2019 Stakeholder
      Meeting, the Haptic Provider will also be awarded an invitation to attend the
      2019 Stakeholder Meeting. Up to 3 Haptic Providers may be invited to the 2019
      Stakeholder Meeting. At the 2019 Stakeholder Meeting, Haptic Providers will
      have the opportunity to demonstrate their products. Also, they will provide
      support to their matched Haptic Development Teams during the demonstration of
      their prototypes. No official prize challenge judges will evaluate the prototypes.
      Invited Haptic Providers will be awarded travel funding to attend the 2019 Stakeholder
      Meeting, up to $5,000 for two team members. All contestants invited to demonstrate
      at the 2019 Stakeholder Meeting will also be deemed eligible to move forward
      to the next contest, Evaluation Round 1: Haptic Interface Prototypes in Virtual
      Reality.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Haptic Development Teams </strong></p>\r\n<p>Each
      Haptic Development Team&rsquo;s haptic interface prototype(s) must meet UI/UX
      and functional elements based on the desired objectives in the 3 scenarios,
      for example, situational awareness for law enforcement, navigation for fire,
      and vital monitoring for EMS. Based on the compliance testing and functional
      evaluation, up to 9 Haptic Development Teams will be awarded an invitation to
      demonstrate at the 2019 Stakeholder Meeting.</p>\r\n<p>At the 2019 Stakeholder
      Meeting, invited Haptic Development Teams will have their prototypes available
      for demonstration and feedback from the attending public safety community; there
      will be no official judging during the stakeholder meeting. Invited Haptic Development
      Teams will be awarded travel funding to attend the 2019 Stakeholder Meeting,
      up to $5,000 for two team members. All contestants invited to demonstrate and
      that attend the 2019 Stakeholder Meeting will also be deemed eligible to move
      forward to the next contest, Evaluation Round 1: Haptic Interface Prototypes
      in Virtual Reality.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Important Dates </strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Start

  height=\"242\" /></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The National Institute of Standards
  and Technology (NIST) Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division is hosting
  the <a href=\"https://publicsafetyhaptics.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Haptic
  Interfaces for Public Safety Challenge</a>. Up to $425,000 will be awarded to winning
  teams that create haptic interface prototypes that could improve public safety operations.</span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">Public safety officials perform tasks in a variety of environments that
  severely limit their senses and ability to communicate. </span><span lang=\"EN\">This
  </span><span lang=\"EN\">challenge seeks to investigate the relevance of haptic
  interfaces assisting in first responder tasks</span><span lang=\"EN\">, such as
  monitoring patient vitals, navigating complex spaces with limited visibility, or
  maintaining situational awareness. </span><span lang=\"EN\">The challenge consists
  of multiple phases and will require contestants to develop three haptic interface
  prototypes to be integrated into PSCR-provided virtual reality scenarios as well
  as a final haptic prototype embedded into firefighter PPE for use in a search and
  rescue task.</span><span lang=\"EN\"> Contestants will also have the opportunity
  to demo their initial prototypes with first responders at <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/2019-public-safety-broadband-stakeholder-meeting\">the
  2019 Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder Meeting</a> in Chicago, IL.PSCR will assess
  the efficiency, effectiveness, and level of user satisfaction of the haptic interface
  prototypes and their ability to assist first responders in conducting their tasks.
  </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The challenge launches March 18, 2019, and concept
  paper submissions are now due May 3, 2019, at 5 p.m. ET.</span></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong><span
  lang=\"EN\">Challenge Background &amp; Goals</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">One
  goal of the challenge is to assess the potential of using virtual reality as a development
  tool to prototype and iterate on designs for public safety technology. Contestants
  will have the opportunity to enhance their prototypes after interacting with public
  safety stakeholders and receiving feedback on their designs. </span><span lang=\"EN\">This
  challenge also seeks to convene members of the haptic provider community and innovators
  in the development community to advance the state of haptic interfaces for public
  safety. </span><span lang=\"EN\">PSCR will keep the prototypes for future public
  safety demonstrations. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Since 2002, <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr\">PSCR</a>
  has collaborated with first responders, stakeholders, and innovators to ensure the
  development of reliable, intuitive, and mission-focused technologies for the public
  safety community.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In 2018, PSCR launched their
  first challenge in the User Interface / User Experience (UI/UX) series focused on
  advancing interfaces that allow a public safety user to effectively interact with
  and obtain information from the technology system(s) while ensuring the device is
  designed around public safety&rsquo;s operational needs. In 2018, PSCR named 6 winners
  in the Virtual Reality Heads-Up Display Navigation Challenge. </span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">The contestants, consisting of <strong>Haptic Providers</strong> and
  <strong>Haptic Development Teams</strong>, and their haptic interface prototypes
  will be evaluated in two key areas: </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">1) How the
  prototypes impact a first responder&rsquo;s performance in three virtual reality
  (VR) scenarios [law enforcement, emergency medical services (EMS), and fire service]
  and </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">2) How, once embedded into firefighter personal
  protective equipment (PPE), the prototypes assist firefighters in a realistic scenario
  as they navigate and conduct a search and rescue task at a firefighter training
  facility.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The challenge consists of multiple
  phases and will require contestants to develop three haptic interface prototypes
  to be integrated into PSCR-provided virtual reality scenarios as well as a final
  haptic prototype embedded into firefighter PPE for use in a search and rescue task.
  After the completion of this challenge, PSCR will keep the submitted prototypes
  from Phase 4 and Phase 5 for future public safety demonstrations. Contestants are
  encouraged to develop multiple sets of prototypes throughout the challenge, in anticipation
  of this PSCR keeping the prototypes for demonstrations, and in case the contestants
  experience technical difficulties during later phases of the challenge.</span></p>\r\n<p
