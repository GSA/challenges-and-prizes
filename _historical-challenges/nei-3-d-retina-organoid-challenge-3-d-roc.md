### Description
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg .challenge-section}

<p>The National Eye Institute (NEI), part of the National Institutes of Health, is seeking ideas for how to develop advances in vitro 3-D human retina organoid models. The goal of the challenge is to turn innovative ideas into concrete concepts for the development of a 3-D system that models the cellular organization and function of the human retina. Full description and details of this prize competition are defined on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/about/goals-and-accomplishments/nei-research-initiatives/3-d-retina-organoid-challenge-3-d-roc/2017-ideation-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEI&rsquo;s challenge details</a>&nbsp;page. NEI is seeking innovative solutions to achieve significant advances over currently available protocols to grow retina organoids. As solvers address the evaluation criteria outlined below, they should state how and why they expect their proposed new methods or changes/additions to existing methods will improve aspects of retina organoids. Solutions must outline ideas to produce 3-D retina organoids that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are generated from human cells (derived from iPSC, federally approved ESC, multipotent cells, or adult cells subjected to a combination of transdifferentiation/reprogramming methods);</li>
<li>Are physiologically and morphologically relevant to normal or disease state; and</li>
<li>Consist of the major retina cell types and represent their biological functions and interplay.</li>
</ul>
<p>Solutions that propose to grow cells in 2-D culture using a tissue-on-a-chip system are not of interest for this Challenge. However, creative approaches that incorporate use of microfluidics or perfusion to enhance culture of 3-D organoids are encouraged.</p>

### Prizes
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg .challenge-section}

<h2>Ideation winner and honorable mention</h2>
<p>The National Eye Institute awarded $90,000 in prize money to a team led by Erin Lavik, Sc.D., at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, for its concept to create a living model of the human retina. Lavik&rsquo;s team participated in the&nbsp;3-D Retina Organoid Challenge (3-D ROC) &ldquo;ideation&rdquo; phase, which asked participants for&nbsp;ideas&nbsp;to generate human retinas from stem cells.&nbsp;Concepts were evaluated based on their innovativeness and feasibility.&nbsp;A review panel assessed how each proposal addressed scientific challenges such as how to assemble distinct and anatomically correct layers of retinal tissue, assess retinal cell function, and use the prototypes to understand diseases or test therapies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A follow-on &ldquo;reduction to practice,&rdquo; or implementation, challenge will ask participants to submit publication-quality data showing they can build functional human retina&nbsp;tissue.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Winning team</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Erin Lavik</strong>, ScD, University of Maryland, Baltimore&nbsp;County</li>
<li><strong>Steven Bernstein</strong>, MD, PhD, University of Maryland Medical&nbsp;School</li>
<li><strong>Adam Day</strong>, University of Maryland, Baltimore&nbsp;County</li>
<li><strong>Bryan Ibarra</strong>, University of&nbsp;Miami</li>
</ul>
<p>The team&rsquo;s idea is to build a retina by screen printing adult neural progenitor-derived retinal neurons in layers that mimic the structure of the human retina.&nbsp;The system is scalable and efficient which should enable the high reproducibility and increased throughput necessary for drug&nbsp;testing.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Honorable mention teams</h2>
<p>Five teams were also recognized with&nbsp;honorable mention.</p>
<h3>Carrier team</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rebecca Carrier, PhD, Northeastern&nbsp;University</li>
<li>Michael Young, PhD, Schepens Eye Research&nbsp;Institute</li>
<li>Joyce Y Wong, PhD, Boston&nbsp;University</li>
<li>Joydip Kundu, PhD, Northeastern&nbsp;University</li>
<li>Petr Baranov, MD, PhD,&nbsp;Schepens Eye Research&nbsp;Institute</li>
<li>Mike Ferguson, Boston&nbsp;University</li>
</ul>
<p>Their organoid-microvessel co-culture system proposes to add vasculature embedded in a biomimetic hydrogel to organoids to increase oxygen and nutrient flow and mimic chemical and physical cues present in developing eye tissue. The system also includes retinal pigmented epithelium and can be used to model and study age-related macular degeneration&nbsp;(AMD).&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Gamm team</h3>
<ul>
<li>David Gamm, MD, PhD, University of&nbsp;Wisconsin</li>
<li>William Murphy, PhD, University of&nbsp;Wisconsin</li>
<li>Nader Sheibani, PhD, University of&nbsp;Wisconsin</li>
<li>Chris Sorenson, PhD University of&nbsp;Wisconsin</li>
<li>Bikash Pattnaik, PhD, University of&nbsp;Wisconsin&nbsp;</li>
<li>Melissa Skala, PhD University of&nbsp;Wisconsin</li>
</ul>
<p>In the eye, the outer neural retina is fed via diffusion while the inner neural retina requires a separate microvasculature that is absent in organoids. This results in disparity in outer vs. inner neural retina survival and function in vitro. The team proposes to incorporate a perfusable inner retinal microvasculature using microfluidic technology and to model retinal microvascular diseases such as diabetic&nbsp;retinopathy.</p>
<h3>Liu team</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wei Liu, PhD, Albert Einstein College of&nbsp;Medicine</li>
<li>Rui Chen, PhD, Baylor College of&nbsp;Medicine</li>
<li>Z. Jimmy Zhou, PhD, Yale School of&nbsp;Medicine</li>
<li>Albert Lowe, Albert Einstein College of&nbsp;Medicine</li>
</ul>
<p>The protocol efficiently generates retina organoids by altering key time-consuming variable steps. They propose to engineer additional retinal tissues on scaffolds and use the system to study Leber Congenital Amaurosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Pelaez team</h3>
<ul>
<li>Daniel Pelaez, PhD, University of&nbsp;Miami</li>
<li>J. William Harbour, MD, University of&nbsp;Miami</li>
<li>Zenith Acosta, University of&nbsp;Miami</li>
</ul>
<p>The team&rsquo;s novel tissue bioreactor system compartmentalizes and creates gradients of stimuli such that the maturation of inner and outer retinal cells are induced separately. The system recapitulates the normal physiology in which the retina is exposed to a steep gradient of oxygen tensions across the highly oxygenated outer retina, and the hypoxic inner retina and can be used to model&nbsp;Retinoblastoma.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Schenke-Layland team</h3>
<ul>
<li>Katja Schenke-Layland, PhD, Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and&nbsp;Biotechnology</li>
<li>Stefan Liebau, PhD,&nbsp;Eberhard Karls University&nbsp;T&uuml;bingen</li>
<li>Peter Loskill, PhD,&nbsp;Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and&nbsp;Biotechnology</li>
</ul>
<p>The culture system proposed allows for 3-D co-culture of retinal organoids, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and further cell types in a defined and reproducible microenvironment, featuring a physiological vasculature-like perfusion for multiple weeks. Their 3-D Retina-on-a-chip system features 48 individual units in an integrated chip with standard well plate-dimensions that will be amenable for high content drug&nbsp;screening.</p>

winner-solution-description-0: "Recapitulating the architectural and cellular
  organization of the retina has been challenging, but biology hints at the possibility
  with the formation of eye cups and organoids. However, these structures are
  not amenable to high throughput screening approaches which are critical to developing
  new understanding and therapies, nor do they develop normal structures such
  as the optic nerve.\r\n\r\nApproaches for making complex tissue models include
  photolithography, 3D printing, and bioprinting. These allow one to develop patterns
  and architectures that are seen in vivo, but they require materials and processes
  are not always compatible with retinal cells and progenitors due shearing forces
  associated with many of the 3D printing technologies and UV light for the photopolymerizable
  approaches.\r\n\r\nWe have developed an alternative approach based on screen
  printing tissue models that avoids UV light and the shearing issue. It is simple,
  reproducible, and highly scalable, making it suitable for high throughput assays.
  We have shown that we can print both a range of gels and cells in complex patterns
  with high resolution and reproducibility. This allows us to recapitulate the
  layers of the retina and to provide the matrix cues to promote the critical
  polarization of the cells types and promote the formation of appropriate synapses
  in the system, and enhanced survival of target neurons.\r\n\r\nBy coupling this
  approach with human RPE cells and human adult neural stem cells derived from
  the eye and optic nerve which have been shown to express markers for the major
  retinal cell types, we can make a system that models the 3D retina and optic
  nerve structures in a scalable and reproducible manner that is exceptionally
  well suited to high throughput screening approaches for understanding and treating
  diseases of the retina."
