  - winner-solution-description-0: "Recapitulating the architectural and cellular
      organization of the retina has been challenging, but biology hints at the possibility
      with the formation of eye cups and organoids. However, these structures are
      not amenable to high throughput screening approaches which are critical to developing
      new understanding and therapies, nor do they develop normal structures such
      as the optic nerve.\r\n\r\nApproaches for making complex tissue models include
      photolithography, 3D printing, and bioprinting. These allow one to develop patterns
      and architectures that are seen in vivo, but they require materials and processes
      are not always compatible with retinal cells and progenitors due shearing forces
      associated with many of the 3D printing technologies and UV light for the photopolymerizable
      approaches.\r\n\r\nWe have developed an alternative approach based on screen
      printing tissue models that avoids UV light and the shearing issue. It is simple,
      reproducible, and highly scalable, making it suitable for high throughput assays.
      We have shown that we can print both a range of gels and cells in complex patterns
      with high resolution and reproducibility. This allows us to recapitulate the
      layers of the retina and to provide the matrix cues to promote the critical
      polarization of the cells types and promote the formation of appropriate synapses
      in the system, and enhanced survival of target neurons.\r\n\r\nBy coupling this
      approach with human RPE cells and human adult neural stem cells derived from
      the eye and optic nerve which have been shown to express markers for the major
      retinal cell types, we can make a system that models the 3D retina and optic
      nerve structures in a scalable and reproducible manner that is exceptionally
      well suited to high throughput screening approaches for understanding and treating
      diseases of the retina."

description: 'The National Eye Institute (NEI), part of the National Institutes of
  Health, is seeking ideas for how to develop advances in vitro 3-D human retina organoid
  models. The goal of the challenge is to turn innovative ideas into concrete concepts
  for the development of a 3-D system that models the cellular organization and function
  of the human retina. Full description and details of this prize competition are
  defined on <a href="https://nei.nih.gov/content/3-d-roc-challenge-details" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer">NEI’s challenge details</a> page.    NEI is seeking innovative
  solutions to achieve significant advances over currently available protocols to
  grow retina organoids. As solvers address the evaluation criteria outlined below,
  they should state how and why they expect their proposed new methods or changes/additions
  to existing methods will improve aspects of retina organoids. Solutions must outline
  ideas to produce 3-D retina organoids that:  <ul>    <li>Are generated from human
  cells (derived from iPSC, federally approved ESC, multipotent cells, or adult cells
  subjected to a combination of transdifferentiation/reprogramming methods);</li>    <li>Are
  physiologically and morphologically relevant to normal or disease state; and</li>    <li>Consist
  of the major retina cell types and represent their biological functions and interplay.</li>  </ul>  Solutions
  that propose to grow cells in 2-D culture using a tissue-on-a-chip system are not
  of interest for this Challenge. However, creative approaches that incorporate use
  of microfluidics or perfusion to enhance culture of 3-D organoids are encouraged.'
