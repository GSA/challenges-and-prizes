  the Step Up App Challenge</h3>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JL69rrgciMs\"
  width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p><strong>***</strong>Miss&nbsp;the
  Step Up App Challenge:&nbsp;Phase 1 Informational Webinar? <strong><a href=\"https://www.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/stepup_Challenge/step-up-challenge-phase-1-webinar-slides.pdf\">Check
  out the slides presented during the August 23 webinar</a>***</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>The
  Background</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are vital to understanding
  the complex needs of a patient. For this challenge, PRO data are defined as &ldquo;any
  report of the status of a patient&rsquo;s health condition that comes directly from
  the patient, without interpretation of the patient&rsquo;s response by a clinician
  or other medical expert.&rdquo; In other words, PRO data come from patient self-assessments
  and look beyond the clinical data to assess how a patient feels about his or her
  health.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>The Problem</strong></h4>\r\n<p>While PRO data have proven
  useful to healthcare providers, they are not widely used in clinical settings. Recently,
  some digital tools have been developed to streamline the collection of PRO data.
  However, those digital tools are not widely adopted due to challenges related to
  clinician workflow and patient ease with the tools. &nbsp;Also, researchers who
  want to analyze PRO data across different practices or health systems often encounter
  the issue that data are not collected in a standardized manner. Creating a digital
  tool to efficiently collect, aggregate, and share PRO data is critical to advancing
  the quality of care.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Phase 1 Winners</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The
  Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Step Up App Challenge is seeking
  innovative technologists to develop user-friendly apps that collect standardized
  PRO data for clinical and research purposes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Phase 1 winners announced:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p

  solution focuses on patient engagement, ease of use for physicians, and EHR integration
  in order to encourage the digital collection of PRO data. The patient centered app
  offers both mobile and web applications, enabling patients to receive reminders
  and track their own progress while providers can receive patient health notifications
  and easily review data to prepare treatment plans based on patient priorities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p
  style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Asymmetrik:</strong> Asymmetrik&rsquo;s Phoenix
  Integration Platform<sup>TM</sup> allows healthcare providers to use FHIR<sup>&reg;</sup>
  to leverage existing investments in data infrastructure, simplify data analytics
  to make informed decisions across health systems, and deploy secure, data-driven
  applications for researchers, doctors, and patients. Built on the award-winning
  Phoenix Server<sup>TM</sup>, Asymmetrik&rsquo;s patient engagement solution can
  help healthcare providers improve patient engagement and care coordination by exchanging
  PRO data with patients, targeting patients with low response rates or certain medical
  conditions, and analyzing responses in real time.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:

  designed to allow patients to interact directly with their providers including inputs
  from wearables, and has an easy-to-understand interface viewable to both the patient
  and provider that tracks progress. Using a combination of artificial intelligence
  (AI), machine intelligence (MI), and natural language processing (NLP), DEXi Care
  Map can provide tailored information to patients and providers and is able to parse
  user input and feedback into structured data.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Health
  Wizz:</strong>&nbsp; The Health Wizz<sup>TM</sup> solution incentivizes patients
  to provide sought after data through \"Campaigns\" (e.g., Chronic Disease Management
  Campaign, Patient Reported Outcome Campaign, etc.). Participants can choose to accept
  Campaign invitations and can receive rewards for participation. The data can be
  entered and tracked on the patient's mobile device or wearable and can be transferred
  into an EHR system accessible to clinicians.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>1upHealth:</strong>
  ProUp<sup>TM</sup> is a secure, patient facing application developed by 1upHealth
  that facilitates seamless integration between EHR systems and PRO data collected
  via easy to complete PRO questionnaires.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Qidza
  Inc:</strong> Qidza's ProNoggin<sup>TM</sup> mobile app is designed to improve the
  collection of PRO data by addressing health literacy gaps via simple designs, increasing
  patient engagement via personalization, and improving data aggregation and sharing
  via FHIR integration.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>cliexa:</strong>

  Shared Decision Making (SDM) process between patients and providers in a user-friendly
  application that strives to improve patient knowledge and satisfaction through producing
  benchmarked PRO scores for patients and risk/benefit evaluation when discussing
  surgery. Patients easily enter PRO data regarding non-specific low back pain and
  are presented with comprehendible recommendations including personalized estimates
  of normative outcomes based on patients&rsquo; age, sex and other features.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p
  style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>PRISM:</strong> PRISM<sup>TM</sup> is an application
  developed by a multi-disciplinary team that enhances the quality of clinical discussion
  between healthcare providers and patients by providing the option for patients to
  fill out PRO questions before or during office visits via a mobile application or
  web site. Patients can compare their health trends to the overall population while
  providers and healthcare organizations have access to the PRO data from within the
  EHR.&nbsp; Providers have the ability to send individual reminders to patients and
  they can use dashboards to track population trends and patient response rates.</p>\r\n<p
  style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Social &amp; Scientific Systems PatientPort:</strong>
  PatientPort<sup>TM</sup> is a secure, patient-centric application leveraging a user-friendly
