description: Million Hearts<sup>®</sup> is a national initiative to prevent one million
  heart attacks and strokes by 2017. Achieving this goal means 10 million more Americans
  must have their blood pressure under control. Million Hearts<sup>®</sup> is working
  to control high blood pressure through clinical approaches, such as using health
  information technology to its fullest potential and integrating team-based approaches
  to health care, and community approaches, such as strengthening tobacco control
  and lowering sodium consumption. For more information about the initiative, visit
  <a href="http://www.millionhearts.hhs.gov/">www.millionhearts.hhs.gov</a>.    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    To
  support improved blood pressure control, HHS/CDC is announcing the 2015 Million
  Hearts<sup>®</sup> Hypertension Control Challenge. The challenge will improve understanding
  of successful implementation strategies at the health system level by motivating
  clinical practices and health systems to strengthen their hypertension control efforts.
  It will identify clinicians, clinical practices, and health systems that have exceptional
  rates of hypertension control and recognize them as Million Hearts<sup>®</sup> Hypertension
  Control Champions. To support improved quality of care delivered to patients with
  hypertension, Million Hearts<sup>®</sup> will document the systems, processes, and
  staffing that contribute to the exceptional blood pressure control rates achieved
  by Champions.    &nbsp;    Champions will receive local and national recognition.
