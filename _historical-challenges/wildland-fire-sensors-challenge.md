  Summary:</strong>    Federal, state, local, and tribal agencies are interested in
  new ways to monitor air quality during fire events to better protect public health.
  Air quality managers and public health officials have limited access to accurate
  information on ground-level air pollution levels in the vicinity of wildland fires,
  making it difficult to prov<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wp-content/2017/03/WFSC-graphic-hashtag.png"><img
  class="size-medium wp-image-161142 alignleft" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wp-content/2017/03/WFSC-graphic-hashtag-297x300.png"
  alt="" width="297" height="300" /></a>ide appropriate strategies to minimize smoke
  exposure. Most air pollution monitoring equipment is large, not easily transportable,
  and complex to operate. Today, emerging technologies – including miniaturized direct-reading
  sensors, compact/powerful microprocessors, and wireless data communications – offer
  the opportunity to develop new systems to quickly gather and communicate air pollution
  data.    Wild fires are increasingly common events that produce significant air
  pollution, posing health risks to first responders, residents in nearby areas, and
  downwind communities. Also, wild fires are increasing in frequency and intensity,
  and the fire season is growing longer.  Prescribed fires<strong>, </strong>which
  are used to manage ecosystems or reduce risk of wild fires, are typically managed
  to minimize downwind impacts on populated areas; however, people in close proximity
  may still be exposed to smoke.  The description “wildland fires” refers to both
  wild and prescribed fires.    This challenge seeks a field-ready prototype system
  capable of measuring constituents of smoke, including particulates, carbon monoxide,
  ozone, and carbon dioxide, over the wide range of levels expected during wildland
  fires. The prototype system should be accurate, light-weight, easy to operate, and
  capable of wireless data transmission, so that first responders and nearby communities
  have access to timely information about local air quality conditions during wildland
  fire events.    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wp-content/2017/04/WFSClogosround2.png"><img

  period has closed. For reference purposes only:</strong>    Step 1: A written preview
  of the proposed solution addressing specific <strong>Solution Requirements</strong>
  presented in the Challenge. The written preview, expected to be about 3 pages, should
  include a brief description of the measurement principle for the four target pollutants,
  size (weight and dimensions), power requirements, maintenance procedures, data communications,
  and cost estimate for a production scale, turn-key sensor network kit composed of
  six sensor nodes and one central data receiving unit. You should also include a
  photograph of the prototype sensor system (not part of the 3 pages above). This
  preview will be reviewed to ensure the proposed system can be accepted for laboratory
  evaluation.    Step 2: If the proposed solution is accepted for testing, the Solver
  will provide:  <ol>    <li>A prototype sensor system capable of rapid deployment
  and continuous monitoring of air pollution during a fire event. The system should
  include a central data receiving unit and at least two nodes that collect air quality
  and location data that is transmitted back to the central receiving unit on a 5-minute
  frequency. The central data receiving unit may be cloud-based if FedRAMP compliant
  (fedramp.gov).</li>    <li>Supporting documentation, including the following: 1)
  Operation manual with sufficient detail for an end user to independently operate
  and maintain the sensor system, 2) Description of any potential safety hazards were
  the system to be exposed to fire, and 3) Cost estimate for a production scale, turn-key
  sensor network kit composed of six sensor nodes and one central data receiving unit</li>  </ol>  <strong>Awards</strong>    The
  Challenge award is contingent upon qualitative evaluation and experimental validation
  of the submitted Solutions by the Seeker. The maximum award for meeting all the
  requirements is <strong>$60,000</strong>. If more than one meets all the requirements,
  the Seeker will decide on a winner that best fits their needs. In the event that
  no solution meets all the requirements, the Seeker may, at their discretion, give
  partial awards to those submissions deemed promising from a minimum of <strong>$10,000
  up to $50,000</strong>.    In addition to the potential award, all Solvers providing
  prototypes will directly receive information on their system’s laboratory test results
  as well as qualitative feedback by air monitoring experts. If the system proves
  to be reliable and useful, deployment of a larger-scale sensor network is anticipated
  as part of follow-up projects measuring smoke impacts during wild and prescribed
  fires.    <strong>Solution Requirements: </strong>Specific requirements for the
  sensor systems, such as pollutant detection limits and precision and accuracy targets,
  are provided in the challenge description (see <a href="https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933927">https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933927</a>).    <strong>Eligibility:</strong>
  Any sensor developer or researcher is invited to participate in the Wildland Fire
  Sensors Challenge. International submissions are welcome. There are some restrictions
  for federal employees and others with work already funded by a federal agency (See
  eligibility criteria at <a href="https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933927">https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933927</a>).    To
  receive an award, the Solvers will <u>not</u> have to transfer their exclusive IP
  rights to the Seeker. Instead, Solvers will grant to the Seeker a <em>non-exclusive
  license</em> to practice their solutions. See <a href="https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933927">https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933927</a>
  for details.    Written submissions to this Challenge must be received by 11:59
  PM (US Eastern Time) on <strong><u>November 22, 2017</u></strong>. <strong>Late
  written submissions will <u>not</u> be considered</strong>. Once the written submissions
  are received, the Seeker will request prototypes and provide directions for shipping
  after the above deadline. Prototypes along with supporting documentation must be
  received by the Seeker by <u>January 5, 2018,</u> for testing.    <strong>Informational
