  - prize-description-0: The Challenge Phase II prizes will be ISO ETV 14034 verification
      reports and statements posted on the VerifiGlobal website. EPA has committed
      funds to support up to three verification reports and statements. The value
      of each verification report is approximately $47,268 in testing and verification
      services. If a sensor technology developer independently approached VerifiGlobal
      and Battelle and asked for ISO ETV 14034 verification of their sensor, the cost
      would be close to $100,000 for one sensor without the benefits of the Challenge
      Phase II Prototype Testing Program.

description: "<p><strong>Check out the <a href=\"http://www.verifiglobal.com/en\">VerifiGlobal</a>
  website (and scroll down) to register for the July 16th, 2018 informational webinar!</strong></p>\r\n<p>Conventional
  on-site wastewater treatment systems, or OWTS, (also referred to as septic systems)
  are not designed to remove nitrogen to the extent required for avoiding harmful
  algal blooms and for protecting and restoring many productive and valuable marine
  and coastal waters. Successfully removing nitrogen to address these concerns may
  require use of more advanced technology in OWTS. Regulatory officials recognize
  the benefit and value of solutions that remove high nitrogen levels but need more
  confidence in the long-term performance of I/A OWTS technologies before approving
  their use. Effective long term management of I/A nitrogen removal OWTS requires
  data that provides a real- time indication of proper functioning over the lifetime
  of the treatment system. <strong>A sensor which can measure the nitrogen concentration
  in I/A OWTS effluent coupled with real time reporting would give regulators, managers,
  communities and homeowners improved ability to assure systems are working properly,
  optimize their performance, and maintain these technologies over their lifetime,
  as well as provide the information needed to assess the effectiveness of restoration
  actions on receiving waters.</strong> Cost effective verification of system performance
  through use of a nitrogen sensor will protect public health and the environment,
  provide data to confirm and revise estimates of watershed-wide nutrient loadings,
  allow for more accurate models of nitrogen impact on receiving waters, and offer
  evidence of reasonable return on investment for homeowners and communities.</p>\r\n<p>The
  ideal sensor would provide accurate measurement of total nitrogen in I/A OWTS effluent,
  effluent flowrate, include telemetry, be self-calibrating or require infrequent
  calibration, last 10 years, require no more than 1 maintenance visit per year and
  cost the homeowner less than $1,000. Such an ideal technology may not be possible.
  At a minimum, a sensor would provide accurate measurement of nitrate (NO<sup>-3</sup>)
  and ammonium (NH<sup>+4</sup>), effluent flowrate, be easily accessed and maintained
  (no more than four maintenance visits per year), require infrequent calibration,
  last 5 years and cost less than $1,500. Because Total Nitrogen is composed of organic
  and inorganic fractions, measuring NO<sup>-3 </sup>and NH<sup>+4</sup> may significantly
  underestimate Total Nitrogen. To address this, the near-ideal sensor would measure
  NO<sup>-3 </sup>and NH<sup>+4</sup>, as well as Total Organic Carbon (TOC). The
  TOC value would be used to estimate Organic Nitrogen using an empirically-derived
  value of the nitrogen content of the TOC.</p>\r\n<p>Phase I of the Challenge requested
  submissions of sensor designs having the capabilities discussed above, and awards
  were given at the June 29, 2017 Sensor Showcase Day.</p>\r\n<p>Phase II, the Prototype
  Testing Program, will be managed by EPA. EPA will first seek submissions of functioning
  prototypes for testing and evaluation. EPA selected Battelle Memorial Institute
  (Battelle) to support the development of a Test/Quality Assurance Plan and Verification
  Protocol (T/QAP) and oversee the testing of the sensor prototypes.&nbsp;Phase II
  testing will be completed at the Massachusetts Alternative Septic System Test Center
  (<a href=\"http://www.barnstablecountyhealth.org/programs-and-services/massachusetts-alternative-septic-system-test-center,\">MASSTC</a>),
  a National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) certified test facility in Barnstable, Massachusetts,
  in 2018. Pursuant to the Agency&rsquo;s authority under sections 104(a) and (b)
  of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1254(a) and (b), EPA has entered into a Memorandum
  of Understanding with MASSTC to memorialize this cooperative relationship. Battelle
  will collaborate with <a href=\"http://www.verifiglobal.com/en\">VerifiGlobal</a>
  on the verification to ensure compliance with ISO ETV 14034.</p>\r\n<p>Battelle
  has convened a Technical Panel to provide the technical input and expertise necessary
  to develop an effective verification protocol and T/QAP based on the ISO ETV Standard
  14034.&nbsp; The Technical Panel includes experts from EPA, US Geological Survey
  (USGS), the Alliance for Coastal Technologies, the University of Maryland, the New
  England Onsite Wastewater Training Program at the University of Rhode Island (URI),
  the MASSTC, onsite regulators from MA and Suffolk County NY, the National Onsite
  Wastewater Recycling Association (NOWRA &ndash; onsite wastewater manufacturers
  are members of this association), the New York State Center for Clean Water Technology
  at Stony Brook University, and other university engineering programs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The
  Challenge</strong></p>\r\n<p>EPA selected Battelle Memorial Institute (Battelle)
  to support the Prototype Testing Program by developing a Test/Quality Assurance
  Plan (T/QAP) and Verification Plan and overseeing the testing of the sensors. The
  T/QAP is based on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iso.org/home.html\" target=\"_blank\"
  rel=\"noopener\">International Organization for Standardization&nbsp;</a>Environmental
  Technology Verification (ETV) Standard - ISO 14034. Funding for the testing program
  is from the US EPA Office of Research and Development and the Office of Water/Wastewater
  Management.</p>\r\n<p>Sensor testing will be conducted at the Massachusetts Alternative
  Septic System Test Center (<a href=\"http://www.masstc.org/\" target=\"_blank\"
  rel=\"noopener\">MASSTC</a>), a National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) certified test
  facility in Barnstable, Massachusetts in 2018-19. Under the new schedule, sensor
  developers will have the opportunity to test their sensor twice during the one-month
  tests, which will be held in October 2018 and January 2019. Each one-month test
  will include the one-week screening test during the first 7 days.</p>\r\n<p>Developers
  whose sensors are judged to be capable of meeting minimum performance goals based
  on their one-week screening results will be invited to participate in an extensive
  6-month field performance test. Battelle will verify the results of the field performance
  tests based on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.verifiglobal.com/en\" target=\"_blank\"
  rel=\"noopener\">VerifiGlobal&nbsp;</a>Performance Verification Protocol and the
  requirements of the ISO 14034 ETV standard.</p>\r\n<p><strong>New Phase II Testing
