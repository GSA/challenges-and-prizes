  us for a live webinar showcasing the winning entries on 11/30 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT.
  Register here to join:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://west.exch027.serverdata.net/owa/redir.aspx?C=wqHJEHbtebVXHixuVO9NyKSlNGni7AF6YUPnEMYabWlE06WqPhnUCA..&amp;URL=https%3a%2f%2fattendee.gotowebinar.com%2fregister%2f350576362580662274\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/350576362580662274</a>.***</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>The
  Move Health Data Forward Challenge encourages participants to create an application
  programming interface (API) solution that uses the implementation specifications
  created by the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://openid.net/wg/heart/\">HEART Workgroup</a>&nbsp;(Heart
  WG) to allow people to securely authorize the movement of their health data to destinations
  they choose.</p>\r\n<p>The HEART WG was developed to advance the process of gathering
  representatives from many different health-related technical communities worldwide
  (private-sector, government and non-governmental organizations) working in areas
  such as patient authentication, authorization, and consent &ndash; to collaborate
  on developing open-source specifications.</p>\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://openid.net/wg/heart/\">HEART
  WG</a>&nbsp;has created a set of privacy and security specifications (HEART implementation
  specifications) using the following open standards:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://oauth.net/2/\">OAUTH
  2.0</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://openid.net/developers/specs/\">OpenID Connect</a>and&nbsp;<a
  href=\"https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/draft-uma-core.html\">User Managed
  Access</a>&nbsp;(UMA). These specifications empower people to control the authorization
  of access to health-related data sharing APIs.</p>\r\n<p>Participants are expected
  to engage people to test the implementation of the Solution and make possible processes
  that need consumers to authorize the release of their health data to a destination
  they choose. Participants must recruit individuals and obtain their authorizations
  to test the implementation of the Solution using their health data. The data for
  the API and Solution should be provided by Phase 2 finalists.</p>\r\n<p>The Challenge
  will have three phases and two finalists each winning $75,000. Phase 1 will award
  $5,000 for up 10 finalists each based on the proposals they submit to the Challenge.
  Phase 1 winners will move to Phase 2, which will award $20,000 for up to 5 finalists
  each based on the prototype of their Solution. Phase 2 winners will move to Phase
  3, which will award $50,000 for up to two winners each based on the participant&rsquo;s
  ability to implement their Solution.</p>\r\n<p>This multi-phased approach allows
  participants to assemble, implement and test their Solutions. The final phase of
  the Challenge will require finalists to show a consumer-facing Solution that incorporates
  the HEART implementation specifications and uses an API that empowers consumers
  to control the movement of their health data.</p>\r\n<p>This Challenge encourages
  participants to apply independently or team with others including health IT developers,
  health care providers and other entities with the appropriate expertise related
  to this Solution. Lessons learned and the Challenge&rsquo;s results will be shared
  in order to support other organizations implementing solutions that make possible
  consumer-mediated exchange.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Questions about the Move Health Data
  Forward Challenge can be posted to the Discussion section and will be regularly
  monitored.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>CHALLENGE PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Phase
  1 &ndash; Proposals&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Proposal Phase allows participants
  to present Solutions that increase consumers&rsquo; access to and sharing of their
  information within electronic health record systems. In this phase, participants
  should describe the technical, operational, financial and business aspects of their
  proposed Solution. The main goal of Phase 1 is for participants to show feasible
