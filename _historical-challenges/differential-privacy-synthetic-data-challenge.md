    rules: "<h3>Match Contest Rules</h3>\r\n<h4><em>(The NIST Official Rules are explained
      below the Match Contest Rules.)</em></h4>\r\n<p>These rules pertain to the competition
      hosted on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/Differential-Privacy-Synthetic-Data-Challenge\">Topcoder
      website</a>.</p>\r\n<p>In the event of any discrepancy or inconsistency between
      the terms and conditions of the official rules located at Challenge.gov and
      these Guidelines or any other Competition materials, the terms and conditions
      of the NIST Official Rules on Challenge.gov as specified within the Challenge
      Specific Agreement shall control.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">1.
      This Challenge will tentatively run from October 31 2018 to May 6 2019 and be
      divided into a sequence of three matches.&nbsp; Each match will introduce new
      constraints to the scoring function, described later.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:
      30px;\">2. Upon registration for the challenge, the participants will receive
      one (1) or more datasets bifurcated into training and testing data in addition
      to instructions or pseudo code to generate the ground truth for the training
      set for all matches to date.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">3. For
      match 1 the ground truth will be generated using only Clustering Analysis.</p>\r\n<p
      style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">4. For match 2 the ground truth will be generated
      using Clustering and Classification.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">5.
      For match 3 the ground truth will be generated using Clustering, Classification
      and Regression Analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">6.
      Inside the JSON submission payload, participants will receive a value of delta
      from NIST/Topcoder and will submit their synthetic datasets at three different
      values of epsilon: 0.1, 1, 10.&nbsp; A test harness (shell script and or Jar
      file) will be provided to sequentially run the participant solutions with different
      epsilon values that will concatenate and format the output for submission to
      Topcoder.&nbsp; Participants with algorithms that produce high quality privatized
      synthetic data on smaller values of epsilon, will receive higher scores.</p>\r\n<p
      style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">7. Upon proper submission, participants will be
      redirected to the leaderboard where they will see their handle and the new score.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p
      style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">8. Certification Process: All participants will
      be required to submit a complete written explanation of their algorithm, and
      a clear, correct mathematical proof that their solution satisfies differential
      privacy, to a dedicated mailbox.&nbsp; This document will be reviewed by NIST
      staff or their delegates (who may request clarification or rewriting if documents
      are unclear or underspecified).&nbsp; Participants will receive &ldquo;certification&rdquo;
      that they have a basic understanding of differential privacy, or a brief explanation
      why their algorithm or proof are incorrect.&nbsp; An indicator will display
      on the leaderboard to all participants who have had their approach certified.</p>\r\n<p
      style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">- For participants with higher than normal scores
      for their specified epsilon and delta, the participant algorithm and code must
      be provided as often as requested by NIST staff or their delegates who will
      review for non-intentional mistakes. This is a courtesy to ensure the participant
      still qualifies for prize eligibility.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">-
      Certification status will be used in determining the provisional score for entries.</p>\r\n<p
      style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">- Only certified approaches are eligible for cash
      prizes (see rule #9, Final Review).</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">9.
      Final Review: Before awarding cash prizes to participants who place in prize-winning
      ranks at the end of each Marathon Match, these participants must submit a report
      containing their complete algorithm description and mathematical privacy proof,
      along with their source code.&nbsp; They will have 7 days notification to provide
      this report.&nbsp; This report will be subject to a final review to verify that
      their algorithm correctly satisfies differential privacy at the stated values
      of delta and epsilon, and that the code correctly implements the stated algorithm.&nbsp;
      The review will be performed by Topcoder and NIST staff or their delegates,
      which may include NIST certified subject matter experts from outside NIST.&nbsp;
      If a participant is placed in a prize winning rank but fails to provide the
      report, or the review determines that their solution does not satisfy differential
      privacy, then they will not receive a prize, and it will be awarded to the participant
      with the next best performance who successfully completes the final review.</p>\r\n<p
      style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">10. An indicator will be present on the leaderboard
      to identify submissions with intention to publicly share their solutions at
      the end of the final match.&nbsp;Having this indicator will not increase or
      decrease participants&rsquo; chances of winning a prize.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:
      30px;\">11. Relinquish - Topcoder/NIST is allowing registered participants or
      teams to &ldquo;relinquish&rdquo;.&nbsp; Government employees, students or any
      persons who are not allowed to take monetary prizes or feel they may have a
      conflict of interest are welcome to participate in the challenge while agreeing
      to forego the monetary prizes (by responding to the Relinquish post in the challenge
      forum).&nbsp; Relinquish means the member will compete, and their solutions
      scored, but they will not be eligible for a prize. Once a person or team relinquishes,
      we post their name to a forum thread labeled &ldquo;Relinquished Competitors&rdquo;.&nbsp;Members
      who relinquish must submit their implementation code and methods to maintain
      leaderboard status. Winners who are identified as relinquished will still be
      publicly recognized in the final winner announcements based on their placement
      on the leaderboard and the prize award, normally allotted to the placement of
      the relinquished team, will be given to the next certified team on the leaderboard.
      Throughout the challenge, the challenge&rsquo;s online leaderboard will display
      rankings and accomplishments, giving them various opportunities to have their
      work viewed and appreciated by stakeholders from industry, government and academic
      communities.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">12. All participants must
      register on the challenge platform, hosted by Topcoder as members.&nbsp; If
      they are already members, they must be in good standing (not banned or suspended).</p>\r\n<p
      style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">13. Teaming is allowed, participants are permitted
      to form teams for this competition. After forming a team, participants of the
      same team are permitted to collaborate with each other. To form a team, a Topcoder
      member may recruit other Topcoder members, and register the team by completing
      the Topcoder Teaming Form for this challenge. Each team must declare a Captain.
      All participants in a team must individually register for this Competition and
      accept Topcoder's Terms and Conditions prior to joining the team. Team Captains
      must apportion prize distribution percentages for each teammate on the Teaming
      Form. The sum of all prize portions must equal 100%. The minimum permitted size
      of a team is 1 member, the maximum permitted team size is 5 members. Only team
      Captains may submit a solution to the Competition. Topcoder members participating
      in a team will not receive a rating for this Competition. Notwithstanding Topcoder
      rules and conditions to the contrary, solutions submitted by any Topcoder member
      who is a member of a team but is not the Captain of the team may be deleted
      and is ineligible for award. The deadline for forming teams is 11:59pm ET on
      the 21st day following the date that Registration and Submission opens as shown
      on the Challenge Details page for each match. Topcoder will prepare a Teaming
      Agreement for each team that has completed the Topcoder Teaming Form and distribute
      it to each member of the team. Teaming Agreements must be electronically signed
      by each team member to be considered valid. All Teaming Agreements are void,
      unless electronically signed by all team members by 11:59pm ET of the 28th day
      following the date that Registration &amp; Submission opens as shown on the
      Challenge Details page. Any Teaming Agreement received after this period is
      void. Teaming Agreements may not be changed in any way after signature.&nbsp;
      The registered teams will be listed in the contest forum thread titled &ldquo;Registered
      Teams&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">14. Organizations such
      as companies may compete as one competitor if they are registered as a team
      and follow all challenge and platform rules.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:
      30px;\">15. In this match participants may use any programming language and
      libraries, including commercial solutions, provided Topcoder/NIST are able to
      run it free of any charge. You may use open source languages and libraries provided
      they are equally free for your use, use by another competitor, or use by NIST.
      If your solution requires licenses, you must have these licenses and be able
      to legally install them in a testing VM (see &ldquo;Ways to Win: Final Prizes&rdquo;
      section). Submissions will be deleted/destroyed after they are confirmed. Topcoder/NIST
      will not purchase licenses to run your code. Prior to submission, please make
      absolutely sure your submission can be run free of cost, and with all necessary
      licenses pre-installed in your solution. Topcoder/NIST are not required to contact
      submitters for additional instructions if the code does not run. If we are unable
      to run your solution due to license problems, including any requirement to download
      a license, your submission might be rejected. Be sure to contact us right away
      if you have concerns about this requirement.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:
      30px;\">16. If the solution includes licensed software (e.g. commercial software,
      open source software, etc), participants must include the full license agreements
      with the submission. Include licenses in a folder labeled &ldquo;Licenses&rdquo;.
      Within the same folder, include a text file labeled &ldquo;README&rdquo; that
      explains the purpose of each licensed software package as it is used in your
      solution.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">17. External datasets and
      pre-trained models are allowed for use in the competition provided the following
      are satisfied: (a) The external data and pre-trained models are unencumbered
      with legal restrictions that conflict with its use in the competition. And (b)

      Awards:</strong>&nbsp;There are multiple ways for Challenge leaders to win progressive
      prizes halfway through each marathon match and prior to the final round. Progressive
      prizes are announced when the Challenge is publicly launched and awarded based
      on the participants placement on the provisional leaderboard at an exact time
      (approximately half way through the challenge), and their provisional testing
      score (not the sequestered results).&nbsp; These prizes are awarded to the Top
      4 pre-certified participants from the provisional leaderboard once their code
      has been inspected.&nbsp; There are 4 progressive prizes available for each
      marathon match at $1000 each.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px; font-weight:
      400; padding-left: 60px;\">a. A Marathon Match is defined as a long-running
      crowdsourcing challenge, using the Topcoder website, where participants solve
      complex algorithms on large data sets. Participants submit their software code
      to create and optimize their algorithm.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;
      font-weight: 400; padding-left: 60px;\">b. A Leaderboard is an online, public
      display of the competition on the Topcoder website. Each marathon match will
      have a leaderboard where participants will receive immediate feedback about
      the quality of their submission. Participants can repeatedly improve their score
      and validate the capabilities of their algorithm by viewing the leaderboard.
      The leaderboard will display the participants handle, ranking and provisional
      score, at any given point in time. Additionally, the leaderboard will identify
      those teams or individuals who agree to make their submission (code) publicly
      available at the conclusion of this challenge; this is an option, not required
      to participate.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400; padding-left:

      funds are available to the NIST Judge panel, in the form of Additional Prizes,
      up to $20,000 and assessed at the end of the final marathon match.&nbsp; An
      additional prize of $4000 may be awarded to each of the top 5 award winning
      teams who agree to provide and do provide their full code solution in an open

  in a new challenge? Then join this exciting data privacy competition with <strong>up
  to $150,000 in prizes</strong>, where participants will create new or improved differentially
  private synthetic data generation tools.&nbsp; When a data set has important public
  value but contains sensitive personal information and can&rsquo;t be directly shared
  with the public, privacy-preserving synthetic data tools solve the problem by producing
  new, artificial data that can serve as a practical replacement for the original
  sensitive data, with respect to common analytics tasks such as clustering, classification
  and regression.&nbsp; By mathematically proving that a synthetic data generator
  satisfies the rigorous Differential Privacy guarantee, we can be confident that
  the synthetic data it produces won&rsquo;t contain any information that can be traced
  back to specific individuals in the original data.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Differential
  Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge&rdquo; will entail a sequence of three marathon
  matches run on the Topcoder platform, asking contestants to design and implement
  their own synthetic data generation algorithms, mathematically prove their algorithm
  satisfies differential privacy, and then enter it to compete against others&rsquo;
  algorithms on empirical accuracy over real data, with the prospect of advancing
  research in the field of Differential Privacy.</p>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not a differential
  privacy expert, and you&rsquo;d like to learn, join the Topcoder community for tutorials
  to help you catch up and compete!&nbsp; <strong>Join, learn, and compete for $150,000
  in prizes!</strong></p>\r\n<h3>How Important Is This?</h3>\r\n<p>This challenge
  is focused on proactively protecting individual privacy while allowing for public
  safety data to be used by researchers for positive purposes and outcomes.&nbsp;
  NIST&rsquo;s PSCR (public safety communications research) has strong commitments
  to both public safety research and the preservation of security and privacy, including
  the use of de-identification.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There is no absolute protection
  that data will not be misused.&nbsp; Even a dataset that protects individual identities
  may, if it gets into the wrong hands, be used for ill purposes.&nbsp; Weaknesses
  in the security of the original data can threaten the privacy of individuals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It
  is well known that privacy in data release is an important area for the Federal
  Government (which has an Open Data Policy), state governments, the public safety
  sector and many commercial non-governmental organizations.&nbsp; Developments coming
  out of this competition would hopefully drive major advances in the practical applications
  of differential privacy for these organizations.</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of this series
  of competitions is to provide a platform for researchers to develop more advanced
  differentially private methods that can substantially improve the privacy protection
  and utility of the resulting datasets.</p>\r\n<h3>Get Involved - How to Participate</h3>\r\n<p><em><span
  style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Open Sans, sans-serif;\">Note: All submissions
  for this challenge are being collected through the <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/Differential-Privacy-Synthetic-Data-Challenge\">Topcoder
  website</a>.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>The Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge
  is phase 2 of <a href=\"https://www.herox.com/UnlinkableDataChallenge/overview\">The
  Unlinkable Data Challenge: Advancing Methods in Differential Privacy</a>, where
  competitors wrote concept papers to identify new approaches to de-identification
  and inform the final coding design of this challenge.&nbsp; Participants of this
  challenge will create an algorithm and participate in a sequence of Marathon Matches.
  Throughout each marathon match, participants will design and implement their own
  differentially private synthetic data generation algorithm, mathematically prove
  that their algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and enter it to compete against
  others&rsquo; algorithms on empirical accuracy over real data, with the prospect
  of advancing the understanding in the field of Differential Privacy.</p>\r\n<p>This
  is a multi-phased contest with three marathon matches. Competitors may enter the
  contest at any point to participate between November 2018 and April 2019. Topcoder
  will bring the registrations from previous matches to the next matches.</p>\r\n<p>The
  marathon mechanism will provide participants with immediate feedback about the quality
  of their submission using an online leaderboard, which allows teams to repeatedly
  improve and validate the capabilities of their algorithms through several phases
  of increasing difficulty. In each marathon, participants are able to make changes
  to their algorithm, team with other Topcoder members and watch their opponents move
  up and down the leaderboard. The final stage in each marathon match will be a sequestered
  stage where participants submit their final code to be rigorously tested and evaluated.&nbsp;
  Where a competitor's algorithm falls with respect to the utility-privacy frontier
  curve will determine who wins at each marathon match.</p>\r\n<h3>Prize Schedule</h3>\r\n<p>The
  Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge consists of a sequence of three Marathon
  Matches with increasing difficulty. Each marathon match is approximately two months
  in length.&nbsp; For all prize eligibility, the submissions must be certified (see
  Match contest rule #8) in advance and the participants will have 24 hours to supply
  their code base to re-confirm their certifications.</p>\r\n<h4>Summary of Important
  Dates</h4>\r\n<p>Pre-registration Begins: October 5, 2018</p>\r\n<p>Challenge Launch:

  Deadline: April 2019 (Refer to Challenge Timeline on <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/Differential-Privacy-Synthetic-Data-Challenge\">Topcoder
  website</a>&nbsp;under each Match page)</p>\r\n<p>Final Winners Announced: May 20,
  2019 (Interim Match Winnners posted under the \"Winners\" tab)</p>\r\n<h3>How Do
  I Win?</h3>\r\n<p>To be eligible for an award, your submission must, at minimum:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Meet
  the eligibility requirements in the NIST PSCR Official Challenge Rules posted on
  Challenge.gov under the &ldquo;Rules&rdquo; tab.</li>\r\n<li>Satisfy compliance
  review based on completion of the Certification Process (Match contest rule #8)
  at each match, and if you are a top scorer, submit a report for Final Review (Match
  contest rule #9).</li>\r\n<li>Score higher than your competitors!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Prizes</h3>\r\n<p>A
  total prize purse of up to $150,000 is available for this Challenge. Here is a breakdown:</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Final
  Prizes</strong></h4>\r\n<p>For the final prize of each match the top participants&nbsp;(1st
  through 5th place) will be invited via email to the final round of testing, the
  sequestered phase, by providing their solution in the form of a Dockerfile within
  7 days of the end of the submission phase. This Dockerfile will contain their solution
  (source code) which will be run against the sequestered set of data and ground truth.&nbsp;
  A set of analytics will be run against the generated privatized data, and the same
  analytics will be run against the raw dataset.&nbsp; &nbsp;The results of the analytics
  (clustering, categorization, and linear regression) of the two sets of data will
  be compared using appropriate similarity scores, and a total accuracy score will
  be computed that represents the final score for that participant.&nbsp; The top
  leaders will be required to provide written documents defining their solution and
  providing a clear, correct proof that their solution satisfies differential privacy
  (see Match contest rule #9, Final Review).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Progressive
  Prizes</strong></h4>\r\n<p>There are multiple ways for Challenge leaders to win
  progressive prizes halfway through each match and prior to the final round. Progressive
  prizes are announced when the Challenge is publicly launched and awarded based on
  the participants placement on the provisional leaderboard at an exact time (approximately
  half way through the challenge), and their provisional testing score (not the sequestered
  results).&nbsp; These prizes are awarded to the Top 4 pre-certified participants
  from the provisional leaderboard once their code has been inspected.&nbsp; There
  are 4 progressive prizes available for each marathon match at $1000 each.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Additional
  Prizes</strong></h4>\r\n<p>An additional prize of $4000 may be awarded to each of
  the top 5 award winning teams at the end of the final marathon match who agree to
  provide and do provide their full code solution in an open source repository for
  use by all interested parties.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Prize Summary</strong></h4>\r\n<table
