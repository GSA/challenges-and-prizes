prize-description-1: The spread of antibiotic resistance can be slowed by reducing
  the time needed to administer an effective, targeted antibiotic to infected
  patients. Our response to the AMR Challenge is to produce a test that both confirms
  bacteremia caused by highly resistant strains, and provides a complete phenotypical
  antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) in a time that is radically shorter than
  today’s clinical standard. The test employs a microfluidic sensor that counts
  and weighs individual microbes at high throughput, and robustly measures bacterial
  culture growth at a speed limited only by the growth of the microbes themselves.
  It will provide clinically actionable information - confirming the presence
  of highly resistant bacteria and identifying the best targeted therapies - in
  hours or even minutes, vs. the current standard of 2-3 days. The initial targets
  will be CRE and ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae, but the test will be extensible
  to all high-value bacterial targets and any desired antibiotics, and to a variety
  of bodily sources of infection (e.g., bacteremia/sepsis, spinal and pleural
  fluid, urinary tract, etc.) Because it assesses growth phenotypically, the test
  will not be defeated by evolving resistance mechanisms, and will provide an
  essential complement to resistance biomarkers and organism identification. The
  outcome will be the fastest possible sample-to result phenotypical susceptibility
  test, with the potential to migrate from a laboratory/in-patient setting to
  the doctor’s office.

prize-description-10: 'Every year, citizens of the United States experience more
  than one billion infections of  the upper respiratory tract. Both viruses and
  bacteria can cause these illnesses but only  bacteria are susceptible to antibiotics.
  However, we do not have a simple, rapid,  comprehensive diagnostic test to distinguish
  between viral and bacterial upper  respiratory infections. Lack of such tests
  contributes to the fact that outpatient visits for  acute respiratory infection
  are the most common setting for inappropriate antibiotic  prescriptions in the
  U.S, with about half of these prescriptions (~35 million prescriptions  annually)
  not indicated1. Our recent findings indicate a way to develop a diagnostic test  to
  rapidly distinguish between viral and bacterial causes of respiratory illness
  while the  patient is in the doctor’s office. Unlike current tests, which detect
  the presence of  specific viruses, this approach measures the response of the
  patient’s airway cells to the  infection to indicate whether the body is fighting
  a viral infection or a bacterial infection.  This approach has two major advantages
  over current approaches: (1) many different  viruses and bacteria can cause
  similar respiratory symptoms, but the only tests currently  available are pathogen-specific.
  Therefore a single test can easily miss the organism  causing the patient’s
  illness, and testing for large panels of pathogens is complex and  can be prohibitively
  expensive; (2) unlike other proposed approaches to distinguish viral  and bacterial
  infections based on the body’s response, our approach does not require a  blood
  sample, but will work with a nose or throat swab. This test has tremendous  potential
  to transform ingrained practices of prescribing antibiotics for non-bacterial  illnesses
  by demonstrating the cause of infection to physician and patient during the  initial
  healthcare encounter, and therefore will provide a powerful tool for promoting  antimicrobial
  stewardship.'

prize-description-2: Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) seeks to reduce the unnecessary
  use of antibiotics by guiding healthcare practitioners in differentiating between
  bacterial and viral infections within the time constraints of a single outpatient
  visit. Building on the public-health utility and broad commercial success of
  the BD Veritor™ platform, we are developing a novel digital immunoassay (DIA)
  that will measure a panel of circulating host immune biomarkers from a single
  blood-based sample. The test is intended to be an aid in the management of patients
  with symptoms of infection – such as upper respiratory infection – for which
  antibiotic misuse is a widespread problem. By providing objective diagnostic
  evidence that the patient’s immune system is fighting either a bacterial or
  a viral infection, the test will return an informative result without requiring
  a sample from the site of infection, and without the time or expense of diagnostic
  confirmation of numerous possible candidate pathogens. By employing the sample-in/result-out,
  one-button simplicity of the CLIA-waived BD Veritor system, the test can be
  deployed broadly at point-of-care settings without the need for trained personnel.
  And by returning a result rapidly (target of ten minutes) at the point of care,
  the test outcome will enable an actionable decision before the patient leaves
  the site.

prize-description-3: Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the fourth leading
  cause of death worldwide, with 430--‐ 450 million cases and 3--‐ 4 million deaths
  per year. In the United States alone, there are 4--‐ 5 million CAP cases, 1.1
  million hospitalizations, and over 52,000 deaths annually, accounting for over
  $34 billion in direct health expenditures. Despite the high incidence of CAP,
  existing diagnostic tests for CAP are inadequate, identifying an underlying
  microbial pathogen in only 7--‐ 38% of cases. Even when a specific causal pathogen
  is identified, results often return long after it is necessary to make a clinical
  treatment decision. Because of the difficulty of identifying the microbial cause
  of pneumonia and the potentially severe consequences of not treating bacterial
  pneumonia promptly, clinicians often treat CAP  empirically with antibiotics,
  even though a large proportion of these cases are viral in etiology.  Unnecessary
  broad--‐ spectrum antibiotic prescriptions per year, in turn, fuel the emergence
  and spread of resistant bacteria, including most of the urgent and serious threat

prize-description-4: Click Diagnostics was founded with the mission to dramatically
  improve health outcomes   through innovative new diagnostic technology providing
  physicians with “patient-side” test   results enabling immediate and accurate
  treatment. Through dramatic miniaturization,   optimization, and cost reduction
  of laboratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, we   have created
  a fast, inexpensive, easy-to-use, single-use (disposable) diagnostic device.
  Think   “home pregnancy test,” but for nearly “any infectious disease.” Click
  has made patient-side   testing for infectious diseases almost as simple as
  taking a patient’s blood pressure. We expect   this to revolutionize health
  testing, moving molecular testing from laboratories and large   healthcare facilities
  to doctors’ offices and clinics, and eventually the home. Because the Click   device
  is fundamentally a PCR assay, products can be developed for most common infectious   diseases
  such as sexually transmitted infections (STI), hospital-acquired infections
  (HAI), and   respiratory infections. Our first product for detecting the STIs
  gonorrhea, chlamydia and   trichomoniasis is scheduled for clinical trial in
  2017. As part of the AMR challenge, we plan to   add a test for drug resistant
  gonorrhea to this panel. The CDC identifies drug resistant   gonorrhea as an
  urgent threat due to high levels of drug resistance and potential impact on   public
  health (1).

prize-description-5: Inappropriately prescribed antibacterials for viral respiratory
  illness contribute to increased healthcare costs, unnecessary drug-related adverse
  effects, and drive antimicrobial resistance. The inability to rapidly and reliably
  distinguish bacterial from viral or non-infectious etiologies is a major impediment
  to appropriate antibiotic use. Pathogen detection strategies can be helpful
  but are limited by poor sensitivity, long time-to-result, inability to distinguish
  infection from colonization, or restricted number of target pathogens. Peptide
  biomarkers such as procalcitonin may also be helpful but are poorly sensitive
  and specific. Consequently, these approaches have not adequately addressed the
  antibacterial overuse problem. We therefore propose an innovative solution focusing
  on the patient’s response to infection. New scientific advances can now capture
  the entirety of the host response using system-wide molecular surveys (e.g.,
  RNA, proteins, metabolites). We have developed analytical methods to define
  the stereotyped responses found within these highly complex and dense data.
  Applying these techniques to infection, we have shown the pattern of immune
  system response can distinguish bacterial, viral, and non-infectious etiologies.
  That response is most robustly detected in the patient’s gene expression profile,
  which is far more accurate than existing diagnostic tests. This strategy is
  only useful, however, if it can be measured rapidly, simply, and at the point-of-need.
  Supported by the Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group, Duke University
  and BioFire Diagnostics now propose such a test. This simple-to-use, 1-hour
  test distinguishes bacterial infection, viral infection, or neither so as to
  guide the appropriate administration of antibacterials at the point-of-need.
prize-name-6: First Light Biosciences, Inc.
prize-cash-amount-6: '50000'
prize-description-6: 'First Light Biosciences is addressing two critical issues
  in healthcare: the rise in superbugs that are re-sistant to most antibiotics
  and the epidemic of hospital acquired infections. Today, a large fraction of
  life threatening infections seen in hospitals are caused by pathogens that are
  resistant to multiple anti-biotics. Effective treatment and cure requires rapid
  diagnostics to detect infections and select appropri-ate antibiotics for treatment.
  Unfortunately, no such tests exist today. We propose to develop tests based
  on First Light’s MultiPath technology that can rapidly and affordably detect
  a broad range of in-fections, accurately identify the infectious agents, and
  determine the appropriate antibiotic for treat-ment. The MultiPath platform
  consists of an automated benchtop analyzer that accommodates a broad menu of
  application-specific consumable cartridges. The MultiPath technology is quantitative.
  In only 15 min it detects infections and identifies pathogens including bacteria,
  fungi, viruses, toxins, human cells, and biomarkers. The technology can determine
  the correct antibiotic therapy in just 4 hours in contrast to the several days
  required by current methods. While as sensitive as high performance cen-tral
  laboratory tests, the MultiPath tests are as rapid and as easy-to-use as point-of-care
  tests and re-quire no sample preparation. The proprietary MultiPath technology
  achieves high sensitivity and quan-tification by using digital non-magnified
  imaging to count fluorescently labeled cellular and molecular targets. The MultiPath
  Platform eliminates labile enzymatic reagents, biochemical purification, and
  liq-uid handling (including wash steps), reducing complexity and cost while
  increasing throughput. We pro-pose to develop high-performance easy-to-use tests
  for important diagnostic applications for initial commercialization in the hospital
  setting. The platform and tests will also have commercial and medical advantages
  in outpatient settings. For Step 2, we plan to: (1) develop MultiPath assays
  for Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) diagnostics, multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus
  aureus (MRSA) surveillance, and urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostics, (2)
  develop the MultiPath consumable cartridges for the three tests, (3) develop
  the benchtop automated MultiPath Analyzer, and (4) demonstrate the performance
  of the integrated MultiPath Analyzer and MultiPath Tests.'

  a single drop of human blood. In 2015 the concept was successfully demonstrated
  with blood samples from patients with acute fever where in only minutes patients
  with a bacterial infection could clearly be distinguished from those without.
  To make this marker available in the primary care setting, Philips is working
  to realize the whole blood based assay onto its Minicare system. The CE-marked
  Minicare system is a platform for rapid blood testing, consisting of a point-of-care
  analyser and cartridges supporting different types of tests. Finalization of
  product development is estimated at 2.5 - 3 years. Penn will confirm performance
  of the biomarker using U.S. clinical samples in a separate study. Once test
  development is complete, Penn will serve as the clinical study site to validate
  and register the test and to perform a health technology assessment measuring
  its impact in reducing unnecessary prescription of antibiotics.
prize-description-8: We propose InSpector-01 (~ a rapid test for characterizing
  the presence/absence of pathogenic microorganisms in blood and urine samples)
  and InSpector-02 (~ a rapid test for characterizing the functional MIC minimum
  inhibitory concentration of a candidate antimicrobial required to suppress the
  growth of the causative pathogen, even prior to that pathogen being isolated
  and identified). InSpector-01 would be used to test blood and urine samples,
  both in the outpatient and in the inpatient setting, and would identify patients
  for whom antimicrobial therapy is inappropriate. Thus, InSpector-01 can reduce
  inappropriate antimicrobial use for the vast majority of patients who are currently
  treated with antimicrobials, but who are uninfected. InSpector-02 would be used
  to characterize blood samples in the inpatient setting for the functional MIC
  of the causative pathogen, so as to guide subsequent antimicrobial therapy (from
  the 2nd antimicrobial dose on). Both InSpector-01 and InSpector-02 offer unique
  capabilities ~ we are not aware of any other current/emerging methods that can
  identify patients for whom antimicrobial therapy is inappropriate (as InSpector-01
  does) or current/emerging methods that can provide the functional MIC (as InSpector-02
  does; other methods provide markers of specific resistance mechanisms). Both
  InSpector-01 and InSpector-02 are at an advanced stage of development, and are
  currently being field tested to develop a quality system necessary for distribution.

prize-description-9: More accurate tests for microbiologic diagnosis of acute
  respiratory infections (ARI) are needed. Acute respiratory infections occur
  commonly throughout life, accounting for substantial morbidity and mortality
  in adults, and these infections are a leading cause of antibiotic overuse. Unnecessary
  antibiotic use is a major driver of the increase in antimicrobial resistance,
  which is considered to be one of the most urgent threats to global public health.
  In most cases of ARI, the precise microbial etiology is unknown and antibiotics
  are administered empirically in illness in both inpatient and outpatient settings.
  Although sensitive molecular diagnostics such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
  allow clinicians to rapidly and accurately diagnose a wide variety of respiratory
  viruses, their impact on patient management and antibiotic prescription has
  been modest primarily due to concern about bacterial co-infection. Sensitive
  and specific diagnostic tests for bacterial lung infection are currently lacking.
  Clinical parameters such as fever, purulent sputum, white blood cell count and
  radiographic patterns do not provide sufficient precision to reliably distinguish
  viral from bacterial infections. Thus, “ruling out” bacterial respiratory infection
  is extremely difficult, resulting in a default position of prescribing antibiotics
  to almost all patients hospitalized with respiratory infection and many outpatients
  as well. This practice results in significant antibiotic overuse, with resultant
  adverse effects and increased antimicrobial resistance. Recently, serum biomarkers
  such as procalcitonin have shown some promise as a supplement to clinical judgment
  in assessing patients with ARI but a need for more accurate tests remains. Gene
  expression profiling of whole blood represents a powerful new approach for analysis
  of the host response during infection. Preliminary studies indicate that viruses
  and bacteria may trigger specific host transcriptional patterns in blood, yielding
  unique “bio-signatures” that may discriminate viral from bacterial causes of
  infection. This approach can be used to supplement pathogen detection allowing
  clinicians to target antibiotic use for those patients that need treatment and
  thereby reducing unnecessary antibiotic use and resultant antimicrobial resistance.
  New rapid molecular diagnostics that incorporate detection of common respiratory
  viruses and bacteria combined with a limited number host genes discriminatory
  for bacterial and viral infection will be developed. The eventual goal is to
  simplify testing such that point of care ARI diagnostics can be employed in
  hospitals, emergency rooms, clinics and physicians’ offices for the maximal
  impact on patient care and antibiotic prescription.

winner-solution-link-5: ''
winner-solution-description-5: 'First Light Biosciences is addressing two critical
  issues in healthcare: the rise in superbugs that are re-sistant to most antibiotics
  and the epidemic of hospital acquired infections. Today, a large fraction of
  life threatening infections seen in hospitals are caused by pathogens that are
  resistant to multiple anti-biotics. Effective treatment and cure requires rapid
  diagnostics to detect infections and select appropri-ate antibiotics for treatment.
  Unfortunately, no such tests exist today. We propose to develop tests based
  on First Light’s MultiPath technology that can rapidly and affordably detect
  a broad range of in-fections, accurately identify the infectious agents, and
  determine the appropriate antibiotic for treat-ment. The MultiPath platform
  consists of an automated benchtop analyzer that accommodates a broad menu of
  application-specific consumable cartridges. The MultiPath technology is quantitative.
  In only 15 min it detects infections and identifies pathogens including bacteria,
  fungi, viruses, toxins, human cells, and biomarkers. The technology can determine
  the correct antibiotic therapy in just 4 hours in contrast to the several days
  required by current methods. While as sensitive as high performance cen-tral
  laboratory tests, the MultiPath tests are as rapid and as easy-to-use as point-of-care
  tests and re-quire no sample preparation. The proprietary MultiPath technology
  achieves high sensitivity and quan-tification by using digital non-magnified
  imaging to count fluorescently labeled cellular and molecular targets. The MultiPath
  Platform eliminates labile enzymatic reagents, biochemical purification, and
  liq-uid handling (including wash steps), reducing complexity and cost while
  increasing throughput. We pro-pose to develop high-performance easy-to-use tests
  for important diagnostic applications for initial commercialization in the hospital
  setting. The platform and tests will also have commercial and medical advantages
  in outpatient settings. For Step 2, we plan to: (1) develop MultiPath assays
  for Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) diagnostics, multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus
  aureus (MRSA) surveillance, and urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostics, (2)
  develop the MultiPath consumable cartridges for the three tests, (3) develop
  the benchtop automated MultiPath Analyzer, and (4) demonstrate the performance
  of the integrated MultiPath Analyzer and MultiPath Tests.'
winner-solution-title-6: 'Minicare HNL: Point-of-care Detection of Bacterial Infections
  to Curb Unnecessary Use of Antibiotics'
winner-name-6: Philips North America
winner-solution-description-6: "Philips and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn)
  jointly propose development of a rapid, pointof-care system to reliably rule
  out bacterial infection at primary care within minutes to avoid the unnecessary
  use of antibiotics. Between 80-90% of all antibiotics are prescribed in a primary
  care1 setting. Given the current misuse of antibiotics and related antimicrobial
  resistance, primary care settings can play an important role in reducing unnecessary
  antibiotic prescriptions2. Despite the benefits of using a point-of-care test
  to detect infectious disease biomarkers, adoption in primary care remains modest3.
  The reason for low adoption is that currently available biomarkers have low
  levels of clinical performance (i.e., sensitivity and specificity) and available
  tools require advanced skills to operate.\r\n\r\nPhilips is developing a unique
  approach to reliably detect bacterial infection at the point of care\r\nusing
  a fast and easy-to-use test. The solution is designed to detect the biomarker
  Human\r\nNeutrophil Lipocalin (HNL) on a diagnostic platform from a single drop
  of human blood. In 2015 the concept was successfully demonstrated with blood
  samples from patients with acute fever where in only minutes patients with a
  bacterial infection could clearly be distinguished from those without. To make
  this marker available in the primary care setting, Philips is working to realize
  the whole blood based assay onto its Minicare system. The CE-marked Minicare
  system is a platform for rapid blood testing, consisting of a point-of-care
  analyser and cartridges supporting different types of tests. Finalization of
  product development is estimated at 2.5 - 3 years. Penn will confirm performance
  of the biomarker using U.S. clinical samples in a separate study. Once test
  development is complete, Penn will serve as the clinical study site to validate
  and register the test and to perform a health technology assessment measuring
  its impact in reducing unnecessary prescription of antibiotics.\r\n"

winner-solution-link-7: ''
winner-solution-description-7: 'We propose InSpector-01 (~ a rapid test for characterizing
  the presence/absence of pathogenic microorganisms in blood and urine samples)
  and InSpector-02 (~ a rapid test for characterizing the functional MIC minimum
  inhibitory concentration of a candidate antimicrobial required to suppress the
  growth of the causative pathogen, even prior to that pathogen being isolated
  and identified). InSpector-01 would be used to test blood and urine samples,
  both in the outpatient and in the inpatient setting, and would identify patients
  for whom antimicrobial therapy is inappropriate. Thus, InSpector-01 can reduce
  inappropriate antimicrobial use for the vast majority of patients who are currently
  treated with antimicrobials, but who are uninfected. InSpector-02 would be used
  to characterize blood samples in the inpatient setting for the functional MIC
  of the causative pathogen, so as to guide subsequent antimicrobial therapy (from
  the 2nd antimicrobial dose on). Both InSpector-01 and InSpector-02 offer unique
  capabilities ~ we are not aware of any other current/emerging methods that can
  identify patients for whom antimicrobial therapy is inappropriate (as InSpector-01
  does) or current/emerging methods that can provide the functional MIC (as InSpector-02
  does; other methods provide markers of specific resistance mechanisms). Both
  InSpector-01 and InSpector-02 are at an advanced stage of development, and are
  currently being field tested to develop a quality system necessary for distribution. '
winner-solution-description-8: More accurate tests for microbiologic diagnosis
  of acute respiratory infections (ARI) are needed. Acute respiratory infections
  occur commonly throughout life, accounting for substantial morbidity and mortality
  in adults, and these infections are a leading cause of antibiotic overuse. Unnecessary
  antibiotic use is a major driver of the increase in antimicrobial resistance,
  which is considered to be one of the most urgent threats to global public health.
  In most cases of ARI, the precise microbial etiology is unknown and antibiotics
  are administered empirically in illness in both inpatient and outpatient settings.
  Although sensitive molecular diagnostics such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
  allow clinicians to rapidly and accurately diagnose a wide variety of respiratory
  viruses, their impact on patient management and antibiotic prescription has
  been modest primarily due to concern about bacterial co-infection. Sensitive
  and specific diagnostic tests for bacterial lung infection are currently lacking.
  Clinical parameters such as fever, purulent sputum, white blood cell count and
  radiographic patterns do not provide sufficient precision to reliably distinguish
  viral from bacterial infections. Thus, “ruling out” bacterial respiratory infection
  is extremely difficult, resulting in a default position of prescribing antibiotics
  to almost all patients hospitalized with respiratory infection and many outpatients
  as well. This practice results in significant antibiotic overuse, with resultant
  adverse effects and increased antimicrobial resistance. Recently, serum biomarkers
  such as procalcitonin have shown some promise as a supplement to clinical judgment
  in assessing patients with ARI but a need for more accurate tests remains. Gene
  expression profiling of whole blood represents a powerful new approach for analysis
  of the host response during infection. Preliminary studies indicate that viruses
  and bacteria may trigger specific host transcriptional patterns in blood, yielding
  unique “bio-signatures” that may discriminate viral from bacterial causes of
  infection. This approach can be used to supplement pathogen detection allowing
  clinicians to target antibiotic use for those patients that need treatment and
  thereby reducing unnecessary antibiotic use and resultant antimicrobial resistance.
  New rapid molecular diagnostics that incorporate detection of common respiratory
  viruses and bacteria combined with a limited number host genes discriminatory
  for bacterial and viral infection will be developed. The eventual goal is to
  simplify testing such that point of care ARI diagnostics can be employed in
  hospitals, emergency rooms, clinics and physicians’ offices for the maximal
  impact on patient care and antibiotic prescription.

winner-solution-title-8: Transcriptional Profiling to Distinguish Bacterial and
  Viral Respiratory Infection
winner-solution-link-9: ''
winner-solution-description-9: "Every year, citizens of the United States experience
  more than one billion infections of\r\nthe upper respiratory tract. Both viruses
  and bacteria can cause these illnesses but only\r\nbacteria are susceptible
  to antibiotics. However, we do not have a simple, rapid,\r\ncomprehensive diagnostic
  test to distinguish between viral and bacterial upper\r\nrespiratory infections.
  Lack of such tests contributes to the fact that outpatient visits for\r\nacute
  respiratory infection are the most common setting for inappropriate antibiotic\r\nprescriptions
  in the U.S, with about half of these prescriptions (~35 million prescriptions\r\nannually)
  not indicated1. Our recent findings indicate a way to develop a diagnostic test\r\nto
  rapidly distinguish between viral and bacterial causes of respiratory illness
  while the\r\npatient is in the doctor’s office. Unlike current tests, which
  detect the presence of\r\nspecific viruses, this approach measures the response
  of the patient’s airway cells to the\r\ninfection to indicate whether the body
  is fighting a viral infection or a bacterial infection.\r\nThis approach has
  two major advantages over current approaches: (1) many different\r\nviruses
  and bacteria can cause similar respiratory symptoms, but the only tests currently\r\navailable
  are pathogen-specific. Therefore a single test can easily miss the organism\r\ncausing
  the patient’s illness, and testing for large panels of pathogens is complex
  and\r\ncan be prohibitively expensive; (2) unlike other proposed approaches
  to distinguish viral\r\nand bacterial infections based on the body’s response,
  our approach does not require a\r\nblood sample, but will work with a nose or
  throat swab. This test has tremendous\r\npotential to transform ingrained practices
  of prescribing antibiotics for non-bacterial\r\nillnesses by demonstrating the
  cause of infection to physician and patient during the\r\ninitial healthcare
  encounter, and therefore will provide a powerful tool for promoting\r\nantimicrobial
  stewardship.\r\n"
