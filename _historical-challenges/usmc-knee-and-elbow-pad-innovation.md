description: "<p><img src=\"/assets/images/ids-images/Knee--Elbow-LinkedIn.jpg\" width=\"919\"
  height=\"481\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Marine
  Corps seeks new and innovative ideas and solutions that improve the currently fielded
  knee and elbow pads&rsquo; comfort. &nbsp;The current knee and elbow pads secure
  to the leg or arm with elastic bands, negatively affecting comfort, maneuverability,
  and stability. &nbsp;Knee and elbow pad ideas and solutions that enhance the Marines&rsquo;
  comfort, maneuverability, and stability, and can either integrate into the trousers
  and blouse or are stand-alone items are sought.</p>\r\n<p>The desired end-state
  is to determine a design or concept that provides improved comfort, impact protection
  and operator acceptance, while maintaining mobility and operator&rsquo;s range of
  motion.</p>\r\n<p>If the Marine Corps can identify a new or an innovative knee and
  elbow pad solution that demonstrates outstanding achievements in basic, advanced,
  applied research and technology development, the Marine Corps will award a prize
  as detailed below and will consider procuring the system through a full and open
  competition resulting in a Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)-based contract.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Operational
  Environment:&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n<p>Marines are expected to effectively operate
  in both wet and dry climates with a temperature range of extreme heat to extreme
  cold.&nbsp; Knee and elbow blunt force, and abrasion protection is especially valuable
  during military operations on urban terrain or in areas where the ground consists
  of rocks, rubble, concrete, broken glass, shrapnel or other hard irregular and or
  protruding surfaces that could present significant risks to a Marine's knees and
  elbows.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Performance Requirements:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The
  knee and elbow pads should demonstrate new or innovative materials over current
  systems.</li>\r\n<li>The knee and elbow pads should not interfere with the normal
  operation of the extremities.</li>\r\n<li>The knee and elbow pads should conform
  to the natural shape of the knee and elbow.</li>\r\n<li>The protective shell of
  the knee and elbow pad should prevent damage to the knee and elbow caused by impact
  with hard surfaces during normal movement.</li>\r\n<li>Pads should not cause constriction
  or chaffing.</li>\r\n<li>Candidate's submissions should not damage nor adversely
  affect the appearance nor the utility of the Marine Corps&rsquo; combat uniform.&nbsp;
  Integrated solutions/modifications to existing uniforms are permitted provided integrated
  solutions/modifications do not adversely affect the uniform during wear.</li>\r\n<li>The
  following NSNs are provided and are representative of the knee and elbow pads that
  have been cataloged, and are currently in use by the Marine Corps:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pad,
  Knee: 8415-01-515-0364</li>\r\n<li>Pad, Elbow: 8415-01-515-0222</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>The
  following NSNs are provided and are representative of the current Marine Corps combat
  uniform (MCCU) (size Medium-Regular):\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Blouse, Woodland, MARPAT, Camouflage:
  8415-01-527-1452</li>\r\n<li>Trousers, Woodland, MARPAT, Camouflage: 8415-01-527-1848</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>The
  knee and elbow pads should limit, to the greatest extent possible without impacting
  form, fit, function, and comfort, any adjustment necessary due to movement.</li>\r\n<li>The
  knee and elbow pads should remain in their intended locations on the knee or elbow
  while walking, running, using stairs/ladders and/or crawling.</li>\r\n<li>Knee and
  elbow pads should be capable of accommodating users of varying shapes and sizes
  and shall fit the anthropometric measurements of the 2nd percentile female Marine
  through the 98th percentile male Marine.</li>\r\n<li>Shall be compliant with the
  Berry Amendment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Questions
