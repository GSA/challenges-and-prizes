  participated!&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017/06/06/onc-announces-winners-privacy-policy-snapshot-challenge.html\">Read
  the press release announcing the winners.</a></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong>&nbsp;The
  Privacy Policy Snapshot Challenge is a call for designers, developers, and health
  data privacy experts to create an online Model Privacy Notice (MPN) generator. The
  MPN is a voluntary, openly available resource designed to help health technology
  developers who collect digital health data clearly convey information about their
  privacy and security policies to their users. Similar to a nutrition facts label,
  the MPN provides a snapshot of a product&rsquo;s existing privacy practices, encouraging
  transparency and helping consumers make informed choices when selecting products.
  The MPN does not mandate specific policies or substitute for more comprehensive
  or detailed privacy policies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/privacysnapshotinfowebinar\">Watch
  the recording</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2jYWok1\">download the slides</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;the
  informational and Q&amp;A webinar on Thursday, January 12</strong></p>\r\n<p>In
  2011, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC)
  collaborated with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and released a Model Privacy
  Notice focused on personal health records (PHRs), which were the emerging technology
  at the time (<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/model-privacy-notice-mpn#2011phr\">view&nbsp;2011
  PHR MPN</a>). The project&rsquo;s goals were to increase consumers&rsquo; awareness
  of companies&rsquo; PHR data practices and empower consumers by providing them with
  an easy way to compare the data practices of two or more PHR companies. In the last
  five years, the health information technology market has changed significantly and
  there is now a larger variety of products such as mobile applications and wearable
  devices that collect digital health data.</p>\r\n<p>ONC recognized a need to update
  the MPN to make it applicable to a broad range of consumer health technologies beyond
  PHRs. More and more individuals are obtaining access to their electronic health
  information and using consumer health technology to manage this information. As
  retail products that collect digital health data directly from consumers are used,
  such as exercise trackers, it is increasingly important for consumers to be aware
  of companies&rsquo; privacy and security policies and information sharing practices.
  Health technology developers can use the MPN to easily enter their information practices
  and produce a notice to allow consumers to quickly learn and understand privacy
  policies, compare company policies, and make informed decisions. Many consumer health
  technologies are offered by organizations that are not subject to the Health Insurance
  Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy and security standards. This
  is detailed in the HHS report,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/non-covered_entities_report_june_17_2016.pdf\">Examining
  Oversight of the Privacy &amp; Security of Health Data Collected by Entities Not
  Regulated by HIPAA</a>, released in July 2016 by ONC&rsquo;s Office of the Chief
  Privacy Officer with the cooperation of the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and
  the FTC.</p>\r\n<p>The&nbsp;Privacy Policy Snapshot Challenge&nbsp;leverages updated
  content developed recently by ONC, with feedback from OCR, FTC, and other private
  and public stakeholders. The content also underwent informal consumer testing. The
  Privacy Policy Snapshot Challenge provides an award to the creators of the best
  MPN generator that produces a customizable MPN for health technology developers.
  The Challenge is a call for designers, developers, and health data privacy experts
  to create an online MPN generator that is easy for health technology developers
  to use in customizing a privacy notice that is compelling and understandable to
  consumers. Submissions will provide the code for an open source, web-based tool
  that allows health technology developers who collect digital health data to generate
  a customized privacy notice. The MPN generator must be able to produce privacy notices
  that adhere to the MPN content yet provide for customization by a health technology
  developer.&nbsp;Visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2016_model_privacy_notice.pdf\">https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2016_model_privacy_notice.pdf</a>&nbsp;to
  download the MPN.&nbsp;You can find more information about the development of the
  2016 MPN&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/model-privacy-notice-mpn\">ONC's
  MPN page</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The code for the web-based generator must be posted to GitHub
  and be available through the open source&nbsp;<a href=\"http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/\">MIT
  License 1.0</a>&nbsp;such that any app developer can implement and use it. The solution
  should be developed as an HTML webpage styled using CSS (or SASS)&nbsp;that is powered
  by a framework, library, or plugin developed in JavaScript that is packaged and
  made available as one of the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>JQuery Plugin</li>\r\n<li>Node.JS
  Module</li>\r\n<li>Standalone Script</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The final output of a successful
  submission is an MPN generator that can create customized privacy notices that would
  be accessible from an app or other consumer health technology; the privacy notices
  must, following the MPN, inform and educate the app or technology user so that they
  understand how the app or technology uses their personal health data. What the privacy
  notices created by the MPN generator look like and how they educate the user is
  up to the submitter &ndash; for example, the notices can be interactive or use graphics
  and images; however, it cannot be a simple static document such as a pdf. The MPN
  generator should create privacy notices that factor in accessibility, clean web
  design, and the differences between reading and understanding content on paper versus
  online, for which resources like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://health.gov/healthliteracyonline/\">Health
  Literacy Online</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://standards.usa.gov/getting-started/\">Draft
  U.S. Web Design Standards</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usability.gov/\">Usability.gov&nbsp;</a>can
  be helpful. Submitters are also required to undertake consumer testing of the final
  customizable MPN produced by the MPN generator, which is intended to help bring
  in direct user feedback. Testing can be formal (such as standardized assessments
  or focus groups) or informal (such as among family members or individuals in a waiting
  room).</p>\r\n<p>Submitters must provide evidence of testing with at least five
  people. A larger amount of time spent with each tester, greater formal rigor, and
  the number and diversity of people used for testing will result in a more positive
  assessment under the selection criteria. Evidence demonstrating consumer testing
  could include sample feedback, quotes, or pictures, and should include how it affected
  development of the language, design, and/or structure of the customizable MPN. Resources
  like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/\">https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/</a>&nbsp;can
  help.</p>"
