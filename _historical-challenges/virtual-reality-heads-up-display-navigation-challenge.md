      not review or consider ineligible Concept Papers. NIST makes an independent
      assessment of each Concept Paper based on the evaluation criteria. During the
      review, each subject matter expert reviewer will review entire concept papers
      to which they are assigned. The review is not done in sections with different
      reviewers responsible for different assigned sections. Therefore, it is not
      necessary to repeat information in every part of the concept paper. Do not include
      sensitive materials in the concept paper, for example personally identifiable
      information like social security numbers, business sensitive information like
      tax id numbers, etc.  <h3>CONTESTANT ELIGIBILITY:</h3>  To be eligible for the
      cash prizes, each contestant or team of contestants must include an individual
      age 18 or older at the time of entry and a U.S. citizen or permanent resident
      of the United States or its territories. In the case of a private entity, the
      business shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in
      the United States or its territories.  Contestants may not be a Federal entity
      or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment.  NIST Guest
      Researchers, as well as direct recipients of NIST funding awards through any
      Center of Excellence established by NIST, are eligible to enter, but are not
      eligible to receive cash awards. Non-NIST Federal employees acting in their
      personal capacities should consult with their respective agency ethics officials
      to determine whether their participation in this Competition is permissible. 
      Contestants, including individuals and private entities, must not have been
      convicted of a felony criminal violation under any Federal law within the preceding
      24 months and must not have any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed,
      for which all judicial and administrative remedies have been exhausted or have
      lapsed, and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement
      with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability. Contestants
      must not be suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded from doing business with
      the Federal Government.  Multiple individuals and/or legal entities may collaborate
      as a group to submit a single entry and a single individual from the group must
      be designated as an official representative for each entry.  That designated
      individual will be responsible for meeting all entry and evaluation requirements.  <h3>TEAMS:</h3>  Contest
      submissions can be from an individual or a team(s). If a team of individuals,
      a corporation, or an organization is selected as a prize winner, NIST will award
      a single dollar amount to the winning Team(s) and each Team, whether consisting
      of a single or multiple contestants, is solely responsible for allocating any
      prize amount among its member contestants as they deem appropriate. NIST will
      not arbitrate, intervene, advise on, or resolve any matters between entrant
      members. It will be up to the winning Team(s) to reallocate the prize money
      among its member contestants, if they deem it appropriate.  <h3>SUBMISSION RIGHTS:</h3>  Any
      applicable intellectual property rights to a submission will remain with the
      Contestant.  By participating in the prize challenge, the Contestant is not

      RULES OF WORKING CONCEPT AND HUD PROTOTYPE CONTEST (stage 2)</h1>  <h2>Introduction:</h2>  The
      Working Concept and HUD Prototype contest will be open to up to 30 invited contestants.
      Contestants will bring their concept to life by creating the software code for
      compliance testing, based on a Vive Unreal VR environment, and evaluation of
      general usability and functionality. Contestants can create their working concept
      HUD prototype in any compliant environment. Based on the compliance testing
      and functional evaluation, up to 16 contestants will be invited to participate
      in the next contest, HUD Prototype Test &amp; Evaluation Round 1.  <h2>Important
      Dates:</h2>  https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/virtual-reality-heads-up-display-navigation-challenge/  <h2>How
      to Enter:</h2>  <ul>    <li>Complete the research and coding required for your

      to meet the compliance criteria will be disqualified and will be ineligible
      to compete in this contest. Submissions that pass the initial compliance review
      will be evaluated and scored by a panel of judges. An evaluation of a submission
      by a panel of judges does not constitute the NIST''s final determination of
      contestant or submission eligibility.    Submissions will be judged according
      to the three scoring criteria below:  <h3>Scoring Criteria #1: Compliance Testings
      (pass/Fail)</h3>  <ul>    <li>The compliance testing includes a series of checks
      to ensure that users will not experience simulator sickness while completing
      the required reviews and judging. There are a series of checks including VR
      movement speed, environment colors and textures, and other criteria listed in
      the best practices for VR environments.</li>    <li>Each contestant entry will
      be reviewed against this check list for VR environments on the Unreal Engine.

      will provide up to 16 contestants with a fully functional VR environment, scenario
      details (i.e., Law Enforcement Hostage and Fire Fighter Earthquake) and operational
      parameters for fire (i.e., Oxygen levels, temperatures, victim location, hazard
      locations) and law enforcement scenarios (i.e., hostage location, partner location,
      threat location, time-based hazard) to contestants for interactive testing and
      evaluation of their initial HUD prototype. Each contestant’s HUD prototype must
      meet UI/UX and functional navigation elements, for example, oxygen/time-based
      hazard and temperature for fire. The contestants are encouraged to collaborate
      with mentors and advisors and complete a series of interactive tests and evaluations
      to improve their prototype. Up to 10 contestants will be invited to the HUD
      Prototype Test &amp; Evaluation Round 2 contest. Contestants invited will receive
      travel funding to attend the June 2018 PSCR Stakeholders Meeting, up to $4,000
      per contestant or team, and compete in the final contest of the challenge.  <h2>Important
      Dates:</h2>  https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/virtual-reality-heads-up-display-navigation-challenge/  <h2>How

      RULES OF HUD PROTOTYPE TEST &amp; EVALUATION ROUND 2 (stage 4)</h1>  <h2>Introduction:</h2>  Contestants
      will complete a series of live demonstrations using their HUD prototype in NIST
      PSCR’s virtual reality environment at the June 2018 PSCR Stakeholders Meeting.
      Each contestant will have the opportunity to attend the meeting, interact with
      over 500 meeting contestants who represent all segments of the Public Safety
      community, and compete for up to seven (7) cash prizes. HUD prototypes will
      be tested and evaluated by the NIST PSCR Judge panel for final awards (1st Place
      $25,000; 2nd $20,000; 3rd $15,000; 4th $10,000; 5th $7,500; 6th $5,000; 7th
      $2,500).  <h2>Important Dates:</h2>  https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/virtual-reality-heads-up-display-navigation-challenge/  <h2>How
      to Enter:</h2>  <ul>    <li>Invited contestants will receive an email with information
      on how to access the PSCR environment, and details regarding each scenario.</li>    <li>Each
      contestant will independently integrate their HUD prototype in the PSCR environment
      and complete a series of compliance and functional evaluations to access the
      effectiveness of their design.</li>    <li>To document these independent compliance
      tests and functional evaluations, each contestant will complete a series of
      short recording of their tests, and complete live demonstration of their work
      with PSCR reviewers and the contest judges.</li>  </ul>  <h2>Evaluation Criteria
      and Judging:</h2>  PSCR will initially screen submissions for compliance with
      the objectives and Official Rules of this contest. A submission that fails to
      meet the compliance criteria will be disqualified and will be ineligible to
      compete in this contest. Submissions that pass the initial compliance review
      will be evaluated and scored by a panel of judges. An evaluation of a submission
      by a panel of judges does not constitute the NIST''s final determination of
      contestant or submission eligibility.    Submissions will be judged according
      to the five scoring criteria below:  <h3>Scoring Criteria #1: Compliance Testings
      (pass/Fail)</h3>  <ul>    <li>The compliance testing includes a series of checks
      to ensure that users will not experience simulator sickness while completing
      the required reviews and judging. There are a series of checks including VR
      movement speed, environment colors and textures, and other criteria listed in
      the best practices for VR environments.</li>    <li>Each contestant entry will
      be reviewed against this check list for VR environments on the Unreal Engine.
      Contestant’s should use this checklist as well to ensure they are compliant
      and their entry is ready for review and judging.  <ul>    <li>https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Platforms/VR/ContentSetup/index.html</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  <h3>Scoring
      Criteria #2: HUD FUnctionality Indicators (Max 20/100)</h3>  <ul>    <li>Integration
      of key data into the HUD that supports key elements of the public safety mission:
      reviewers will evaluate: each contestant’s demonstrated knowledge of public
      safety requirements, missions, operations, and tasks.</li>    <li>The quality,
      content, and quantity of data elements integrated into the HUD, the use of this
      data to enable users to make decisions, and how this data interfaces with navigational
      and non-navigational functions.</li>    <li>PSCR will provide up to 16 contestants
      a fully functional VR environment, scenario information including, for example:  <ul>    <li>Law
      Enforcement Hostage: operational parameters for law enforcement include hostage
      location, partner location, threat location, and time-based hazards.</li>    <li>Fire
      Fighter Earthquake: operational parameters for fire include oxygen levels in
      the fire fighter’s self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), temperatures within
      the VR environment, victim location, and hazard locations.</li>    <li>For both
      scenarios, the HUD must include a functional settings menu to enable the users
      to toggle through choices which customize the HUD. For example, color, font
      size, icon size, etc.</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  <h3>Scoring Criteria #3: HUD
      Navigation FUnction (Max 20/100)</h3>  <ul>    <li>The integration of data elements
      within the HUD for use in navigational functions.</li>    <li>Effectiveness
      of the data analysis, ability to calculate navigational routes, assess risks,
      and manage those risks to increase the safety of the First Responder utilizing
      the technology.</li>    <li>The quality of the UI/UX utilize for navigation
      tasks within the HUD.</li>    <li>Ability to toggle through different navigation
      settings, for example waypoint, breadcrumb, map, floor plan, etc.</li>    <li>Ability
      to toggle through different objectives, for example find partner, find exit,
      etc. depending on scenario and calculate multiple routes that update on the
      fly in response to a changing environment. The routes may include the lowest
      risk, fastest, highest risk, etc. and the updating function will enable nearly
      real-time navigation of the environment.</li>  </ul>  <h3>Scoring Criteria #4:
      Responsive to Scenario (Max 50/100)</h3>  <ul>    <li>Each contestant will be
      assigned a series of tasks as part of the scenario to complete within the PSCR
      VR environment. These tasks are assigned to test the capabilities of the HUD
      and its navigation calculations. Scoring will include three components:  <ul>    <li>Completion
      of objectives (for example navigate to partner, navigate to victim, navigate
      to exit)</li>    <li>Navigation of risks (for example did the route assigned
      minimize risks, did it balance risk with time, etc.)</li>    <li>Total time;
      how long did it take to complete the scenario</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  <h3>Scoring
      Criteria #5: Judge Panel Q&amp;A (Max 10/100)</h3>  Each contestant will complete

description: '<strong>Submissions have been extended to 9 p.m. ET, Monday, Jan. 29. </strong>    Join
  us for this exciting VR (virtual reality) prize competition using your ingenuity,
  software coding and VR expertise to create a concept for a heads-up display (HUD)
  with unimpeded visual aids.  The result of the<strong> First Responder Virtual Reality
  (VR) Heads-up-Display (HUD) Navigation Challenge </strong>will support the public
  safety community and its stakeholders.    You (the contestant) will showcase your
  VR skills and create a solution that helps advance User Interface (UI) technology
  through research.  UI is “the means by which a user and a technology system interact;
  including how users input, access, and navigate data and communications through
  the technology.”  Examples of UIs are haptic feedback mechanisms (e.g., sound, vibration),
  vocal commands, and visual indicators (e.g., heads-up displays).  Historically,
  UI design has been broad and rarely targeted for Public Safety however, it’s critical

  following is only a summary of each contest. For more information please review
  the full details of each contest terms and conditions as provided throughout this
  document.  <h4>STAGE 1: Concept Paper Contest</h4>  The Concept Paper Contest invites
  all eligible contestants to complete a concept paper outlining their knowledge,
  skills, capabilities and approach for this challenge. The contest will be divided
  into two groups; concepts for Firefighters and concepts for Law Enforcement. Contestants’
  concept papers will be reviewed by a panel of subject matter experts and judges
  to select those contestants to be invited to the challenge kickoff webinar. Contestants
  selected by the judge panel will be eligible to move forward to the Working Concept
  and HUD Prototype contest.  <h4>STAGE 2: Working Concept and HUD Prototype</h4>  The
  Working Concept and HUD Prototype contest will be open to up to 30 invited contestants.
  Contestants will bring their concept to life by creating the software code for compliance
  testing, based on a Vive Unreal VR environment, and evaluation of general usability
  and functionality. Contestants can create their working concept HUD prototype in
  any compliant environment. Based on the compliance testing and functional evaluation,
  up to 16 contestants will be invited to participate in the next contest, HUD Prototype
  Test &amp; Evaluation Round 1.  <h4>STAGE 3: HUD Prototype Test &amp; Evaluation
  Round 1</h4>  PSCR will provide up to 16 contestants with a fully functional VR
  environment, scenario details (i.e., Law Enforcement Hostage and Fire Fighter Earthquake)
  and operational parameters for fire (i.e., Oxygen levels, temperatures, victim location,
  hazard locations) and law enforcement scenarios (i.e., hostage location, partner
  location, threat location, time-based hazard) to contestants for interactive testing
  and evaluation of their initial HUD prototype. Each contestant’s HUD prototype must
  meet UI/UX and functional navigation elements, for example, oxygen/time-based hazard
  and temperature for fire. The contestants are encouraged to collaborate with mentors
  and advisors and complete a series of interactive tests and evaluations to improve
  their prototype. Up to 10 contestants will be invited to the HUD Prototype Test
  &amp; Evaluation Round 2 contest. Contestants invited will receive travel funding
  to attend the June 2018 PSCR Stakeholders Meeting, up to $4,000 per contestant or
  team, and compete in the final contest of the challenge.  <h4>STAGE 4: HUD Prototype
  Test &amp; Evaluation Round 2</h4>  Contestants will complete a series of live demonstrations
  using their HUD prototype in NIST PSCR’s virtual reality environment at the June
  2018 PSCR Stakeholders Meeting. Each contestant will have the opportunity to attend
  the meeting, interact with over 500 meeting contestants who represent all segments
  of the Public Safety community, and compete for up to seven (7) cash prizes. HUD
  prototypes will be tested and evaluated by the NIST PSCR Judge panel for final awards
  (1st Place $25,000; 2nd $20,000; 3rd $15,000; 4th $10,000; 5th $7,500; 6th $5,000;
  7th $2,500).'
