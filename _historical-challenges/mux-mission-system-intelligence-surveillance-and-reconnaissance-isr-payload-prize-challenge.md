description: "<p><span lang=\"EN\">The ISR mission system payload prize challenge
  aims to identify ISR mission system payloads that will 1) Maximize payload performance
  to meet or exceed MUX mission system desired payload performance levels, 2) Minimize
  mission payload Size, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWaP-C) requirements, 3) Maximize
  mission system payload(s) modularity, 4) Minimize mission payload maintainability
  and sustainability requirements, 5) Maximize mission system payload reliability,
  6) Maximize a mission system payload's ability to be reconfigured and/or upgraded
  to adapt to and address emergent threats to the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF)
  in highly contested environments, 7) Provide a mission systems model(s), and 8)
  Minimize implementation, and Operations and Support (O&amp;S) cost(s).</span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">The ISR mission system payload prize challenge will leverage model-based
  systems engineering (MBSE) methods.&nbsp; The prize challenge will be conducted
  in two phases:&nbsp; initial qualification and final submission evaluation.&nbsp;
  During the initial qualification phase, interested participants must submit an initial
  application in order for the Government to determine whether the interested participant
  is eligible to receive the Government-Furnished Information and starter model.&nbsp;
  During the final submission phase, invited participants will be provided with a
  starter model generated in No Magic Cameo Enterprise ArchitectureTM, Version 19.0
  (Unified Architecture Framework (UAF)).&nbsp; Participants will extend the starter
  model to substantiate their payload design concept and submit the extended model
  to be scored against a standardized grading rubric. Participants will also submit
  a written description of their model that includes mapping of requirements and capabilities
  to UAF views, along with a list of supporting physics-based relationships and assumptions.&nbsp;
  </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Within the written description, participants
  must also address questions about compliance with </span><span lang=\"EN\">Federal
  Acquisition Regulation and Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation
  Supplement requirements and provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for the cost
  to develop the proposed payload and for the cost to produce the payload on a per
  unit basis.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The Government intends to award
  the prizes to the proposals that comply with the requirements of the prize challenge
  and, all factors considered, provide the greatest overall benefit to the Government.</span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">A full description of the submission requirements and evaluation criteria
  can be found at </span><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"http://www.navair.navy.mil/muxchallenge\">http://www.navair.navy.mil/muxchallenge</a></span><span
