  - prize-description-0: Since the 1990s, Lake Erie has been experiencing increased
      water quality impairment, primarily in the form of extensive toxic cyanobacterial
      blooms.  To combat the growing impacts on the ecosystem health and services
      of these tremendous natural resources, the Governments of Canada and the United
      States developed revised binational phosphorus reduction targets for Lake Erie
      with a goal of 40% lower loading rates then established under the 2012 Great
      Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA). To determine progress toward meeting
      nutrient reduction targets and verifying the response in the lake, active surveillance
      of nutrients in the lake is essential. Phosphorus concentrations in Lake Erie
      are highly variable in time and space, making it difficult to determine long-term
      trends. Deployment of continuous monitoring sensors to provide nearly continuous
      data will be a critical component of successful nutrient management.

      nitrate plus nitrite data collected near Portland's East End to provide data
      applicable to evaluating the impact of the East End discharges on Casco Bay,
      clarify the relative importance of riverine inputs, wastewater discharges, stormwater,
      and combined sewer overflows as sources of nutrients to the waters around Portland,
      support Maine DEP's RP analyses, provide information on the range of nutrient
      concentrations experienced by eelgrass beds, and provide data to support development
      of a better model of nutrient processes in Casco Bay.

  - prize-description-2: The League of Women Voters of Jo Daviess County in Illinois
      (LWV-JDC) has been actively seeking water quality data in order to increase
      local knowledge. The ultimate goal is to achieve science-based stewardship of
      local water resources. This project proposes that two sensors be deployed, one
      each at the top and bottom of the Lower Galena River subwatershed to gather
      continuous data on nitrate levels in this portion of the Galena River. The League
      has been building relationships throughout the area for over six years and those
      relationships will provide valuable avenues for communicating the results of
      the data obtained through continuous nitrate monitoring.  These data will be
      used as a basis for shifting landowners to best management practices designed
      to reduce nutrient pollution.

  - prize-description-3: Current understanding of how reservoirs affect nitrogen moving
      through river systems is based on a small number of studies in larger reservoirs.
      These studies also looked at annual estimates rather than evaluating how nutrient
      retention varied through time. Dams and their reservoirs are increasingly being
      removed from the landscape, often because they are aging and would need costly
      repairs, have no significant utility and/or to improve anadromous fish passage
      and connectivity with spawning areas. Because reservoirs created by dams are
      potentially effective at removing nitrogen, such dam removals come with tradeoffs,
      including reduced nitrate removal. We propose to deploy sensors upstream and
      downstream of several reservoirs in coastal New England to quantify nitrate
      removal across seasons and storm events. We will also take advantage of ongoing
      dam removals and management activities to quantify the nitrogen removal by reservoirs.

    prize-name-4: Upper Chesapeake Bay - University of Maryland Center for Environmental

    prize-description-4: The Chesapeake Bay estuary has a long history of degraded
      water quality associated with elevated inputs of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P),
      and sediments from its large watershed that spans six states and the District
      of Columbia. The Conowingo Dam, which is located in the lower Susquehanna River
      - the Bay's largest source of nutrients and freshwater - is decreasingly effective
      at holding back silt from entering the Upper Chesapeake Bay. As a result, additional
      nutrients associated with those silts are entering Chesapeake Bay and nutrient
      and sediment reduction strategies are being developed to address the increased
      nutrient load. The impact of these "new" nutrient inputs to Chesapeake Bay,

      the Upper Chesapeake Bay and provide much data on how the nutrient load changes

      and associated oxygen depletion in the estuary.

  - winner-solution-description-0: Since the 1990s, Lake Erie has been experiencing
      increased water quality impairment, primarily in the form of extensive toxic
      cyanobacterial blooms.  To combat the growing impacts on the ecosystem health
      and services of these tremendous natural resources, the Governments of Canada
      and the United States developed revised binational phosphorus reduction targets
      for Lake Erie with a goal of 40% lower loading rates then established under
      the 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA). To determine progress
      toward meeting nutrient reduction targets and verifying the response in the
      lake, active surveillance of nutrients in the lake is essential. Phosphorus
      concentrations in Lake Erie are highly variable in time and space, making it
      difficult to determine long-term trends. Deployment of continuous monitoring
      sensors to provide nearly continuous data will be a critical component of successful
      nutrient management.

      use high frequency nitrate plus nitrite data collected near Portland's East
      End to provide data applicable to evaluating the impact of the East End discharges
      on Casco Bay, clarify the relative importance of riverine inputs, wastewater
      discharges, stormwater, and combined sewer overflows as sources of nutrients
      to the waters around Portland, support Maine DEP's RP analyses, provide information
      on the range of nutrient concentrations experienced by eelgrass beds, and provide
      data to support development of a better model of nutrient processes in Casco
      Bay.

      in Illinois (LWV-JDC) has been actively seeking water quality data in order
      to increase local knowledge. The ultimate goal is to achieve science-based stewardship
      of local water resources. This project proposes that two sensors be deployed,
      one each at the top and bottom of the Lower Galena River subwatershed to gather
      continuous data on nitrate levels in this portion of the Galena River. The League
      has been building relationships throughout the area for over six years and those
      relationships will provide valuable avenues for communicating the results of
      the data obtained through continuous nitrate monitoring.  These data will be
      used as a basis for shifting landowners to best management practices designed
      to reduce nutrient pollution. '

    winner-solution-description-3: Current understanding of how reservoirs affect
      nitrogen moving through river systems is based on a small number of studies
      in larger reservoirs. These studies also looked at annual estimates rather than
      evaluating how nutrient retention varied through time. Dams and their reservoirs
      are increasingly being removed from the landscape, often because they are aging
      and would need costly repairs, have no significant utility and/or to improve
      anadromous fish passage and connectivity with spawning areas. Because reservoirs
      created by dams are potentially effective at removing nitrogen, such dam removals
      come with tradeoffs, including reduced nitrate removal. We propose to deploy
      sensors upstream and downstream of several reservoirs in coastal New England
      to quantify nitrate removal across seasons and storm events. We will also take
      advantage of ongoing dam removals and management activities to quantify the
      nitrogen removal by reservoirs.

    winner-solution-title-4: Monitoring the Effects of Storms and Conowingo Dam Inputs
      on Nutrients in the Upper Chesapeake Bay
    winner-solution-description-4: The Chesapeake Bay estuary has a long history of
      degraded water quality associated with elevated inputs of nitrogen (N), phosphorus
      (P), and sediments from its large watershed that spans six states and the District
      of Columbia. The Conowingo Dam, which is located in the lower Susquehanna River
      - the Bay's largest source of nutrients and freshwater - is decreasingly effective
      at holding back silt from entering the Upper Chesapeake Bay. As a result, additional
      nutrients associated with those silts are entering Chesapeake Bay and nutrient
      and sediment reduction strategies are being developed to address the increased
      nutrient load. The impact of these "new" nutrient inputs to Chesapeake Bay,
      however, remains poorly understood. This project would place two sensors in
      the Upper Chesapeake Bay and provide much data on how the nutrient load changes
      over time and in response to storm events. This can help validate models and
      give insight into the effect these nutrients will have on phytoplankton production
      and associated oxygen depletion in the estuary.
