description: "<h4>Background</h4>\r\n<p>Manufacturing is important for America&rsquo;s
  prosperity. It is estimated that for every dollar spent in U.S. manufacturing, another
  $1.89 is added to the economy; the highest multiplier effect of any economic sector.
  Manufacturing accounts for millions of jobs and about 12% of the nation&rsquo;s
  Gross Domestic Product. With all that economic activity, the industrial sector accounted
  for about one-third of total U.S. energy consumption in 20173. Making smart energy
  investments will enhance our nation&rsquo;s security, productivity, and energy independence.
  For manufacturers, every dollar saved allows for investment in production, facilities,
  and jobs that ultimately makes U.S. companies more competitive and resilient. Improving
  the energy performance of manufacturing facilities has a broad impact; savings from
  reduced operating expenses can be reinvested in technology upgrades and new jobs.</p>\r\n<p>Finding
  ways to cut costs through energy savings seems like an obvious strategy; however,
  many times these opportunities go unrealized due to competing demands for capital,
  plant personnel, lack of information, or lack of attention/prioritization. Nevertheless,
  all across America, manufacturers are showing real leadership, stepping up as champions
  of energy savings and sustainability. The success of these efforts do not happen
  without strong leadership from individuals working in the manufacturing facilities,
  who step up to recognize and implement energy saving opportunities, and who find
  innovative approaches to push through barriers they encounter along the way.</p>\r\n<p>The
  U.S. Department of Energy&rsquo;s (DOE&rsquo;s) Individuals Taking Energy Action
  in Manufacturing (ITEAM) Prize competition seeks to identify and attract attention
  to a wide range of ideas and practices that are driving measureable energy savings
  at U.S. manufacturing plants to stimulate innovation at other facilities. To do
  so, DOE is launching the ITEAM Prize competition as a means to:</p>\r\n<p>(1) Find
  individuals who were responsible for creative, specific, and innovative ideas and
  practices that led to significant, measurable energy savings at their manufacturing
  facilities; and</p>\r\n<p>(2) Encourage those individuals to widely share their
  ideas and practices for the benefit of U.S. Manufacturing facilities nationwide.</p>\r\n<p>Through
  the ITEAM Prize competition, DOE is seeking the ideas and best practices from employees
  on the plant floor all around the country who not only recognize the importance
  of saving energy but are making it happen, strengthening their company&rsquo;s competitiveness
  and driving cost savings in the process. By sharing successful strategies and examples
  of leadership, more manufacturers can drive energy productivity improvements and
  accelerate the adoption of energy efficient technologies.</p>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<h4>Q&amp;A</h4>\r\n<p><strong>1.
  The application deadline is 6 months from now.&nbsp; Is there any advantage to submitting
  an application now?</strong></p>\r\n<p>No.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Can
  I nominate the leader of our team, that was just recognized for a Better Project
  Award?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Recognition for a Better Project Award does not
  impact eligibility under the ITEAM Prize competition. DOE does not make eligibility
  determinations prior to receiving a complete submission. Participants should view
  the prize rules and assess whether their submission meets the eligibility requirements.</p>\r\n<p>Individuals
  may submit an entry on their own behalf. DOE will also accept an entry from a U.S.
  manufacturing facility that identifies an individual employee taking energy action
  at its manufacturing facility. However the prize itself will only be issued to the
  individual responsible for the winning ideas and practices that led to significant,
  measurable energy savings at the manufacturing facility, and not to the manufacturing
  facility.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Can we submit multiple applications (i.e. individuals
  from multiple facilities)?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Yes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Can the
  cash prize be given to our company foundation instead of the individual?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Individuals
  may submit an entry on their own behalf. DOE will also accept an entry from a U.S.
  manufacturing facility that identifies an individual employee taking energy action
  at its manufacturing facility. However the prize itself will only be issued to the
  individual responsible for the winning ideas and practices that led to significant,
  measurable energy savings at the manufacturing facility, and not to the manufacturing
  facility.</p>\r\n<p>Applicants will have the option to decline the cash prize if
  selected and still be recognized as a winner and participate in the events and activities
  described above.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5.&nbsp;This information states that plant floor
  people, but the qualifications do not get very specific. What about staff engineering
  people? An example would be a lighting engineer who leads and guides all facilities
  discussion related to lighting efficiency improvements at all plants.</strong></p>\r\n<p>The
  competition is open to individual employees taking energy action at the manufacturing
  facility where they are employed. The rules do not restrict the job positions/titles
  of the participants. DOE will also accept an entry from a U.S. manufacturing facility
  that identifies an individual employee taking energy action at its manufacturing
  facility. However the prize itself will only be issued to the individual responsible
  for the winning ideas and practices that led to significant, measurable energy savings
  at the manufacturing facility, and not to the manufacturing facility. Please see
  the prize rules for a complete list of the eligibility requirements.</p>"
