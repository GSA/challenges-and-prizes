      originality of designs. An innovative approach may be novel, groundbreaking,
      or paradigm-shifting, or a creative application of existing approaches. For
      Phase 1 submissions, the approach should also be feasible; i.e., have a high
      likelihood to succeed in meeting or exceeding the scientific evaluation criteria
      NEI has defined. Overall, the solution should provide a novel solution to building
      a 3-D human retina that meets the desired scientific criteria (structure, function,
      morphology). Reviewers will be asked to specifically address:    Impact on potential
      end users, clinical implications, and therapeutic advances —To what extent will
      the solution exert a sustained, powerful influence on the understanding of retinal
      diseases and accelerating research toward new therapies?  To what extent does
      the solution address a significant barrier in the development of human retina
      organoids that are highly representative of human physiology? Does the approach
      speed up organoid development and differentiation time, improve yield, or increase
      production?  How is the solution unique and does it improve upon state of the
      science for organoid technology?  To what extent are novel concepts, approaches,
      methodologies, technologies or instrumentation used, or are existing approaches
      applied in a novel way?  To what extent are cross-discipline techniques integrated
      to produce a 3-D human retina organoid prototype that addresses the scientific
      evaluation criteria? (applicable to Phase 1 only)  Will the innovative solution
      and team executing it allow all scientific criteria to be met within the timeframe
      of the Challenge? Are any limitations to the approach discussed and addressed?

      of a healthy-native retina and is viable through formation of photoreceptor
      outer segments and/or long-term survival of retinal ganglion cells with extension
      of axonal processes. Reviewers will be asked to address:    Cell Types:  How
      many neuronal (or neuronal derived) cell types are stably co-cultured (rod and
      cone photoreceptors, bipolar cells, ganglion cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine
      cells, Muller glia)? Are long-term viable and functional RPE, choroid or non-neuronal
      cell types (e.g., pericytes, microglia, astrocytes) incorporated? To what extent
      does the evidence presented show presence of cell types and 3-dimensional structure.
      If a cell type is lacking, is there justification for why it is not present
      and not needed for proof of principle (i.e. the disease being modelled lacks
      the specific cell type)?  Structure: Are organoid prototypes 3-dimensional and
      properly oriented? To what extent do the synaptic layers recapitulate those
      of a laminated retina with multiple neuron classes present in numbers and proportions
      that represent an in vivo setting (as indicated by biomarkers of lineage and
      differentiation)? How many other retina and retina-relevant tissues, cells,
      or structures are included?  Functional characterization of cell types: Are
      all cell types in the organoid (or added to the organoid) functional through
      the latest viable timepoint as shown by appropriate analyses, including electrophysiology
      (e.g., light response and recovery for subsequent responses, etc.), retinoid
      recycling, cell communication, functional connectivity, fluid transport in RPE,

  - judging-criteria-description-3: 'BIOLOGY/DISEASE MODELING (note: NEI is agnostic
      to which disease is chosen, as long as technology is developed to robustly recapitulate
      the disease):    Does the organoid prototype demonstrate improvement in faithful
      biological complexity (e.g. macula, multiple cell subtypes present in physiologically
      similar ratios, etc.)?  Does the model recapitulate some aspect of disease phenotype
      in one or more assays?  Viability and scalability: If grown at one organoid/well,
      are 90% of organoids in a plate viable, as shown by random sampling in five
      wells across a dish? For how long are morphological and functional features
      maintained? Are methods that increase the production (e.g., many dozens) of
      organoids and/or allow the distribution of well-characterized organoids presented
      to enable multiple organoids to be compared in the same experiment?  Is therapeutic
      intervention to treat the disease modelled with 3-D retina organoids (e.g. via
      gene editing, small molecules, cell replacement, etc.) demonstrated?  HIGH CONTENT
      SCREENING:    Are retina organoid prototypes amenable to high content screening,
      which may include high content imaging, drug validation/toxicology, or functional
      genomic screening (e.g. does not include materials known to show strong compound
      adsorption)?  Does the model recapitulate known retina toxicities based on morphological
      and functional readouts?  Scalability and portability: Are organoids grown at
      medium throughput (e.g., in a 96-well plate) robust? When grown at one organoid/well,
      are 90% of wells in a plate viable, as shown by random sampling in five wells
      across a dish? For how long are morphological and functional features maintained?

description: "<p>The National Eye Institute (NEI), part of the National Institutes
  of Health, is seeking in vitro, stem-cell derived 3-D human retina organoids. The
  goal of the challenge is to generate concrete prototypes of 3-D systems that model
  the cellular organization and function of the human retina.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Solvers
  will have 2 opportunities to submit solutions and win prizes. </strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Phase
  1 deadline:<strong>&nbsp;October 1, 2018 at 2:00 pm ET</strong></li>\r\n<li>Phase
  2 deadline: <strong>March 2, 2020 at 2:00 pm ET</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Evaluation
  criteria are the same for both phases; at each deadline, teams can submit a solution
  that includes data supporting the scientific evaluation criteria they have accomplished
  to date. Full description, rules, and details of this prize competition are defined
  on <strong><a href=\"https://nei.nih.gov/content/2018-reduction-practice-challenge\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NEI&rsquo;s challenge details</a></strong>
  page.</p>\r\n<p>NEI is seeking innovative solutions that achieve significant advances
  over currently available retina organoids. Solutions must show publication-quality
  data demonstrating:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A 3-D human retina organoid system that mimics
  the physiological and morphological features of the in vivo biology, consists of
  the major retina cell types (rod and cone photoreceptors, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine,
  and ganglion cells and Muller glia) with appropriate lamination and synaptic organization,
  and represents their biological functions and interplay. Components (neurons, retinal
  pigment epithelium [RPE], glia) may be produced separately or dissociated and recombined
  (1) if protocol is driven by a valuable biological question and (2) if in the process
  of re-assembly, specific functions/roles of cell types are delineated. Three-dimensional
  assembly may be achieved using various approaches, for example through self-organization
  that recapitulates natural development (&ldquo;true organoid&rdquo;) or through
  bioengineering with scaffolds, bioprinting, and/or microfluidic apparatuses.</li>\r\n<li>Retina
  organoids that are generated entirely from human cells (e.g. derived from iPSCs,
  hESCs, multipotent cells, or adult cells subjected to a combination of transdifferentiation/reprogramming
  methods).</li>\r\n<li>Modeling and treating retinal disease, or testing and developing
  drug (i.e., high content screening) therapies.</li>\r\n<li>Find detailed evaluation
  criteria <a href=\"https://nei.nih.gov/content/2018-reduction-practice-challenge\">here</a>&nbsp;under
  \"Evaluation and Winner Selection\"</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Explants are not of interest
  for this Challenge. Tissue-on-a-chip systems that use cells grown in 2-D co-culture
  and do not fully represent the structure, morphology, and function of the human
  retina are also not of interest. However, creative approaches that incorporate use
  of microfluidics or perfusion to enhance culture or extend duration of survival
  for 3-D organoid systems are acceptable.</p>\r\n<p>Reviewers will be asked to use
  the following criteria when evaluating whether (in the form of results, graphs,
  images, etc.) a prototype 3-D human retina organoid meets evaluation criteria:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Significant
  advances over currently available protocols in areas such as duration of culture,
  yield, and maturity/differentiation of all cell types in appropriate numbers and
  ratio.</li>\r\n<li>Potential impact on understanding the biology of the retina.</li>\r\n</ul>"
