      as outlined on the Challenge website will disqualify the contest submission.
      Team winnings, as determined by the Challenge sponsor, will be distributed to
      the designated team lead for further distribution to team members. In the event

      and where the employer is, or could be, exercising some control, directly or
      indirectly, over the activities of the employee. Employees should consult their

  Magnetic Model?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Earth is a giant magnet.
  Compasses &mdash; both digital and analog &mdash; are oriented by the magnetic force
  at a user&rsquo;s location. Since geographic and magnetic poles do not align, geomagnetic
  models like the World Magnetic Model (WMM) correct for this difference.</span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">As the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field is constantly changing, the difference
  between geographic and magnetic north also changes, and the WMM must be regularly
  updated.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">An opportunity to rethink geomagnetic
  data collection</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Production of the WMM
  currently uses space-based magnetic field measurements that the European Space Agency
  (ESA) Swarm mission has provided since 2013. Swarm mission satellites contain several
  instruments capable of producing a variety of measurements, including magnetic vector
  field measurements. To ensure sustainability of the WMM, the U.S. government is
  taking a proactive approach to identifying new methods of data collection independent
  of Swarm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">The World Magnetic Model is
  used every day around the world</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The
  WMM is embedded in thousands of systems. More than a billion smartphone users depend
  on the WMM to point them in the right direction when they use mobile navigation
  apps. Drivers rely on the WMM to power the compasses in their cars. The WMM is also
  critical for military and commercial uses around the world. Among other applications,
  it supports navigation and attitude determination for submarines, satellites, and
  aircraft, while also informing operational logistics like the numbering of runways.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span
  lang=\"EN\">MagQuest, a multiphase open innovation challenge</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) calls upon solvers
  to submit novel approaches to geomagnetic data collection for the World Magnetic
  Model. This open innovation challenge is designed to attract new ideas to increase
  the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of geomagnetic data collection.
  With MagQuest, NGA aims to inspire domestic and international solvers to apply their
  expertise to spaceborne, aerial, terrestrial, and other potential solution areas.
  Solvers from small businesses, academic institutions, labs, startups, and other
  organizations are encouraged to enter the competition. (See Additional Resources
  for an overview of potential solution areas.)</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Challenge
  Phases (Overview)</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">MagQuest Phases 1-2
  (March 2019 through September 2019) will award a total of $1.2 million.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span
  lang=\"EN\">Phase 1</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Phase 1 will be open
  to all eligible solvers. In Phase 1:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">The
  challenge seeks concepts that propose novel methods or technologies that may be
  promising to provide sufficient data for the WMM.</span></li>\r\n<li>Submissions
  open March 21, 2019 and close May 16, 2019.</li>\r\n<li>Up to ten (10) winners will
  be selected by the judges according to official Phase 1 selection criteria. The
  total Phase 1 prize pool of $200,000 will be distributed evenly across Phase 1 winners.</li>\r\n<li>As
  part of their acceptance of the associated Phase 1 monetary prize, winners agree
  to have a brief synopsis of their concept published on the MagQuest website.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em><span
  lang=\"EN\">Phase 2</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Phase 2 will be open
  to solvers from Phase 1, as well as new solvers who did not participate in the first
  phase of the challenge. Success in Phase 2 may require increased expertise, and
  participants will have an opportunity to form expanded teams. More information on
  potential team collaboration will be provided at the outset of Phase 2.</span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">In Phase 2:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">The challenge
  will seek detailed designs and plans for data collection methodologies, including
  descriptions, 3D models, and hypotheses for prototype development and testing.</span></li>\r\n<li>Submissions
  are expected to open June 2019 and close August 2019.</li>\r\n<li>Up to five (5)
  winners will be selected by the judges according to official Phase 2 selection criteria.
  The total Phase 2 prize pool of $1 million will be distributed across Phase 2 winners.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span
