description: 'The purpose of this Challenge -- "A Wearable Alcohol Biosensor: A Second
  Challenge" -- is to produce a prototype of a sleek, unobtrusive wearable capable
  of monitoring blood alcohol, non-invasively, and in real time. Such a device would
  significantly advance current alcohol monitoring capabilities. Highest priority
  will be given to devices that use non-invasive technologies to measure alcohol concentration
  in the blood or interstitial fluids, as opposed to detection of alcohol exuded through
  the skin in sweat or vapor. We welcome creative approaches -- surprise us!'
