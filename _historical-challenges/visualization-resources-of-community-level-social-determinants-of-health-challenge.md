  lang=\"EN\">AHRQ seeks&nbsp;to better understand unmet health service delivery needs
  in communities and develop ways to predict these needs at the population level.
  Understanding population-level behavior in relation to health care decision making
  is necessary for providing integrated, coordinated, whole person, 360-degree care;
  yet, information to support decision making about how to provide the quality health
  care to populations is incomplete. Evidence has suggested that </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"

  three or more free, publicly available data source, whether federal, state or local.

  for community services. <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p

  tools should be constructed and presented so that AHRQ can apply them in at least
