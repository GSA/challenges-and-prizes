    rules: 'The Official Rules are posted in the Federal Register and copied below
      for your convenience. In the unlikely event of a discrepancy, the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/19/2016-30437/announcement-of-requirements-and-registration-for-national-institute-of-standards-and-technology">Federal
      Register Notice</a> is the official documentation of the rules for the RAMP
      Challenge.    At the time of Entry, participants must meet the following Eligibility
      Rules:    To be eligible for a cash prize, the Official Representative (individual
      or team lead, in the case of a group project) must be age 18 at the time of
      entry and a U.S. citizen or permanent resident of the United States. In the
      case of a private entity, the business shall be incorporated in and maintain
      a primary place of business in the United States or its territories.  Participants
      may not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their
      employment. Eligibility excludes NIST employees and NIST Researcher Associates
      as well as direct recipients of NIST funding awards to collaborate on the development
      of the ASTM standard E3012-16. Non-NIST Federal employees acting in their personal
      capacities should consult with their respective agency ethics officials to determine
      whether their participation in this Competition is permissible.  Employees of
      the NSF, the ASTM, and the ASME Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference
      (MSEC) Conference Organizers are excluded from participating but members of
      these organizations are eligible to enter.  Any other individuals or legal entities
      involved with the design, production, execution, distribution or evaluation
      of the RAMP Challenge are not eligible to participate.    A Participant shall
      not be deemed ineligible because the Participant consulted with Federal employees
      or used Federal facilities in preparing its submission to the RAMP Challenge
      if the employees and facilities are made available to all Participants on an
      equitable basis.    Multiple entries are permitted.  Each entry will be reviewed
      independently.  Multiple individuals and/or legal entities may collaborate as
      a group to submit a single entry, in which case a single individual must be
      designated as the official representative and must satisfy all of the eligibility
      requirements.  That designated individual will be responsible for determining
      eligibility (covered above) and for meeting all entry and evaluation requirements.
       The participants must register to participate and must comply with all 15 U.S.C.
      3719 requirements. Participation is subject to all U.S. federal, state and local
      laws and regulations.  Individuals entering on behalf of or representing a company,
      institution or other legal entity are responsible for confirming that their
      entry does not violate any policies of that company, institution or legal entity.    <strong>Entry
      Process for Participants</strong>    As stated earlier, the RAMP Challenge calls
      on participants to model any manufacturing process for purposes of information
      sharing and sustainability assessment.  The modeled process can be one that
      the submitter has uniquely studied, or from open literature or other 3<sup>rd</sup>
      party sources.    To enter, the participant must create an account at challenge.gov
      and visit the Event Website, <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ramp-reusable-abstractions-of-manufacturing-processes/">https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ramp-reusable-abstractions-of-manufacturing-processes/</a>.
      The participant must submit an analysis of a Unit Manufacturing Process that
      uses the ASTM E60.13 E3012-16 Standard Guide for Characterizing Environmental
      Aspects of Manufacturing Processes, and that meets the criteria described herein.    A
      complete Entry must be in pdf format and include your analysis (including any
      figures, tables, and references), the name and email address of the Participant
      who is officially representing the Entry, names of any additional team members
      and a team name (if applicable) that is chosen by the team members, and confirmation
      that you have read and agree to the Competition Rules contained in this Notice.
      Participants may provide submissions to the Event Website.  Submissions can
      be made no later than 11:59 PM ET on April 17, 2017, to the Event Website.    Entries
      submitted before the start date and time, or after the end date and time, will
      not be evaluated or considered for award.  Entries sent to NIST in any manner
      other than through the Event Website will not be evaluated or considered for
      award.  Entries that do not comply with the formatting requirements set forth
      in this Notice will not be evaluated or considered for award.    Entries must
      be complete, must not contain any confidential information and must be in English.    In
      general, each Entry must:  <ol>    <li>a) have all Participants agree to be
      governed by the Competition rules and only the single participant and official
      representative need to meet the eligibility requirements to win a prize under
      15 USC 3719;</li>    <li>b) include an original model of the manufacturing process
      by application of ASTM E60.13 E3012-16 Standard Guide for Characterizing Environmental
      Aspects of Manufacturing Processes. Specifically, the Entry must include:</li>    <li>a
      project title page including project name, the name(s) of Participant(s), and
      the email address and phone number of the Participant who is officially representing
      the Entry,</li>    <li>a Unit Manufacturing Process (UMP) information model.
      A UMP is defined as the smallest element or sub-process in manufacturing that
      adds value through the modification or transformation of shape, structure, or
      property of input material or workpiece. Examples of a UMP are injection molding,
      die-casting and machining. A die-casting UMP can have individual operations
      such as die-preparation, clamping, injection, cooling, and ejection. A machining
      UMP can have multiple operations such as drilling, milling, or grinding.</li>    <li>a
      written narrative (fewer than 1500 words) describing how the Entry meets the
      Review Criteria described below in the Review Criteria section, and</li>    <li>an
      optional brief description of relevant case studies (fewer than 750 words) and/or
      a weblink (YouTube or Vimeo) to an original short (fewer than five minutes)
      video that describes the Entry. Participants must have permission to use all
      content in the video, including footage, music and images.</li>  </ol>  &nbsp;    <em>Guidelines
      for UMP Representation to be Provided in the Entry</em>    &nbsp;    Participants
      should choose any manufacturing process to demonstrate the application of a
      UMP representation using ASTM E60.13 E3012-16. ASTM is providing access to this
      standard free of charge for the purpose of the RAMP Challenge. You can obtain
      a copy of the standard for use in the RAMP Challenge by emailing Stephen Mawn
      (<a href="mailto:smawn@astm.org">smawn@astm.org</a>). The standard is further
      described in a Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering paper titled
      “Standard representations for sustainability characterization of industrial
      processes.”  The paper may be downloaded from the NIST website: https://www.nist.gov/node/1090636).
      Examples of typical representations will be posted at the Event Website.    For
      the identified UMP information model described in Section b-2 above, include:  <ol>    <li>Graphical
      Representation: The four elements shown in the E3012-16 standard must be clearly
      identified in the graphical representation:  <ol>    <li>Inputs: Identify inputs.
      Create an example of inputs represented in a structured form such as JSON or
      XML.</li>    <li>Outputs: Identify outputs. Output must include 1 or more metrics,
      such as energy, cost, tear and wear, and CO2 emissions. Create an example of
      output represented in a structured form such as JSON or XML.</li>    <li>Product
      and Process Information: Identify the necessary product and process information
      that would be required to instantiate the transformation functions, such as
      CAD files, CAM files, technical drawings, and specifications sheets.</li>    <li>Resources:
      Identify specific manufacturing assets, such as machines, tools, and operators,
      that would be required to instantiate the transformation functions.</li>  </ol>  </li>    <li>Transformation
      Function: Describe a series of equations that compute the output from the input.
      The transformation function can be expressed in any readable mathematical format,
      such as using MS Word, LaTeX, ASCII text, or more formally in a language such
      as JSONiq or Matlab.</li>    <li>Nomenclature: Describe the nomenclature of
      the inputs/outputs represented in the structured form as well as the computed
      values in the transformation functions. This should include information such
      as names of the computed values, its meaning, type of the input variable, and
      the unit in which the data is represented in the model.</li>    <li>Validation:
      Explain how the model is validated. An example of validation includes procuring
      the data (i.e., inputs and outputs) from a physical (or virtual) manufacturing
      setting and validate this output against the computed output from the transformation
      function that is run with inputs from the real manufacturing setting. Compute
      the degree of error between the outputs from the model and the real manufacturing
      setting.  Other approaches may be taken.</li>    <li>Novelty of UMP analysis:
      The main category is listed in bold type with various examples included for
      clarity.  <ol>    <li>Advancements to <strong>knowledge and understanding of
      UMP modeling</strong> through innovative and expressive representations and
      methodologies, novel formal representations, more accurate or specialized metric,
      metric representations that support cascading to higher production levels, or
      exploration of variations for families of UMP models.</li>    <li>Advancements
      to <strong>standards supporting reuse models</strong>. This may include automated
      methods that allow linking of UMP models into systems, facilitating system composition
      through naming conventions or other methods, generalization that unifies a collection
      of processes, or standards-based methods for integration with applications.</li>    <li>Advancement
      of <strong>techniques for development and validation of UMP models</strong>.
      This may include demonstration of validation techniques for the effectiveness
      and accuracy of the UMP models or techniques for producing useful derivatives
      of UMP models or creative methods for mining documentary model descriptions
      into formal representations.</li>  </ol>  </li>    <li>Information sources:
      Source of the information used to define the UMP models, such as existing literature,
      industry case studies, and textbooks.</li>    <li>Multiple files may be submitted,
      but should be uploaded as a single file submission (.zip or .pdf.) A template
      formatted to capture entry requirements is provided on the Event Website for
      the submission.</li>  </ol>  <strong>RAMP Challenge Award(s)</strong>    The
      Prize Purse for the RAMP Challenge is a total of $3,250. The Prize Purse may
      increase, but will not decrease. Any increases in the Prize Purse will be posted
      on the Event Website and published in the <u>Federal Register</u>.  The Prize
      Purse will be used to fund one or more awards.    NIST will announce via the
      Event Website any Entry(ies) the finalists and those entries to which the Judges
      have made a cash award (each, an “Award”).  The anticipated number and amount
      of the Awards that will be awarded for this Competition is set forth in this
      <u>Federal Register</u> Notice; however, the Judges are not obligated to make
      all or any Awards, and reserve the right to award fewer than the anticipated
      number of Awards in the event an insufficient number of eligible Entries meet
      any one or more of the Judging Criteria for this Competition, based on the Judges''
      evaluation of the quality of Entries and in their sole discretion.  Awards will
      be made based on the Judges’ evaluation of an Entry’s compliance with the Judging
      Criteria for this Competition.    The designated official representative of
      all finalist entries will be notified in an email from NIST to the e-mail address
      provided in the submission document that they have been selected as a finalist.
      Finalists will be required to respond affirmatively and complete further documentation
      within 5 business days that they meet the eligibility criteria set forth in
      this notice and they (in the case of a team, one designated representative)
      are able to participate in person at the 2017 ASME International Manufacturing
      Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC) June 4-8, 2017, at the University
      of Southern California. Travel supplements to defray costs of travel and conference
      participation will be made available as needed. Return of any notification as
      “undeliverable” will result in disqualification.  If a finalist indicates they
      are unable to participate in the conference or does not respond within 5 business
      days, NIST reserves the right to invite the next highest ranked entrant (who
      is not already a finalist), as determined by the subject matter experts, to
      participate as a finalist.    To win an Award, finalists must give a brief in-person
      presentation to the Judges during the MSEC conference in a special session dedicated
      to the RAMP Challenge.  Winners will be determined by the Judging Panel at the
      MSEC Conference, and further verified by NIST. The winner verification process
      with NIST includes providing the full legal name, tax identification number
      or social security number, routing number and banking account to which the prize
      money can be deposited directly. Return of any notification as “undeliverable”
      will result in disqualification.  After verification of eligibility, Awards
      will be distributed in the form of electronic funds transfer addressed to the
      official representative specified in the winning Entry.  That official representative
      will have sole responsibility for further distribution of any Award among Participants
      in a group Entry or within a company or institution that has submitted an Entry
      through that representative.  Each list of Entries receiving Awards for the
      Competition will be made public according to the timeline outlined on the Event
      Website. Winners are responsible for all taxes and reporting related to any
      Award received as part of the Competition.    All costs incurred in the preparation
      of Competition Entries are to be borne by Participants.    <strong>Evaluation,
      Judging, and Selection of Winner(s)</strong>    <em>Submission Evaluation Criteria
      </em>    This section discusses how Participant submissions will be evaluated.    <em>Entry
      Submission and Review</em>    The requirements for submission of a complete
      Entry are detailed in the section “Entry Process for Participants.”  Each Entry
      will be reviewed by subject matter experts, who will assess how well the Entry
      addressed each of the following evaluation criteria. For each Entry, subject
      matter experts will generate a numerical rating from 0 to 100 based on the five
      (5) equally weighted review criteria listed below.  This rating will be supported
      by a brief narrative (fewer than 500 words) of the technical merits of the submission
      in terms of the review criteria. Subject matter experts will provide their individual
      assessments to the NIST Challenge Manager.  The NIST Challenge Manager will
      identify the top eight submissions (“finalist entries”). The finalist entries
      and the accompanying subject matter expert evaluations, both the rating and
      narrative, will be provided to the Judging Panel for their deliberation.    <em>Review
      Criteria</em>    Subject matter experts will consider five equally weighted
      review criteria when evaluating submissions:  <ol>    <li>Completeness: Submission
      follows the guidelines and includes all necessary components.  All submissions
      must describe the approach taken to validate the work and provide both a graphical
      and formal representation of the UMP information model.  An example will be
      posted on the competition website.</li>    <li>Complexity: Model reflects the
      complexities of the manufacturing process, especially those which influence
      sustainability indicators such as energy and material consumption.</li>    <li>Clarity:
      Model is clear in describing the process and the process-related information.</li>    <li>Accuracy:
      Submission accurately models the process as shown through validation.</li>    <li>Novelty:
      Approach taken develops new techniques to advance model reusability or reliability.</li>  </ol>  <em>Judging
      Criteria</em>    Eight finalist entries will be evaluated by the Judges in advance
      of and during the Finalist Presentations to take place at the 2017 ASME International
      Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference.  NIST reserves the right to
      name fewer than eight finalists.    A panel of three (3) to five (5) judges
      will then be convened to rank the finalist entries and determine the winners.
      Judges will review each of the Entries and any corresponding technical assessments
      provided by subject matter experts. Judges will participate in a session at
      the 2017 ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference
      where the finalists will give a 10-15 minute in-person presentation describing
      their submission and how well it meets the judging criteria. Time permitting,
      this will include a question and answer session after each presentation. Judges
      will deliberate and then rank the finalist entries using the weighted Judging
      Criteria (percentage in parentheses):  <ol>    <li>Complexity: Model reflects
      the complexities of the manufacturing process, especially those which influence
      sustainability indicators such as energy and material consumption. (10%)</li>    <li>Clarity:
      Model is clear in describing the process and the process-related information.
      (10%)</li>    <li>Accuracy: Submission accurately models the process as shown
      through validation. (35%)</li>    <li>Novelty: Approach taken develops new techniques
      to advance model reusability or reliability. (35%)</li>    <li>Presentation:
      Quality and content conveyed in a brief in-person presentation at the 2017 MESC
      Conference. (10%)</li>  </ol>  <em>Awards </em>    First, Second, and Third
      Place Prizes, and up to five runners-up, will be selected by the Judges.  <ul>    <li>First
      Place Prize is $1,000</li>    <li>Second Place Prize is $750</li>    <li>Third
      Place Prize is $500</li>    <li>Runners Up Prize is $200</li>  </ul>  <em>Subject
      Matter Experts and Judging Panel</em>    Subject Matter Experts, to be selected
      by the NIST with assistance from Challenge supporters, will, as a body, represent
      a high degree of experience with manufacturing processes, process modeling,
      and sustainability assessment of manufacturing processes, and a balance of perspectives
      from relevant manufacturing sectors. Subject Matter Experts may consist of NIST
      Federal Employees, NIST Associates, employees of RAMP Challenge supporters,
      or their representatives. Subject Matter Experts will not select winners of
      any awards.    The NIST Director will appoint a panel of highly qualified Judges.
      The Judging Panel will consist of individuals who are experts in the field of
      sustainability of manufacturing processes. Judges will deliberate and rank finalist
      entries according to the Judging Criteria described above. The top (up to eight)
      Entries ranked by the Judges will be selected to receive an Award. Judges may
      not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director,
      or agent of, any entity that is a registered Participant in this Competition
      and may not have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who
      is a registered Participant. In the event of such a conflict, a Judge must recuse
      himself or herself. Should this occur a new Judge may be appointed to the panel.<strong> </strong>    <strong>Intellectual

      any kind (including attorneys’ fees) resulting from or arising out of your participation
      in, association with or submission to the RAMP Challenge (including any claims
      alleging that your Entry infringes, misappropriates or violates any third party’s
      intellectual property rights).  In addition, you agree to waive claims against
      the Federal Government and its related entities, except in the case of willful
      misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue, or
      profits, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising from your participation
      in the RAMP Challenge, whether the injury, death, damage, or loss arises through
      negligence or otherwise.    NIST is not responsible for any miscommunications
      such as technical failures related to computer, telephone, cable, and unavailable
      network or server connections, related technical failures, or other failures
      related to hardware, software or virus, or incomplete or late Entries.  Any
      compromise to the fair and proper conduct of the RAMP Challenge may result in
      the disqualification of an Entry or Participant, termination of the RAMP Challenge,
      or other remedial action, at the sole discretion of NIST.  NIST reserves the
      right in its sole discretion to extend or modify the dates of the RAMP Challenge,
      and to change the terms set forth herein governing any phases taking place after
      the effective date of any such change.  By entering, you agree to the terms
      set forth herein and to all decisions of NIST and/or all of their respective
      agents, which are final and binding in all respects.    NIST is not responsible
      for:  (1) Any incorrect or inaccurate information, whether caused by a Participant,
      printing errors, or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or
      used in the RAMP Challenge; (2) unauthorized human intervention in any part
      of the Entry Process for the RAMP Challenge; (3) technical or human error that
      may occur in the administration of the RAMP Challenge or the processing of Entries;
      or (4) any injury or damage to persons or property that may be caused, directly
      or indirectly, in whole or in part, from a Participant’s participation in the
      RAMP Challenge or receipt or use or misuse of an Award.  If for any reason an
      Entry is confirmed to have been deleted erroneously, lost, or otherwise destroyed
      or corrupted, the Participant’s sole remedy is to submit another Entry in the
      RAMP Challenge.    <strong>Termination and Disqualification</strong>    NIST
      reserves the authority to cancel, suspend, and/or modify the RAMP Challenge,
      or any part of it, if any fraud, technical failures, or any other factor beyond
      NIST’s reasonable control impairs the integrity or proper functioning of the
      RAMP Challenge, as determined by NIST in its sole discretion.    NIST reserves
      the right to disqualify any Participant or Participant team it believes to be
      tampering with the Entry process or the operation of the RAMP Challenge or to
      be acting in violation of any applicable rule or condition.    Any attempt by
      any person to undermine the legitimate operation of the RAMP Challenge may be
      a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made,
      NIST reserves the authority to seek damages from any such person to the fullest
      extent permitted by law.    <strong>Verification of Potential Winner(s)</strong>    All
      potential winners are subject to verification by NIST, whose decisions are final
      and binding in all matters related to the RAMP Challenge.    Potential winner(s)
      must continue to comply with all terms and conditions of the RAMP Challenge
      Rules described in this notice, and winning is contingent upon fulfilling all
      requirements.  In the event that a potential winner, or an announced winner,
      is found to be ineligible or is disqualified for any reason, NIST may make an
      award, instead, to another Participant.    <strong>Privacy and Disclosure under
      FOIA</strong>    Except as provided herein, information submitted throughout
      the RAMP Challenge will be used only to communicate with Participants regarding
      Entries and/or the RAMP Challenge.  Participant Entries and submissions to the

  2018 is coming</span></strong>: <a href="https://www.nist.gov">NIST</a> is planning
  for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Annual RAMP competition.  Finalists of the competition will
  present at the <a href="http://energy.tamu.edu/events/2018-asme-international-manufacturing-science-engineering-conference/">International
  Manufacturing Science &amp; Engineering Conference (MSEC)</a> and the <a href="http://www.sme.org/namrc/">46th
  North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC)</a>. The co-located conferences
  will be hosted by <a href="https://www.tamu.edu">Texas A&amp;M University</a> from
  June 18-22, 2018, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Station,_Texas">College
  Station, Texas, USA</a>.    The upcoming competition will again build on ASTM standards
  for modeling manufacturing processes of the entrants choosing.  The emphasis for
  the 2018 competition will be use process models to track resources and flows through
  the manufacturing system.    We encourage student projects to consider using the
  competition as a focus for their work.    Description below corresponds to the 2017
  competition and is likely to change a bit. More details of the 2018 competition
  rules and entry process will come soon.    <hr />  <p style="text-align: left;">In
  the future, manufacturing will be planned out in the virtual world. How can we do
  this if we don''t even have models for the basic processes such as welding, drilling,
  and forging? Sewing, assembly, or distillation? Nope, we don''t even have models
  for those either! At least, not the types of models really needed for our high-tech
  world.</p>  <p style="text-align: left;">Manufacturers need models to improve operations,
  to protect the environment, to share information, and to compose them into systems.
  Using your models will let manufacturers simulate, improve, and optimize all sorts
  of processes.</p>  Help us try out brand new standards created just for this purpose.
  Be the first to model your favorite processes, share your experiences, and maybe
  win some cash and honors!    <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ramp-reusable-abstractions-of-manufacturing-processes/simple-alarm-clock-3/"

  can be hilariously complex but simple is good too. We''re truly at the starting

  Aspects of Manufacturing Processes (ASTM E60.13 E3012-16). In addition, your entry
  will more likely win over our enthusiastic judges by using other standards as appropriate
