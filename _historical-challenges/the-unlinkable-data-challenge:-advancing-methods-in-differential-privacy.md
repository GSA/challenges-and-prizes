description: '<h2><em>Submissions are in...Stage 1 is closed!  </em></h2>  <h2><em>Check
  back for winner information Sept 12th</em></h2>  <h2>Challenge Overview</h2>  JOIN
  US for this exciting challenge... designed to advance data privacy and public safety
  data!  This challenge is focused on proactively protecting individual privacy while
  allowing for data to be used by researchers for positive purposes and outcomes.  It
  is well known that privacy in data release is an important area for the Federal
  Government (which has an Open Data Policy), state governments, the public safety
  sector and many commercial non-governmental organizations.  Developments coming
  out of this competition would drive major advances in the practical applications
  of differential privacy for these organizations.    The purpose of this series of
  competitions is to provide a platform for researchers to develop more advanced differentially
  private methods that can substantially improve the privacy protection and utility
  of the resulting datasets.  <h2>Background</h2>  Databases across the country include
  information with potentially important research implications and uses, e.g. contingency
  planning in disaster scenarios, identifying safety risks in aviation, assist in
  tracking contagious diseases, identifying patterns of violence in local communities.
   However, included in these datasets are personally identifiable information (PII)
  and it is not enough to simply remove PII from these datasets.  It is well known
  that using auxiliary and possibly completely unrelated datasets, in combination
  with records in the dataset, can correspond to uniquely identifiable individuals
  (known as a linkage attack).  Today''s efforts to remove PII do not provide adequate
  protection against linkage attacks. With the advent of “big data” and technological
  advances in linking data, there are far too many other possible data sources related
  to each of us that can lead to our identity being uncovered.  <h2>Get Involved -
  How to Participate</h2>  The Unlinkable Data Challenge is a multi-stage Challenge. 
  This first stage of the Challenge is intended to source detailed concepts for new
  approaches, inform the final design in the two subsequent stages, and provide recommendations
  for matching stage 1 competitors into teams for subsequent stages.  Teams will predict
  and justify where their algorithm fails with respect to the utility-privacy frontier
  curve.    In this stage, competitors are asked to propose how to de-identify a dataset
  using less than the available privacy budget, while also maintaining the dataset’s
  utility for analysis.  For example, the de-identified data, when put through the
  same analysis pipeline as the original dataset, produces comparable results (i.e.
  similar coefficients in a linear regression model, or a classifier that produces
  similar predictions on sub-samples of the data).    This stage of the Challenge
  seeks <u>Conceptual</u> Solutions that describe how to use and/or combine methods
  in differential privacy to mitigate privacy loss when publicly releasing datasets
  in a variety of industries such as public safety, law enforcement, healthcare/biomedical
  research, education, and finance.  We are limiting the scope to addressing research
  questions and methodologies that require regression, classification, and clustering
  analysis on datasets that contain numerical, geo-spatial, and categorical data.    To
  compete in this stage, we are asking that you propose a new algorithm utilizing
  existing or new randomized mechanisms with a justification of how this will optimize
  privacy and utility across different analysis types.  We are also asking you to
  propose a dataset that you believe would make a good use case for your proposed
  algorithm, and provide a means of comparing your algorithm and other algorithms.    <strong>All
  submissions must be made using the submission form provided on <a href="https://www.herox.com/UnlinkableDataChallenge">HeroX
  website</a>.  Submissions will be judged using the listed criteria and scoring scheme. Challenge
  Sponsor has the right to make updates and/or make any changes at any time during
  the Challenge. (see official rules)</strong>    Teams that participate in the HeroX
  challenge, as well as newly formed teams that did not participate, can proceed to
  a leader-board-driven competition on Topcoder, the Algorithm Competition #1.  It
  is anticipated that Competition #1 will be followed by iterating improvements in
  the Algorithm Sprint, and finish with a final penultimate Challenge to further boost
  performance in the Algorithm Competition #2.  Where a competitor''s algorithm falls
  with respect to the utility-privacy frontier curve will determine who wins subsequent
  Topcoder Competitions.  The final review and decision of the judge will be announced
  in accordance of the rules on this site.  <h2>Schedule for Stage 1</h2>  Pre-registration
