    rules: 'Official Rules, Terms and Conditions    <strong>Background</strong>    The
      2016 FDA Naloxone App Competition (the competition), announced on Sept. 20,
      2016 in the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/20/2016-22550/announcement-of-requirements-and-registration-for-the-2016-food-and-drug-administration-naloxone-app">Federal
      Register</a>, encourages computer programmers, public health advocates, clinical
      researchers, entrepreneurs, and innovators from all disciplines to create teams
      focused on the development of innovative strategies to combat the rising epidemic
      of opioid overdose.  Specifically, the competition invites submissions for an
      app that increases the likelihood of timely naloxone administration by connecting
      opioid users experiencing an overdose with nearby naloxone carriers. FDA is
      most interested in concepts that are readily scalable, free or low-cost to the
      end-user, and take advantage of existing systems for naloxone distribution and
      use. FDA’s expectation is that any app developed through the competition will
      be used only with FDA-approved naloxone products.    As explained in the Federal
      Register Notice, announcing the competition, FDA is sponsoring the competition
      under section 105 of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (Pub.
      L. 111-258). FDA will be provided with technical expertise by the National Institute
      on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
      (SAMHSA). NIDA and SAMHSA will each provide one (1) judge with experience in
      relevant fields including drug use and misuse, clinical trial design, development
      of mobile medical applications, and public health. Additionally, NIDA and SAMHSA
      will provide information to competition entrants at the code-a-thon on key issues,
      including (1) patterns of opioid use and misuse, (2) characteristics of populations
      at risk of opioid overdose, and (3) data collection and evaluation considerations.    The
      Federal Register Notice stated, “To be eligible to win a prize under this Challenge,
      an entrant (individual or entity): Shall have registered and entered a submission
      on <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">http://www.Challenge.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">http://www.YouTube.com</a>
      under the rules promulgated by FDA.” Additionally, the notice points entrants
      to these rules for additional details on required components of a submission,
      and the minimum requirements for the proposed app. Accordingly, this document
      sets forth the official rules, terms and conditions (rules) that apply to the
      2016 FDA Naloxone App Competition. These rules and should be read carefully
      before submitting a proposal.    <strong>Overview</strong>    Registration for
      the competition will open Sept. 23, 2016 and will close Oct. 7, 2016. To register,
      visit <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">http://www.Challenge.gov</a>, search
      for the 2016 FDA Naloxone App Competition, and follow the instructions.  FDA
      strongly encourages entrants to register as teams, though individual registrations
      will be accepted. Throughout the competition, all interested parties will have
      online access to background information regarding the opioid epidemic and the
      public health recommendations for the safe and appropriate use of naloxone.    The
      competition will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will consist of a code-a-thon
      at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) campus in Silver Spring, Maryland,
      for registered entrants to develop concepts and initial prototypes for an app
      that alerts carriers of naloxone to a nearby opioid overdose. Entrants are encouraged,
      but not required, to participate in the code-a-thon. Entrants will receive an
      email confirming registration and participation in the code-a-thon, if applicable.
      The code-a-thon will occur on Oct. 19-20, 2016.  The code-a-thon event space
      is limited to the first 50 individuals who indicate interest in on-site participation
      during the registration process. There will be a virtual component to the code-a-thon
      for the first 100 individuals who indicate interest in remote participation
      during the registration process. At the code-a-thon, federal agency subject
      matter experts will provide background information to entrants on topics including,
      but not limited to the opioid epidemic, public health, and mobile medical applications
      and medical device development. All code developed through the code-a-thon will
      be made open-source and publicly accessible on the GitHub platform, a web-based
      code repository.    In Phase 2, all registered entrants will independently refine
      their concepts into a functional prototype, a video of which will be uploaded
      to YouTube (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/">http://www.YouTube.com</a>). The
      video URL will be submitted, accompanied by a short summary/description of the
      prototype as detailed below, on <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">http://www.Challenge.gov</a>
      by the submission deadline of Nov. 7, 2016.  Entrants will be permitted to submit
      questions before and during the code-a-thon to FDA, NIDA, and SAMHSA subject
      matter experts with backgrounds in opioids, drug use, public health, and mobile
      medical devices.  All entrants will have access to submitted questions and their
      answers, which will be publicly posted online.  Submissions will be evaluated
      by a panel of judges appointed by FDA based on the criteria set forth in these
      rules.    The winning submission will be awarded a prize of $40,000. The prize
      awarded under this competition will be paid by electronic funds transfer and
      may be subject to federal income taxes. FDA will comply with the Internal Revenue
      Service withholding and reporting requirements, where applicable.  The total
      prize pool for the FDA Naloxone App Competition will be $40,000.  FDA reserves
      the right to not award a prize if no submission is deemed worthy.  FDA also
      reserves the right to suspend, postpone, terminate, cancel, or otherwise modify
      the competition, or any entrant’s participation in the competition, at any time
      at the discretion of the agency.    During all phases of app development, all
      entrants should consider strategies to minimize legal risk and maximize regulatory
      compliance, including for the developer and the end-user. To ensure adequate
      consideration of potential liability, privacy and regulatory concerns, FDA strongly
      encourages all entrants to obtain independent legal counsel.    Entrants may
      not test or evaluate their app using real people, including opioid users and
      naloxone carriers, during the competition. Following the competition, entrants
      may consider seeking grant funding from the NIDA Small Business Innovation Research
      (SBIR) program, to further develop competition concepts through testing and
      evaluation.  As with all other National Institutes of Health funding applications,
      NIDA staff will provide dedicated assistance and guidance about the NIH grant
      submission process, including submissions for the NIDA SBIR grants. The SBIR
      grant program is open to all small businesses (which may include competition
      entrants) that meet applicable eligibility requirements set forth in the SBIR
      funding opportunity announcement. More information is available at <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-16-302.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-16-302.html</a>.
      For competition entrants and projects that meet all applicable SBIR requirements,
      the NIDA SBIR program may provide the opportunity to further develop Competition
      concepts through field testing and evaluation.    <strong>Eligibility</strong>    As
      stated in the Federal Register Notice, to be eligible to win a prize under this
      competition, an individual or entity:  <ol>    <li>Must have completed and submitted

      or as part of a team. Teams are strongly encouraged, and may be assembled from
      previously established firms or entities. Proposals may involve pre-existing
      technology or applications that an individual or team wish to redesign for the
      purposes of this competition. Individuals and/or team members must be clearly
      identified on the submission form in order to be eligible for the competition.
      Teams must designate a single individual as the primary contact and who will
      be authorized to bind the team or entity (“Lead”). The lead will be wholly responsible
      for the management and use of any prize monies awarded. In the event a dispute
      regarding the identity of the individual or team submitting the entry cannot
      be resolved to the satisfaction of FDA, the affected entry will be deemed ineligible.    All
      entry information and materials, including any copy of the submission, will
      be retained by FDA and will not be returned. Proof of submission is not considered
      proof of delivery to or receipt of such entry. Furthermore, FDA shall have no
      liability for any submission that is lost, intercepted, or not received by FDA.
      FDA further assumes no liability or responsibility for any error, omission,
      interruption, deletion, theft, destruction or unauthorized access to, or alteration
      of, submissions.    Minimum requirements for the proposed app are:  <ul>    <li>Use
      of crowd-sourcing technology to identify one or more individuals in close proximity
      to the overdose who could administer naloxone;</li>    <li>Minimize the time
      required to identify one or more individuals in close proximity to the overdose
      that could deliver naloxone to an individual experiencing an opioid overdose;
      and</li>    <li>Compatibility with multiple platforms, including Android and
      iOS.</li>  </ul>  All written, digital, or recorded materials must be in English.
      Submissions are required to include a video of the functional app prototype
      and a supporting summary document.  The video must be uploaded to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">http://www.YouTube.com</a>
      and be no more than five (5) minutes in duration. The video must demonstrate
      a functional prototype of the application, including any planned interfaces
      between the app and existing systems or datasets. The summary document must
      be submitted on http://www.Challenge.gov and not exceed three (3) pages. The
      summary document is required to include:  <ol>    <li>A description of the entrant(s),
      including relevant fields of expertise;</li>    <li>A summary of the concept
      for the app, including identification of the target audience;</li>    <li>A
      general description of the proposed technical design, including an explanation
      of any planned interfaces between the app and existing systems or datasets;
      and</li>    <li>The URL for the uploaded YouTube video.</li>  </ol>  <strong>Data
      Security Policy</strong>    Drug use and abuse are sensitive topics that require
      careful consideration of privacy and confidentiality issues. The submissions
      must not contain any data about real people, and entrants may not use data from
      or about actual people in development of the app.    <strong>Regulatory Policy</strong>    A
      mobile medical application intended to facilitate treatment of opioid overdose
      is considered to be a device under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug,
      and Cosmetic Act.  The winning app developed through this Competition, therefore,
      would be a device under FDA’s jurisdiction. However, as described in the 2015
      FDA Guidance for Industry on Mobile Medical Applications (available at: <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/.../UCM263366.pdf">http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/.../UCM263366.pdf</a>),
      FDA does not intend to enforce regulatory requirements under the Federal Food,
      Drug and Cosmetic Act for certain mobile medical apps.    <strong>Representations
      and Warranties/Indemnification</strong>    By participating in the competition,
      each entrant represents, warrants, and covenants as follows:  <ol>    <li>The
      entrant – whether an individual, team or entity – is the sole author, creator,
      and owner of the submission;</li>    <li>The submission is not the subject of
      any actual or threatened litigation or claim;</li>    <li>The submission does
      not and will not violate or infringe upon the intellectual property rights,
      privacy rights, publicity rights, or other legal rights of any third party;</li>    <li>The
      submission does not and will not contain any harmful computer code (sometimes
      referred to as “malware,” “viruses” or “worms”); and</li>    <li>The Submission,
      and entrants’ use of the Submission, does not and will not violate any applicable
      laws or regulations, including, without limitation, applicable export control
      laws and regulations of the U.S. and other jurisdictions.</li>  </ol>  If the
      Submission includes any third party works (such as third party content or open
      source code), entrant must be able to provide, upon the request of FDA, documentation
      of all appropriate licenses and releases for such third party works. If entrant
      cannot provide documentation of all required licenses and releases, FDA reserves
      the right to disqualify the applicable Submission, or seek to secure the licenses
      and releases for the benefit of FDA, and allow the applicable Submission to
      remain in the Competition. FDA also reserves all rights with respect to claims
      based on any damages caused by participant’s failure to obtain such licenses
      and releases.    Entrants – whether an individual, a team or an entity - will
      indemnify, defend, and hold harmless FDA, NIDA and SAMHSA, from and against
      all third party claims, actions, or proceedings of any kind and from any and
      all damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses relating to or arising from entrant’s
      Submission or any breach or alleged breach of any of the representations, warranties,
      and covenants of entrant hereunder.    FDA reserves the right to disqualify
      any Submission that FDA, in its discretion, deems to violate these Rules.    <strong>Intellectual
      Property and Copyright License</strong> <strong> </strong>    To receive the
      prize, entrants will not be required to transfer their intellectual property
      rights to FDA. Each entrant retains any applicable intellectual property rights
      not expressly granted under this Agreement. By participating in the Competition,
      each entrant hereby irrevocably grants to FDA, and any third-parties acting
      on FDA’s behalf an irrevocable, paid up, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide

      and biographical information in any and all media for advertising and promotional
      purposes relating to the Competition, as stated in these Rules.    <strong>Disqualification</strong>    FDA
      reserves the right to disqualify any entrant who is found to be tampering with
      the entry process or the operation of the Competition or Competition website
      or other Competition-related websites, to be acting in violation of these Rules,
      or to be acting in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner, or with the intent
      to disrupt or undermine the legitimate operation of the Competition, or to annoy,
      abuse, threaten, or harass any other person. FDA reserves the right to seek
      damages and other remedies from any such person to the fullest extent permitted
      by law.    <strong>Selection Criteria</strong>    A panel of judges with experience
      in the fields of mobile medical application development, public health, and/or
      regulatory science chosen by FDA will select the highest-performing entrant

      an individual community (weight 25 percent).</li>  </ul>  The evaluation criteria
      are to be applied in the sole discretion of the individual judges and are subject
      to modification by FDA. By participating in the competition, each entrant into
      the Competition agrees to be bound by and not challenge the final decisions
      of FDA and the judges.    When notification of the winner is completed, or as
      soon as is practical thereafter, the videos of the highest performing submissions
      will be posted on the competition website for public viewing. The judging scores
      will not be posted.    Attempts to notify the winning entrant will be made using
      the contact information provided on the competition registration form. FDA is
      not responsible for e-mail or other communication problems of any kind. If,
      despite reasonable efforts, an entrant does not respond within three (3) days
      of the first notification attempt regarding selection as winner of the Competition,
      or if the notification is returned as undeliverable to such entrant, that entrant
      may forfeit his, her or its status and an alternate winner may be selected,
      or the applicable prize may go unawarded.    If any potential prize winner is
      found to be ineligible, or has not complied with these rules, or declines the
      applicable prize for any reason prior to award, such potential prize winner
      will be disqualified and an alternate winner may be selected, or the applicable
      prize may go unawarded.    <strong>General Liability Release</strong>    By
      participating in the competition, each entrant hereby agrees that:  <ol>    <li>FDA

  - winner-solution-description-0: 'OD Help’s concept is a simple, easy-to-use mobile
      app designed to connect potential opioid overdose victims with a crowd-sourced
      network of naloxone carriers. OD Help can easily be tailored for use in rural
      or urban areas by expanding or contracting the radius within which naloxone
      carriers are sought. An additional innovative feature of OD Help is the optional
      interface with a breathing monitor to detect when a victim’s breathing rate
      is dangerously low, a sign of an opioid overdose. Hence, if the victim is alone
      and unable to call for help, OD Help will detect the diminished breathing and
      alert a naloxone carrier of the potential overdose. Other features of OD Help
      include: only alerting people in one’s support network and allowing naloxone
      carriers to disable alerts when they are unable to respond. The app also provides
      instructions on how to correctly diagnose an overdose and administer naloxone
      and helps contact emergency medical services when help is required.'

description: "<p>In 2014, nearly two million Americans aged 12 or older either abused
  or were dependent on opioid painkillers, and&nbsp;61% of drug overdose deaths involved
  either an opioid painkiller or heroin.&nbsp; Naloxone is an antidote for an opioid
  overdose, whether from prescription opioids or heroin.&nbsp; It is a prescription
  drug with few side effects that rapidly reverses the effects of opioid overdoses.&nbsp;
  Although most frequently used in emergency&nbsp;rooms and on ambulances,&nbsp;many
  states have recently&nbsp;taken steps to make it easier for&nbsp;people in the general
  public, including family and friends of drug users, to carry and administer naloxone.</p>\r\n<p>Despite&nbsp;the
  increasing availability of naloxone,&nbsp;people carrying naloxone&nbsp;are often&nbsp;unaware
  when&nbsp;an overdose occurs nearby.&nbsp; Currently, there are no mechanisms to
  alert carriers of naloxone to a person in need of the&nbsp;medication.&nbsp; This
  is where you come in!</p>\r\n<p>FDA is hosting the <strong>2016 FDA Naloxone App
  Competition</strong> to encourage computer scientists, public health advocates,
  clinical researchers and entrepreneurs to develop creative solutions to this problem.
  &nbsp;Specifically, we are looking for innovative ideas for a smartphone app that
  connects people experiencing an opioid overdose to nearby carriers of naloxone.&nbsp;
  We are most interested in concepts that are readily scalable, free or low-cost to
  the end-user, and take advantage of existing systems for naloxone distribution and
  use.</p>\r\n<p>How does the Competition work?</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You register.&nbsp;See
  more information about registration below.</li>\r\n<li>You decide whether and how
  you want to participate in one of our first-ever FDA code-a-thons on Oct. 19-20,
  2016! There are options for in-person and virtual participation - learn more in
  the Rules section.</li>\r\n<li>You refine your concept after the code-a-thon, and
  then send in your submission - more details about that below.</li>\r\n<li>The submissions
  are judged, and the entrant with the highest score wins $40,000!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Want
  to learn more about opioids and naloxone?</strong> We've pulled together lots of
