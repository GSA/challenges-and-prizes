  CRASHES &amp; $350,000 TO MAKE IT A REALITY</strong></h2>  &nbsp;  <h3><strong>SUMMARY</strong></h3>  The
  U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) is launching the Solving for Safety Visualization
  Challenge to incentivize the use of safety data in the development of innovative
  analytical visualization tools that will reveal insights into serious crashes and
  improve understanding of transportation safety. The Challenge serves as a platform
  to capture the imaginations of technology and data firms, transportation stakeholders,
  and state and local agencies to unlock their creativity, and empower them to develop
  innovative new data visualization tools that can help improve road and rail user
  safety, to benefit all transportation users.    The Challenge is open to individuals
  and teams (Solvers) from the business and research communities, including technology
  companies, analytics firms, transportation carriers, industry associations, research
  institutions, universities, mapping and visualization providers. Solvers will compete
  for cash prizes that will be awarded throughout the multi-stage Challenge. The Challenge
  prize purse is $350,000, with four semi-finalists competing for a portion of the
  $100,000 interim prize and two final-stage Solvers competing for a portion of the
  $250,000 final prize.    The Challenge will begin on June 14, 2018. After the launch,
  USDOT will accept Stage I submissions up to 11:59 pm EDT on July 31, 2018. A panel
  of judges will review team submissions and announce Stage I finalists in August
  2018.    &nbsp;    <strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</strong>  <ul>    <li><a href="{{

  2017, motor vehicle traffic crashes resulted in an estimated <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812542"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">37,150 fatalities</a>. Comprehensively, crashes are
  a societal harm that cost the Nation <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812451"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">over $800 billion annually</a> in lives lost or injured,
  as well as lost work productivity and property damage. When the cost of serious
  crashes is put into context, the weight of this issue becomes much more grave and
  the need for an innovative, non-traditional approach becomes apparent. Safety is
  USDOT’s number one priority, and we are committed to reducing the incidence of serious
  and fatal injuries on our roadways.<a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a>    The
  USDOT’s transportation safety programs have decades of research and design behind
  them and have proven effective in reducing injuries and fatalities by 40% between
  1990 and 2011.  In recent years, these advances have leveled off, and new insights
  and strategies are required to make further advances.    Traditional factors do
  not fully explain the causes of the recent significant increase in traffic fatalities.
  Increases in driving are one factor; however, the rate of fatalities per 100 million
  vehicle miles traveled (VMT) also increased from 1.08 fatalities per 100 million
  VMT in 2014 to an <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812542"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated 1.17 in 2017</a>. Economic conditions,
  gasoline prices, weather and other factors are also correlated with increased traffic
  fatalities.    USDOT seeks to reverse the current trend, rapidly detect changes
  that indicate unsafe conditions, and reduce transportation-related fatalities and
  serious injuries across the transportation system.  The Department is pursuing data-informed
  decision-making to help strategically prioritize and address transportation safety
  risks.  One pillar of this approach is data visualization.  USDOT seeks clear, compelling
  data visualization tools that make data analysis and insights accessible to policy-makers,
  transportation providers and the public who make safety choices every day.    <hr
  />    <h3><strong>CHALLENGE</strong></h3>  Currently transportation decision makers
  have a limited number of analytical visualization tools available that reveal insights,
  and even fewer focused on safety and prevention of serious crashes.  A new opportunity
  lies in the rapid growth and advancement in technology and analytics markets combined
  with the volume and variety of transportation and other data now collected by the
  public and private sectors.    For this reason, Solving for Safety Visualization
  Challenge is looking for the best innovators from the business and research communities,
  including technology companies, analytics firms, transportation carriers, industry
  associations, research institutions, universities, mapping and visualization providers,
  to tackle this challenge.  Analytical visualization tools can cast new light on
  the data to reveal insights not seen though tabular analysis. The Challenge has
  been created to advance the use of safety data visualizations for answering analytical
  questions related to surface transportation system safety.    In this challenge,
  Solvers will compete for cash prizes by developing innovative analytical visualization
  tools to gain insights into fatalities and serious injuries on the U.S. road and
  rail systems that policymakers, providers, and operators can use to inform the development
  of safety solutions.    &nbsp;    <strong>Challenge Solvers will choose to develop
  one of two types of analytical visualization tools:</strong>  <ul>    <li><strong>Discover
  Insights Tools</strong> which analyze data to reveal patterns and trends, and use
  compelling visualizations to explain what is happening, understand the meaning behind
  the data, and draw conclusions. These tools often combine disparate data sets and
  allow a user to ask a question and search for answers visually.</li>    <li><strong>Simulation
  Tools</strong> which assist in decision-making by visualizing data, mathematical,
  and statistical models to identify issues, determine correlations, and assign probabilities
  with a degree of accuracy.  Developed using existing models and data, including
  those provided by USDOT and Innovation Agents, this type of tool will allow users
  to visualize the outputs of model simulations and scenarios, highlighting the different
  conditions and the results of sensitivity and parametric analysis to visually assist
  in decision-making.</li>  </ul>  USDOT is looking for Solvers to bring novel concepts
  and perspectives to existing models and data to develop analytical visualization
  tools that provide life-saving insights and solutions for transportation safety. 
  Solvers should use innovation and creativity to further define the tools.   Tools
  can range from dashboards using disparate data sets, to spatial analysis via maps,
  virtual or augmented reality scenarios, image and image analysis, social media mining
  and beyond. The tools can be powered by models and data provided by USDOT, Challenge
  Innovation Agents and/or resources to which Solvers have access to through their
  organizations, partners, and other sources. See <a href="http://www.transportation.gov/solve4safety"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.transportation.gov/solve4safety</a> for a sample
  list of datasets and tools.    &nbsp;    <strong>Challenge Solvers will develop
  analytical visualization tools to complement existing USDOT projects while addressing
  one or more of the following safety focus areas:</strong>  <ol>    <li><strong>Vulnerable
  System Users</strong> – these include non-motorized road users, such as pedestrians
  and cyclists, as well as motorcyclists and persons with disabilities or reduced
  mobility and orientation, such as those with declining vision and hearing.  Ongoing
  work at USDOT has identified those who are more at risk on the road system, but
  beyond the police reports and behavior research, pieces of the story that can improve
  how we protect these users are still missing. Example questions Solvers might address:  <ul>    <li>Between
  2013 and 2016 there was a <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812246"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">25-percent increase</a> in pedestrians killed in
  traffic crashes. A disproportionate share of these pedestrian fatalities involved
  males, occurred in urban locations, and took place after dark. How can data visualization
  tools support decision-makers in learning from the relationships among various contributory
  crash risk factors that are specific to their communities?</li>    <li>A Crash Modification
  Factor (CMF) is a multiplicative factor that indicates the proportion of crashes
  that would be expected after implementing a countermeasure. Examples of countermeasures
  include installing a traffic signal, increasing the width of road edge lines, and
  installing a median barrier.  We have proven that different countermeasures work,
  and we know the CMFs for each countermeasure, but how could we help decision makers
  choose among appropriate countermeasures?</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ol>  <ol start="2">    <li><strong>Conflict
  Points Impacts</strong> – these are locations where user paths intersect, including
  road intersections and rail grade crossings. Conflict points are categorized as
  crossing, merging (or joining) and diverging (or separating). We’re investigating
  which conflict points correlate most with motor vehicle crashes, but we don’t fully
  understand the difference between near-misses and impacts at these points. Example
  questions Solvers might address:  <ul>    <li>Much of the nation is built around
  the railroad system. By developing around this infrastructure, we have unintentionally
  created conflict points that users are drawn to, often putting communities at greatest
  risk. How can data visualization tools better support urban planners identifying
  which grade crossings are more prone to accidents and the best risk reduction strategies
  to employ?</li>    <li>In the United States, over the last several years an <a href="https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/intersection/"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">average of one-quarter</a> of traffic fatalities
  and roughly half of all traffic injuries are attributed to intersections. Strategies
  to address roadway intersection safety are diverse: they are often engineering-based,
  including geometric design and application of traffic control devices (such as signs,
  markings and signals) and with a foundation in human factors. Quite often, it is
  a combination of these strategies that is needed to truly solve a problem. How can
  we visually compare the safety impacts of traditional signals, roundabouts, and
  protected left turns?</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ol>  <ol start="3">    <li><strong>High
  Risk Factors</strong> – these include young drivers, impaired drivers, drowsy drivers,
  older drivers, and speeding drivers. We’ve identified high risk factors, but we
  don’t have complete insights on the role of spatial and temporal exposures. Example
  questions Solvers might address:  <ul>    <li>There is a misalignment between human
  behavior and judgment, and roadway and vehicle design. New, young drivers have a
  higher crash risk than any other age group. How can data visualization tools support
  and educate people to improve their driving behaviors?</li>    <li>In 2015, alcohol-impaired
  driving fatalities accounted for 29 percent of the total motor vehicle traffic fatalities.
  How can data visualization tools support first responders’ on-site interventions?</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ol>  &nbsp;    <strong>Challenge
  Solvers will also focus their analytical visualization tools by designing them for
  use by one of the following audiences:</strong>  <ul>    <li><strong>Policy makers
  and influencers</strong> –these are people in Federal, State, and local government
  agencies, associations, and industry bodies.  They attempt to reduce transportation-related
  fatalities and serious injuries by analyzing safety data to identify safety risks
  and recommending a series of strategies, incentives or disincentives using personnel,
  funding, or laws and regulations to address them.</li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li><strong>Providers/Operators</strong>
  – these are people in business and government who build and operate the transportation
  system.  These include vehicle and equipment manufacturers, trucking and rail companies,
  state and local departments of transportation, law enforcement, and emergency services.
  They attempt to influence the reduction of transportation-related fatalities and
  serious injuries by analyzing safety data and designing equipment and facilities,
  performing system diagnostics, evaluating safety effectiveness, and developing operations,
  countermeasures and techniques to reduce fatalities and serious injuries for users
  of the transportation system.</li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li><strong>Public</strong> –
  these are people who use the transportation system or live in the United States. 
  These include motor vehicle drivers, motor vehicle passengers, bicyclists and pedestrians. 
  They have an interest in protecting themselves and others in the community who use
  the transportation system.</li>  </ul>  &nbsp;    All ideas will compete against
  the full pool of entries regardless of the type of tool, safety focus area or audience
  being proposed.    The Challenge invites creative minds from across the Nation to
  reveal these missing links.  The business and research communities have the unique
  set of skills and creativity to step up and revolutionize transportation safety.
  The transportation safety community has welcomed innovation, but will benefit further
  from the perspective and skills of other subject areas. To foster new, novel, and
  innovative analytical visualization tools, USDOT is looking for Solvers and data
  from a variety of sectors. The USDOT encourages the participation of Solvers from
  outside the traditional transportation safety arena who will bring innovative methods,
  procedures, techniques, and strategies when developing solutions.  The USDOT also
  has an interest in stimulating the integration of new or private sector data sources
  into the Solvers’ analytical visualization tools.    <hr />    <h3><strong>CHALLENGE
  INNOVATION AGENTS</strong></h3>  Challenge Innovation Agents are companies and organizations
  interested in providing real-world knowledge, guidance, insight, issues, and data
  to Solvers, especially those new to the transportation safety space.  USDOT will
  provide a public listing of all organizations and companies who identify as Challenge
  Innovation Agents.  This listing will provide a brief description and contact information
  for each Innovation Agent to assist Solvers that are interested in talking to or
  partnering with Innovation Agents for the Challenge.  USDOT will list two types
  of Challenge Innovation Agents: Technical Assistance and Data.  <ul>    <li><strong>Technical
  Assistance (T.A.) Innovation Agents</strong> can provide interested Solvers with
  knowledge, guidance, insight and issues related to transportation safety.  T.A.
  Innovation Agents may be able to provide technical assistance related to key safety
  issues impacting their members or employees, transportation safety techniques, transportation
  system characteristics, users and operations, approaches from other industries and
  sectors.</li>    <li><strong>Data Innovation Agents</strong> can provide interested
  Solvers with access to data or analytic techniques that can be used in the analytical
  visualization tools. Use of a wide variety of disparate data is encouraged to gain
  insights into reducing fatalities and serious injuries on the U.S. road and rail
  systems.</li>  </ul>  Challenge Innovation Agents will have the opportunity to explain
  their expertise and capacity to interested Solvers who will be designing tools that
  can prove useful in furthering the Innovation Agents or other user’s efforts to
  reduce fatalities and serious injuries.  Innovation Agents providing data access
  will benefit from national recognition and highlight of their data asset, and the
  exploration and testing of their data by Solvers for use by the transportation safety
  community.    Solvers are encouraged to seek support from Innovation Agents to strengthen
  their individual/team expertise. Innovation Agents may register their support throughout
  the Challenge by signing up at <a href="http://www.transportation.gov/solve4safety"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.transportation.gov/solve4safety</a>. A list of
  current Innovation Agents will be updated on the official Challenge website. The
  Challenge will host a webinar to facilitate Solver-Innovation Agent relationship
  building.    <hr />    <strong> Technology has already changed how most of us get
  around. Let’s leverage it to change how we view transportation safety.</strong>    The
  USDOT Solving for Safety Visualization Challenge can act as an engine in driving
  serious crash reduction. By incentivizing innovation, USDOT will attract the best
  Solvers from around the nation to come up with new tools for visualizing the risks
  of serious crashes. As with other government competitions, the USDOT Solving for
  Safety Visualization Challenge aims to create a vibrant community of thinkers and
  doers who drive revolutionary innovation.    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    <a href="#_ftnref1"
