  The Army is conducting a change of mission to focus on combating the COVID-19
  pandemic. With this new mission, the Army will protect the force, posture the
  force to maintain global operational readiness, and support the national
  effort to fight against COVID-19. The Army continually assesses how we will
  best protect Soldiers, Civilians and their families, maintain force readiness
  to meet global challenges, and provide support to the FEMA-lead national
  COVID-19 response.


  Accordingly, effective immediately, the Army Acquisition Executive is launching the xTech: COVID-19 Ventilator Challenge to all innovators across the nation. The Army solicits the innovation community's ideas for combatting this unprecedented modern pandemic. The prize competition will evaluate technology proposals immediately upon submission and award novel solutions with a prize of $5,000 to present a virtual pitch of the technology concept to the xTech COVID-19 panel, and award prizes of $100,000 to solutions accepted by the panel to develop a concept prototype.  Select technologies may receive follow on contracts for additional production and deployment.  The efforts described in this Notice are being pursued under the authorities of 10 USC 2374a.

  Prizes will be offered under 10 USC §2374a (Prize competitions). The total
  prize pool is $1,000,000.00. 


  * Application Part 1: White Paper - $5,000

  * Application Part 2: Technology Pitches - $100,000


  Number of winners is to-be determined, with total prizes not to exceed $1,000,000.00.


  In addition, detailed feedback will be provided to all participants at the end of each phase. The purpose of providing this feedback is to help accelerate transition of the technology by providing suggestions for product improvement, and recommended next steps for development.
rules: >-
  The Ventilator Challenge is voluntary and open to all US-based entities.
  Registration information and upload submission will be accepted beginning 5
  April 2020 and will be reviewed upon receipt. Submissions that are approved by
