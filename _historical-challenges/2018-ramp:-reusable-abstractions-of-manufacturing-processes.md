      a detailed explanation of each element and attribute in the schema.  Within
      the XML instance, the following must be addressed:  <ul>    <li>Entity identification:
      Identify the five elements shown in the E3012-16 standard, including inputs,
      outputs, product and process information, resources, and transformation functions.</li>    <li>Nomenclature:
      Describe the nomenclature of all recorded entities represented in the structured
      form, including any computed values in the transformation functions. This should
      include information such as names of the computed values, its meaning, type
      of the input variable, and the unit in which the data is represented in the
      model.</li>    <li>Information sources: Source of the information used to define
      the UMP models, such as existing literature, industry case studies, and textbooks.</li>    <li>Constraints
      and bounds: For each recorded parameter and the model itself, describe the feasibility
      bounds. For example, material density cannot be a value less than zero.</li>  </ul>  To
      support the Information Model, the submission must also include a PDF file includes
      the following supporting information:    <strong>Introductory Information</strong>:
      Describe information about the submission and the participants, including the
      title and participant information.    <strong>Graphical Representation</strong>: 
      The five elements shown in the E3012-16 standard must also be clearly identified

      Identify inputs, which include information about the physical inputs to the
      process, such energy and material.</li>    <li>Outputs: Identify outputs, which
      include information about the physical outputs of the process, such as waste
      and finished parts.</li>    <li>Product and Process Information: Identify the
      necessary product and process information that would be required to instantiate
      the transformation functions, such as CAD files, CAM files, technical drawings,
      and specifications sheets.</li>    <li>Resources: Identify specific manufacturing
      assets, such as machines, tools, and operators, that would be required to instantiate
      the transformation functions.</li>    <li>Transformation Functions: Describe
      a series of equations that compute the output from the input.</li>  </ul>  Note:
      The Graphical Representation should match the XML instance as specified in the
      Information Model.  The purpose of the Graphical Representation is for presentation
      and communication.  If there are multiple UMPs submitted, a graphical representation
      for each UMP must be prepared.    <strong>Written Narrative</strong>: Describe
      in less than 1500 words how your entry meets the judging criteria and addresses
      this year''s theme, Tracking Resources and Flows through the System.  The written
      narrative should address the following topics.  <ul>    <li>Validation: Explain
      how the model is validated. An example of validation includes procuring the
      data (i.e., inputs and outputs) from a physical (or virtual) manufacturing setting
      and validating this output against the computed output from the transformation
      function that is run with inputs from the real manufacturing setting. Other
      approaches may be taken.</li>    <li>Novelty of UMP representation in addressing
      the Theme.  This can be demonstrated through the following:  <ul>    <li>Advancements
      to knowledge and understanding of UMP modeling through innovative and expressive
      representations and methodologies, novel formal representations, more accurate
      or specialized metric, metric representations that support cascading to higher
      production levels, or exploration of variations for families of UMP models.</li>    <li>Advancements
      to standards supporting reuse models. This may include automated methods that
      allow linking of UMP models into systems, facilitating system composition through
      naming conventions or other methods, generalization that unifies a collection
      of processes, or standards-based methods for integration with applications.</li>    <li>Advancement
      of techniques for development and validation of UMP models. This may include
      demonstration of validation techniques for the effectiveness and accuracy of
      the UMP models or techniques for producing useful derivatives of UMP models
      or creative methods for mining documentary model descriptions into formal representations.</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  <strong>Directions
      for submission: </strong>Multiple files may be submitted, but should be uploaded
      as a single file submission, as a ZIP file.  To clarify, your ZIP file should
      include XML documents for each UMP model and a PDF of the supporting information.    <span

      alt="" width="169" height="300" />    <strong>Model types:</strong> Any manufacturing
      process can be modeled for purposes of information sharing and sustainability
      assessment.  The modeled process can be one that you have uniquely studied,
      or from open literature or other 3<sup>rd</sup> party sources. Any size scale
      and manufacturing process type (batch, continuous, and discrete event) is acceptable. 
      Entry processes can span sizes from traditional scale down to nano-scale and
      be based on mechanical, electrical, chemical, biochemical, and bio technologies.
      Note that sustainability is a balance of competing objectives, including cost
      and time as well as environmental considerations, so many different types of
      process performance metrics may be considered.  In addition, the use of the
      models for system-level sustainability performance is a focus of this year''s
      competition.    <strong>Entries Allowed:</strong> Multiple entries are permitted.
      Each entry will be reviewed independently. Each entry must characterize at least
      one process yet participants can submit more than one model per entry. The participant
      must submit an analysis of a Unit Manufacturing Process that uses the <a href="https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.astm.org%2Fnist-ramp&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckevin.lyons%40nist.gov%7C81ab8bbf82f24ce2a2c608d536825246%7C2ab5d82fd8fa4797a93e054655c61dec%7C1%7C0%7C636474857162099167&amp;sdata=ePHyZgKeg0bpOSAEqvWabABmh1zEbdcHrwTf8LWpLvE%3D&amp;reserved=0"

description: 'On April 5, we held another live webinar that focused on submission
  guidelines for RAMP 2018 and improvements to the <a href="https://umpbuilder.nist.gov/"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">UMP Builder</a>, an open tool that helps participants
  record Unit Manufacturing Process models.   <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wp-content/2018/01/RAMP2018_ExampleSubmission.zip"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">An example submission of a Face Milling Model </a>was
  reviewed to help communicate the required components of a RAMP 2018 submission. 
   A transcript of the Q&amp;A during the live webinar will be made available via
  the discussion board.    You can find <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wp-content/2018/01/2018_RAMP_Webinar_2nd.pdf"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">a copy of the slides here</a>. <a href="https://www.nist.gov/video/ramp-2018-submission-packet-supporting-tools">You
  can access the webinar recording here.</a>    <hr />    On February 6, we held a
  live webinar to discuss the rules and logistics of RAMP 2018.  You can find the <a
  href="https://www.nist.gov/video/ramp-2018-challenge-webinar-what-how-and-where-enter">webinar
  recording here </a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wp-content/2018/01/2018_RAMP_Webinar.pdf">a
  copy of the slides here</a>.  The webinar also demonstrated a prototype tool to
  support RAMP 2018 called the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/unit-manufacturing-process-ump-builder">UMP
  Builder</a>, which can be accessed at <a href="https://umpbuilder.nist.gov/">https://umpbuilder.nist.gov/</a> 
  Please use the discussion board if you have any questions.    <hr />    In the future,
  manufacturing will be planned out in the virtual world. How can we do this if we
  don’t even have models for the basic processes such as welding, drilling, and forging?
  Sewing, assembly, or distillation? Nope, we don’t even have models for those either!
  At least, not the types of models really needed for our high-tech world.    Manufacturers
  need models to improve operations, to protect the environment, to share information,
  and to compose them into systems. Using your models will let manufacturers simulate,
  improve, and optimize all sorts of processes.    Showcase your manufacturing research
  by entering the RAMP 2018 Challenge!  Finalists will be invited to present their
  entries in a workshop at the <a href="https://www.asme.org/events/msec" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">co-located ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering
  Conference (MSEC) 2018 and the 46th NAMRI/SME North American Manufacturing Research
  Conference (NAMRC)</a> in College Station, TX, on June 18-22.  <strong>Click on

  alt="" width="150" height="150" />  <p style="text-align: left;">Similar to <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ramp-reusable-abstractions-of-manufacturing-processes-2017/"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year''s competition</a>, the building blocks
  of each submission are the Unit Manufacturing Process (UMP) models, which represent
  Reusable Abstractions of Manufacturing Processes (RAMP). Two of the main drivers
  within this Theme are sustainability and composability. Particular interest will
  be paid to those submissions that address some element of both drivers. Possible
  approaches that participants could take to address this year''s theme include (but
  are not limited to) the following:</p>    <ul>    <li>Composition of a set of UMP
  models to conduct material flow analysis (MFA)</li>    <li>Waste minimization for
  part manufacturing (or product assembly) using UMP models</li>    <li>Detailed sustainability
  analysis of a single process using multiple UMP representations</li>    <li>Environmental
  and economic tradeoff analysis using alternative UMP methods</li>    <li>Balanced
  benefits and burden related to sustainability of UMPs</li>  </ul>  <strong>New to
  2018 RAMP:  </strong>The most significant upgrade to this year''s competition is
  the new <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wp-content/2018/01/UMPSchema_for_user.xsd"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">UMP Schema</a> that must be followed for submission. 
   The schema is expressed as an <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">eXtensible Markup Language (XML) Schema Definition (XSD)</a>.  Participants
  can import the schema into any XML editing tool to help build their XML submissions. 
  Examples of well-formed XML documents built from the schema include an <a href="{{
  site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wp-content/2018/01/Atomic_Layer_Deposition1.xml" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">Atomic Layer Deposition UMP Model</a> and a <a href="{{ site.baseurl
  }}/assets/images/wp-content/2018/01/GPR_milling_model.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data-Driven
  Milling UMP Model</a>.  More information about the schema can be found in the Rules.    <img
