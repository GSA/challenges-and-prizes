  release </strong></a><strong>announcing the final, Phase 2 winners! Congratulations
  to them all!</strong></strong>    <strong> </strong>    The Provider User-Experience
  (UX) Challenge incents the development of applications that use open, standardized
  APIs to enable innovative ways for providers to interact with patient health data.
  This challenge will focus on demonstrating how data made accessible to apps through
  APIs can positively impact providers’ experience with EHRs by making clinical workflows
  more intuitive, specific to clinical specialty, and actionable.    The lack of interoperability
  between electronic health record (EHR) systems remains a significant barrier to
  the modernization of health IT. <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html"
  target="_blank">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources</a> (FHIR), developed
  by HL7, is a standard designed to increase the liquidity of granular patient data.
  The FHIR API allows data to move between vendor systems both within and across different
  providers, not to mention through third-party applications for direct use by both
  clinicians and consumers. Among several opportunities now enabled by this interoperability
  standard are the new channels being opened up for improving a provider’s user experience
  when interacting with EHRs and the “consumability” of interrelated health data.    <strong>***Watch
  the recording of the March 31 <a href="http://bit.ly/1SLG1gB">Informational Webinar</a>***</strong>    The
  challenge has two phases. Phase 1 requires the submission of technical and business
  plans for the application (app) while Phase 2 requires that a working app be available
  for consumers. Phase 2 of the competition will not be limited to only those who
  won Phase 1 – all Phase 1 competitors, and those who did not participate in Phase
  1, can submit a final app at the end of Phase 2. The final application must meet
  the following requirements:  <ul>    <li>Uses FHIR Draft Standard for Technical
  Use 2 (DSTU2)</li>    <li>Leverages data as specified in the 2015 Edition Common
  Clinical Data Set (in the <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/commonclinicaldataset_ml_11-4-15.pdf">Data
  column</a>)</li>    <li>Verified compatibility with different health IT developer
  systems implemented in production settings, 1 of which must be from the top 10 systems
  measured by Meaningful Use attestation per HealthIT.gov. Apps must be integrated
  with a minimum of 3 unique health IT developer systems in 2 unique provider settings.  <ul>    <li><span
  style="line-height: 1.5;">There are two options to assess MU attestation here, by

  style="line-height: 1.5;">. The top 10 system can be selected from Primary EHR Vendor
  – not Secondary EHR Vendor – in either of these reports.</span></li>  </ul>  </li>    <li>Has
  been tested with users in production settings</li>    <li>Available to providers through
  at least one of the following modes: direct from web, iOS Store, or Android Stores</li>  </ul>  &nbsp;    <strong>Phase
  2 Participation Requirements</strong>    The second phase, to run from <strong>June
  2 to November 7</strong>, will entail the actual development of the apps, verification
  of technical capabilities, user testing/piloting, and public release of the apps.
  This will include remote testing with providers and health IT developers to test
  the technical abilities of the apps to connect to in-production systems. Participants
  will submit:  <ul>    <li>Working app  <ul>    <li>Provide the url to download/access
  the app.</li>  </ul>  </li>    <li>Video demonstrating the app (maximum of 5 minutes)  <ul>    <li>Provide
  the url of the video on YouTube or Vimeo.</li>    <li>The video must highlight the
  use of FHIR to integrate with EHR vendor systems, including demonstration of data
  exchange with each system. The rest of the video should address the remaining evaluation
  criteria: functionality and quality of data aggregation, privacy and security of
  patient data, impact potential in a clinical setting, and user experience and visual
  appeal.</li>  </ul>  </li>    <li>Slide deck describing app (maximum of 15 slides)  <ul>    <li>Overall,
  the slide deck should complement the video demonstration. It should include a list
  of the active FHIR integrations with EHRs at provider settings, as demonstrated
  in the video. It should describe other functionality pertaining to the review criteria,
  particularly anything that was not covered in the video.</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  The
  grand prize winner will receive $50,000 and a second place winner will receive $25,000.
  There will be an additional $25,000 prize for the app that connects to the greatest
  number of unique health IT developer systems implemented in production settings
  (the "Ultimate Connector"), which can be won by any entry, including the grand prize
  or 2nd place winner.    <strong>Phase 1 Participation Requirements</strong>    Participants
  interested in competing for Phase 1 awards will need to submit an app development
  plan that must include:  <ul>    <li>Mockup/wireframes of the app  <ul>    <li>Provide
  a clear sense of the look, feel, and interactions of the app.</li>  </ul>  </li>    <li>Technical
  specifications, including but not limited to planned data sources, system architecture,
  and compliance with HIPAA regulations (and other applicable law)  <ul>    <li>Provide
  a realistic idea of what data sources, and from who, will be included; how that
  data will be integrated together and in service to the consumer’s needs; how data
  privacy and security will be implemented.</li>  </ul>  </li>    <li>Business/sustainability
  plan  <ul>    <li>How does the submitter propose to enter the market and lead to
  a successful app? The plan should include the following:  <ol>    <li>Issue analysis,
  demonstrating understanding of the issue (1 page)</li>    <li>Solution description,
  describing the solution and how it addresses the issues (2 pages)</li>    <li>Financial
  estimates, including revenues and expenses (2 pages)</li>    <li>Engagement plan,
  including targeted customer base and stakeholders (2 pages)</li>  </ol>  </li>  </ul>  </li>    <li>Provider
  partnership  <ul>    <li>Submitters are strongly encouraged to partner with a healthcare
  provider or EHR vendor for activities such as app development or pilot testing;
  evidence of partnership should be demonstrated with signed letters of intent on
  partner letterhead (i.e., we will not be reviewing actual business agreements).</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  To
  augment technical development and enhance the likelihood of a successful app that
  will continue to exist beyond the end of the challenge, a progress update/matchmaking
  event will be held that will seek to connect participants with provider partners.    In
  Phase 1, up to five app proposals will be recognized as winners and awarded up to
  $15,000 each.'
