      to obtain liability insurance for this Competition.    <strong>10. </strong><strong>Indemnification:</strong>
      Participants shall agree to indemnify the Federal Government against third party
      claims for damages arising from or related to Challenge activities.    <strong>11.
      Changes and Cancellation:</strong> Challenge Sponsor has the right to make updates
      and/or make any changes at any time during the Challenge. Innovators are responsible
      for regularly reviewing the official rules on <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/nist-virtual-public-safety-test-environment-challenge">Challenge.gov</a> and
      updates on the HeroX site <a href="https://herox.com/NISTvr" target="_blank"

      during the voting period. A competitor is eligible to win both a judges'' award
      and the popular choice award.    a. All votes are subject to review. Any competitor
      using unfair methods to solicit votes will be automatically disqualified from
      the challenge    b. Entries that are eligible for the Voting stage will become
      viewable to the public. Make sure that if your entry moves on to the Voting
      stage, that you''re OK with anyone seeing it! Depending on the number of entries

description: '<h3>Background</h3>  New technologies, including wearable interfaces
  like heads up displays, smart watches, and biological monitors have the potential
  to increase first responder safety while enhancing performance. However, variability
  in current testing procedures/environments pose a challenge in assessing the effectiveness
  of emerging technologies. To assess the potential of new technologies and compare
  technologies against each other, NIST is crowdsourcing ideas that use virtual/immersive
  environments in conjunction with physical spaces to create accurate first responder
  scenarios and a repeatable test environment for technology evaluation.  <ul>    <li>Your
  job is to propose a physical environment, along with immersive virtual reality tools,
  to facilitate the future of first response in a controlled and repeatable way.</li>    <li>Possible
  First Responder Scenarios, Metrics/ Data to be collected, and Technologies to be
  tested are included on the Resources Tab, provided by NIST.</li>    <li>This is
  an ideation prize only and does not require the development of virtual or physical
  spaces, only proposals.</li>  </ul>  <h4>Timeline</h4>  <ul>    <li>Open to submissions:
