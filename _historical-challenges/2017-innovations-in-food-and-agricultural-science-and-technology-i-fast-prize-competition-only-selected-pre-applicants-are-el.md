      Selected Pre-Applicants are Eligible)</a></h4>  <strong>Eligibility Rules for
      Participating in the Competition: </strong>    <em><strong>The I-FAST Competition
      is open to teams (“Teams” or “Participants”) that are made up of individuals
      from  academic/university institutions that have received a prior award from
      the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) (in a scientific
      or engineering field relevant to the proposed innovation) that is currently
      active or that has been active within five years from the date of the I-FAST
      Team’s proposal submission.</strong> </em>The lineage of the prior award extends
      to the PI, Co-PIs, Senior Personnel, Post Docs, Professional Staff or others
      who were supported under the NIFA award. The prior award could range from a
      modest single-investigator award to a large, distributed center and also includes
      awards involving students.    To be eligible to win a prize under the Competition,
      Teams:  <ul>    <li>Shall have registered to participate in the Competition
      under the rules;</li>    <li>Shall have complied with all the requirements of
      the Competition rules;</li>    <li>May not include a Federal entity or Federal
      employee acting within the scope of their employment; and</li>    <li>In the
      case of a private entity Team member, the member shall be incorporated in and
      maintain a primary place of business in the United States. In the case of an
      individual Team member, shall be a citizen or permanent resident of the United
      States.</li>  </ul>  Makeup of I-FAST Competition Teams: Each Team shall consist
      of three members:  <ul>    <li>Entrepreneurial Lead (EL)</li>    <li>I-FAST
      Team Mentor</li>    <li>Principal Investigator (PI)</li>  </ul>  I-FAST teams
      are made up of individuals from an academic/university institution except for
      the Mentor who may reside with an outside organization as described below.    The
      Entrepreneurial Lead (EL) could be a postdoctoral scholar, graduate, or other
      student with relevant knowledge of the technology located at the academic/university
      institution and a deep commitment to investigate the commercial landscape surrounding
      the innovation. The EL should also be capable and have the will to support the
      transition of the technology, should the I-FAST Team’s project demonstrate the
      potential for commercial viability. The EL will be responsible for: 1) developing
      the team to include the mentor and PI, 2) leading the development of the pre-application,
      participating in the I-FAST interviews and developing the full application,
      if selected, 3) starting and completing all training activities in the Entrepreneurial
      Immersion course provided by the NSF I-Corps program, 4) communicating and coordinating
      with team members to achieve the goals of the team, 5) developing and monitoring
      team activity milestones from the Entrepreneurial Immersion course, 6) ensuring
      the team milestones are completed on time, and 7) ensuring the team is in communication
      with the NIFA I-FAST Competition Director and the NSF I-Corps Program Director
      as needed.    The I-FAST Teams Mentor will typically be an experienced or emerging
      entrepreneur with proximity to the academic/university institution and have
      experience in transitioning technology out of the academic arena.  The Mentor
      should be selected as a third-party resource, or may be a person that has an
      established relationship with the team (e.g., Board Member), but cannot be an
      employee nor directly involved with the technology development. Ideally, the
      Industry Expert should have prior experience developing and commercializing
      other products within the broader technology space related to the specific project
      under development. The EL will need to identify a Mentor that has business expertise
      in the proposed technology sector and has entrepreneurial experience. A Mentor
      will be someone with the right “rolodex” of contacts in the technology area
      of commercialization which are critical for “getting the technology out of the
      university.” The EL of the team should contact their University Technology Transfer
      Office for ideas of potential Mentors. The I-FAST Team’s Mentor will be responsible
      for guiding the team forward using existing entrepreneurial experience and tracking
      the team’s progress through regular communication with the EL, PI, the NIFA
      I-FAST competition director, and the NSF I-Corps Program Director, as needed.    The
      PI will have in-depth knowledge of the innovation developed under the earlier
      USDA NIFA Grant and will be responsible for:  1) coordinating with the university
      on the transfer of prize funds from NIFA, if the team is selected, 2) tracking
      of the prize funding for team activities, 3) reporting to NIFA on disbursements
      and obligations of the prize funding, 4) guiding the EL and Mentor on technical
      aspects of the innovation, 5) communicating as needed with the NIFA I-FAST Competition
      Director and the NSF I-Corps Program Director, 6) ensuring the EL meets the
      required milestones for the NSF I-CORP training, and 7) participating as a team
      member.  The Principal Investigator who received the earlier NIFA grant for
      the technology is allowed to participate on the team, but cannot be the Entrepreneurial
      Lead.    During the I-Corps course, each participating team, including all its
      team members, will be required to:  <ul>    <li>Attend, in person, an evening
      reception and 3-day kick-off Entrepreneurial Immersion course;</li>    <li>Conduct
      approximately 100 customer interviews over the 6-week program, and submit interview
      summary reports. This process of customer discovery “outside the building” is
      expected to require a minimum of 15 hours per week for at least five weeks;</li>    <li>Participate
      in 5 weekly webinar sessions and submit regular updates to the team’s business
      model canvas. In addition, it is expected that I-Corps teams will take advantage
      of instructor office hours; and</li>    <li>Attend, in person, the final 2-day
      course close out/lessons learned session (to be held in the same region as the
      kick-off course).</li>  </ul>  If one or more team members cannot meet these
      requirements, the team should not pursue the program.'

description: '<h4><a class="title local-link" title="Link to Innovations in Food and
  Agricultural Science and Technology (I-FAST) (Only Selected Pre-Applicants are Eligible)"
  href="https://www.challenge.gov/?post_type=challenge&amp;p=141811">(Only Selected
  Pre-Applicants are Eligible)</a></h4>  <strong>SUMMARY:</strong> The National Institute
  of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is announcing the I-FAST prize competition (the “I-FAST
  Competition” or the “Competition”) to develop and implement the Innovations in Food
  and Agricultural Science and Technology (I-FAST) Program. USDA NIFA will partner
  with the National Science Foundation (NSF) Innovation Corps (I-Corps) to provide
  entrepreneurship training to USDA NIFA grantees under this I-FAST pilot program.
  The goals are to identify valuable product opportunities that can emerge from NIFA
  supported academic research. Selected USDA NIFA I-FAST project teams will have the
  opportunity to concurrently participate in the educational programs with NSF I-Corps
  awardees. Over a period of six months the USDA NIFA supported teams in the I-FAST
  program will learn what it will take to achieve an economic impact with their particular
  innovation. The final goal of the I-FAST Competition is to facilitate technology
  transfer of innovations that can make an impact in the marketplace and the global
  economy.    <strong>Subject of the Challenge Competition:</strong>    The USDA National
  Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) mission is to invest in and advance agricultural
  research, education, and extension to solve societal challenges.  As part of this
  mission NIFA is charged with providing grant funding for research, education, and
  extension that address key problems of national, regional, and multi-state importance
  in sustaining all components of agriculture. A majority of NIFA grant funding is
  provided to academic institutions to focus on developing research in the areas of
  farm efficiency and profitability, ranching, renewable energy, forestry (both urban
  and agroforestry), aquaculture, rural communities and entrepreneurship, human nutrition,
  food safety, biotechnology, and conventional breeding.    USDA NIFA will partner
  with the NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) who will provide an Entrepreneurial Immersion
  course and training to USDA NIFA grantees through this I-FAST Competition. The goals
  of this Competition are to spur translation of fundamental research to the market
  place, to encourage collaboration between academia and industry, and to train NIFA-funded
  faculty, students and other researchers to understand innovation and entrepreneurship.    The
  purpose of the I-FAST Competition is to identify NIFA-funded research teams who
  will receive additional support, in the form of mentoring, training, and funding
  to accelerate the translation of knowledge derived from fundamental research into
  emerging products and services that can attract subsequent third-party funding.
  NIFA-funded research teams will be required to participate in Entrepreneurial Immersion
  courses provided by the NSF I-Corps program. Each team that receives an I-FAST award
  is required to participate in the following NSF I-CORP activities: 1) Attendance
  by the entire team at an on-site three-day NSF I-CORP Entrepreneurial Immersion
  course; 2) Mandatory participation in the I-CORPs weekly Webinars following the
  in-person three day on-site meeting; 3) Completion of approximately 15 hours of
  preparation per week over the duration of the program; 4) Attendance of a two day
  lessons learned in-person meeting at the end of the training. During the training,
  teams are expected to engage in at least 100 contacts with potential customers and
  provide a 5-page summary report back to USDA NIFA on the outcome of the training
  and milestones to be met by the team (i.e., commercialization, market proposition,
  and lessons learned from the program). The major focus of I-FAST is for the selected
  teams (an I-FAST team includes the Principal Investigator (PI), the Entrepreneurial
  Lead, and the Mentor) to participate in an Entrepreneurial Immersion course provided
  by the NSF I-Corps program. The NSF I-Corps is a program specifically designed to
  broaden the impact of select, basic research projects by preparing scientists and
  engineers to focus beyond the laboratory. Leveraging experience and guidance from
  established entrepreneurs and a targeted curriculum within the NSF I-Corp program,
  USDA I-FAST teams will learn to identify valuable product opportunities that can
  emerge from USDA NIFA supported academic research. The I-FAST Competition will help
  create a stronger national ecosystem for innovation that couples scientific discovery
  with technology development to address agricultural and societal needs.    <strong>DATES:</strong>
