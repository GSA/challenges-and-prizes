      Register</a> and copied below for your convenience. In the event of any discrepancy,
      the Federal Register Notice posted in the Federal Register serves as the official
      document of the rules.    <strong>RULES </strong>    In 2011, President Obama
      issued a Presidential Memorandum – <em>Accelerating Technology Transfer and
      Commercialization of Federal Research in Support of High-Growth Businesses</em>
      - which called on Federal agencies to establish performance goals, metrics,
      evaluation methods, and implementation plans to improve the effectiveness of
      Federal technology transfer activities.  The President’s charge has stimulated
      agency interest in studies that assess the impact of technologies transferred
      from Federal laboratories.    In an effort to encourage research in this area,
      the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the <em>Journal of Technology
      Transfer</em> present a Federal Impact Assessment (FIA) Challenge for researchers
      to develop impact studies of Federal technology transfer activities.    The
      FIA Challenge calls on researchers to perform original retrospective studies
      that assess the impact of federally developed technologies that 1) have been
      developed completely or in part by Federal researchers working at any Federal
      agency at any time over the past 30 years, and 2) have been transferred to an
      entity other than the agency which developed the technology.    <strong>DATES:
      </strong>    <em>Submission Period: </em>September 27, 2016 - March 31, 2017    <em>Announcement
      of Winners: </em>April 28, 2017    The Submission Period begins September 27, 2016,
      at 9:00 AM Eastern Time (ET) and ends March 31, 2017, at 5:00 PM ET.  Prize
      competition dates are subject to change at the discretion of NIST.  Entries
      submitted before or after the Submission Period will not be reviewed or considered
      for award.    &nbsp;    <strong>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</strong>    Changes
      or updates to the prize competition rules will be posted and can be viewed at
      the Event Website, <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/federal-impact-assessment-challenge">https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/federal-impact-assessment-challenge</a>.    Questions
      about the prize competition can be directed to NIST via the Event Website or
      by email to Michael Walsh at michael.walsh@nist.gov, phone 301-975-5455.    Results
      of the prize competition will be announced on the Event Website and on the NIST
      website, www.nist.gov.    <strong> </strong>    <strong>FIA Challenge Sponsors</strong>    The
      National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST; <a href="http://www.nist.gov">www.nist.gov</a>)
      is a non-regulatory Federal agency within the United States Department of Commerce.
      Founded in 1901, NIST''s mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial
      competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology
      in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. NIST''s
      Technology Partnerships Office (TPO) is part of NIST’s Innovation and Industry
      Services directorate that is responsible for the NIST suite of partnership programs.
      TPO works with regional, state and local economic development organizations,
      technology incubation centers, public-private business development initiatives,
      and other organizations and partnerships, to facilitate the transfer of technologies
      developed within NIST laboratories to the private and nonprofit sectors through
      licensing and/or collaboration. NIST scientists conduct measurement science
      research, create technologies and make discoveries in nearly every scientific
      and technological field.    The <em>Journal of Technology Transfer</em> (<a
      href="http://link.springer.com/journal/10961">http://link.springer.com/journal/10961</a>),
      the official journal of the Technology Transfer Society, provides an international
      forum for the exchange of ideas that enhance and build an understanding of the
      practice of technology transfer. In particular, it emphasizes research on management
      practices and strategies for technology transfer. Moreover, the journal explores
      the external environment that affects these practices and strategies, including
      public policy developments, regulatory and legal issues, and global trends.    <strong> </strong>    <strong>Eligibility
      Rules for Participating in the FIA Challenge</strong>    At the time of Entry,
      participants must meet the following Eligibility Rules:    The FIA Challenge
      is open to all individuals over the age of 18 that are residents of the 50 United
      States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam,
      the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa, and to
      for-profit or non-profit corporations, institutions, or other validly formed
      legal entities organized or incorporated in, <em>and</em> which maintain a primary
      place of business in, any of the preceding jurisdictions.  An individual, whether
      participating singly or with a group, must be a citizen or permanent resident
      of the United States.    Federal employees are not eligible to participate.
      Any individuals or legal entities that have received Federal funds for the development
      of any part of a submission are ineligible.  Any other individuals or legal
      entities involved with the design, production, execution, distribution or evaluation
      of the FIA Challenge, are also not eligible to participate.    A Participant
      shall not be deemed ineligible because the Participant consulted with Federal
      employees or used Federal facilities in preparing its submission to the FIA
      Challenge if the employees and facilities are made available to all Participants
      on an equitable basis.  Note that while Federal employees may provide information
      to Participants they are not obligated to respond to information requests within
      the time frame of this Challenge. The task of gathering information for this
      Challenge in a timely manner is the sole responsibility of the Participant.    To
      be eligible to win a Cash Award, a Participant (whether an individual or legal
      entity) must have registered to participate and must have complied with all
      requirements under section 3719 of title 15, United States Code (“Prize competitions”).    Multiple
      entries are permitted.  Each entry will be reviewed independently.  Multiple
      individuals and/or legal entities may collaborate as a group to submit a single
      entry, in which case all members of the group must satisfy the eligibility requirements,
      and a single individual from the group must be designated as an official representative
      for each entry.  That designated individual will be responsible for meeting
      all entry and evaluation requirements.  Participation is subject to all U.S.
      federal, state and local laws and regulations.  Individuals entering on behalf
      of or representing a company, institution or other legal entity are responsible
      for confirming that their entry does not violate any policies of that company,
      institution or legal entity.    &nbsp;    <strong>Entry Process for Participants</strong>    To
      enter, visit the Event Website, <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/federal-impact-assessment-challenge">https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/federal-impact-assessment-challenge</a>.
      Submit a Federal Impact Assessment (hereafter, “Paper”) that meets the selection
      criteria described below.    The FIA Challenge calls on Participants to write
      an original Paper describing a retrospective assessment of the economic and/or
      societal impacts resulting from the transfer of a Federal technology developed
      completely or in part by Federal researchers working at any Federal agency at
      any time over the past 30 years.    For this FIA Challenge, “Federal technologies”
      are those techniques, machines, articles of manufacture, compositions of matter,
      methods, processes, tools, or works of authorship, whether or not patentable
      or copyrightable, that were invented or developed in whole or in part by one
      or more Federal employees during the course of their employment duties.    Transfer
      of a Federal technology (technology transfer) is the use of that technology
      by an entity outside of the agency where the Federal employee(s) was assigned. 
      There are many different means by which the Federal government seeks to transfer
      technologies. Technologies can be transferred through formal agreements (e.g.,
      licenses, or Cooperative Research and Development Agreements) or through informal
      exchanges (e.g., publications, conference presentations or informal collaborations).    Eligible
      technologies must meet two criteria, namely 1) the technology must have been
      developed in whole or in part by a Federal employee(s) during the course of
      his or her employment duties at any time over the past 30 years, and 2) the
      technology must have been transferred outside the Federal agency in a manner
      that can be traced back to that Federal agency. Technologies that have been
      developed entirely outside of a Federal agency or that have been developed entirely
      by non-Federal employees (even though with federal funding) are not eligible.
      Technologies that have not been transferred by a Federal agency are also not
      eligible.  Information about federally transferred technologies and technology
      transfer success stories can be found on the Federal Laboratories Consortium
      (FLC) website at <a href="http://www.federallabs.org">www.federallabs.org</a>. 
       For a list of Federal agencies that prepare annual technology transfer reports,
      see <a href="http://nist.gov/tpo/publications/agency-technology-transfer-reports.cfm">http://nist.gov/tpo/publications/agency-technology-transfer-reports.cfm</a>.    For
      the FIA Challenge, it is envisioned that impacts of a given Federal technology(ies)
      are determined by an assessment of repercussions that have accrued to those
      who have either utilized Federal technologies in research or development activities,
      and/or consumed goods or services enabled by Federal technologies.  The objective
      of the FIA Challenge is to develop metrics that measure economic and societal
      impacts. These metrics will then be available to stakeholders and policy makers
      to evaluate the net impact of federally developed technologies (i.e., impact
      less development costs).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>  Impacts may
      be assessed at the local, regional, national, or global levels using economic
      data or other societal data (e.g., measures of health, safety, or security). 
      A variety of assessment methodologies could be used by Participants in this
      Challenge.  Examples of commonly used approaches can be found in the citations
      provided by NIST online at <a href="http://nist.gov/tpo/publications/other-economic-impact-related-studies.cfm">http://nist.gov/tpo/publications/other-economic-impact-related-studies.cfm</a>.    Papers
      submitted to this challenge that have previously been published or that have
      been prepared using Federal funds are not eligible (e.g., Federal agency reports,
      reports prepared by Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, or reports
      prepared by funded intermediaries on behalf of Federal agencies.)    A complete
      Entry includes your Paper (including any figures, tables, and references), the
      email address of the Participant who is officially representing the Entry, and
      confirmation that you have read and agree to the Competition Rules contained
      in this Notice.  Participants may provide submissions beginning at 9:00 AM ET
      on September 27<sup>th</sup>, 2016, to the Event Website.  Submission can be
      made no later than 5:00 PM ET on March 31, 2017, to the Event Website.    &nbsp;    Submissions
      before the start date and time, or after the end date and time, will not be
      evaluated or considered for award.  Entries sent to NIST in any manner other
      than through the Event Website will not be evaluated or considered for award. 
      Entries that do not comply with the formatting requirements set forth in this
      Notice will not be evaluated or considered for award.    Entries must be complete,

      transferred from a Federal agency,</li>    <li>provide a complete description
      of the impact methodology, including a description of the metrics used for the
      impact assessment. Citations of Federal technologies must be provided, for example
      by listing patent numbers, as well as citations of the transfer of the technologies
      to the private sector, for example by listing products and companies using licensed
      Federal technologies,</li>    <li>meet the Evaluation Criteria described below
      in the Evaluation, Judging, and Selection of Winner(s) sections, and</li>    <li>include
      original figures, tables, and text passages or, if any of these have been published
      elsewhere, Participants must have obtained written permission, at Participants’
      sole expense, from the copyright owner(s) for both the irrevocable use and distribution
      by NIST of the figure, tables, or text passages, in both print and online formats
      and evidence that such permission has been granted must be provided in the Paper.
      Any material received without such evidence will be assumed to originate from
      the authors;</li>  </ol>  c) must include in a separate section on the title
      page of the Paper, an acknowledgement of any individuals, grants, funds, or
      other entities that provided support for the Paper. Participants must disclose
      all relationships or interests that could have direct or potential influence
      or impart bias on the work.    &nbsp;    <strong>FIA Challenge Award(s)</strong>    The
      Prize Purse for the FIA Challenge is a total of $20,000. The Prize Purse may
      increase, but will not decrease. Any increases in the Prize Purse will be posted
      on the Event Website and published in the Federal Register.  The Prize Purse
      will be used to fund one or more awards.    NIST will announce via the Event
      Website any Entry(ies) as to which the Judges have made a cash award (each,
      an “Award”).  The anticipated number and amount of the Awards that will be awarded
      for this Competition is set forth in this Federal Register Notice; however,
      the Judges are not obligated to make all or any Awards, and reserve the right
      to award fewer than the anticipated number of Awards in the event an insufficient
      number of eligible Entries meet any one or more of the Judging Criteria for
      this Competition, based on the Judges'' evaluation of the quality of Entries
      and in their sole discretion.  Awards will be made based on the Judges’ evaluation
      of an Entry’s compliance with the Judging Criteria for this Competition.  All
      potential winners will be notified by the e-mail address provided in the submission
      document and may be required to complete further documentation confirming their
      eligibility.  Return of any notification as “undeliverable” will result in disqualification. 
      After verification of eligibility, Awards will be distributed in the form of
      a check or electronic funds transfer addressed to the official representative
      specified in the winning Entry.  That official representative will have sole
      responsibility for further distribution of any Award among Participants in a
      group Entry or within a company or institution that has submitted an Entry through
      that representative.  Each list of Entries receiving Awards for the Competition
      will be made public according to the timeline outlined on the Event Website.    Winners
      are responsible for all taxes and reporting related to any Award received as
      part of the Competition.    All costs incurred in the preparation of Competition
      Entries are to be borne by Participants.    &nbsp;    <strong>Evaluation, Judging,
      and Selection of Winner(s)</strong>    <em>Submission Evaluation Criteria </em>    This
      section discusses how Participant submissions will be evaluated.    <em>Entry
      Submission and Review</em>    The requirements for submission of a complete
      Entry are detailed in the section “Entry Process for Participants.”  Each Paper
      will be reviewed by up to three subject matter experts.  Each subject matter
      expert will assess how well the Paper addressed each of the following evaluation
      criteria. For each criterion, subject matter experts will assign a numerical
      score and will provide a brief (50 to 100 word) assessment of how well that
      criterion was met.    <em>Evaluation Criteria</em>  <ol>    <li>Description
      of the technology. (20 points)</li>  </ol>  Papers must include a description
      of the technology being analyzed. In addition to describing the function and
      purpose of the technology, the description must also identify where and when
      the technology was developed, when the technology was transferred, and how the
      technology was transferred. Papers will be evaluated based on the presentation
      of a clear and adequate description of the technology being assessed.  <ol start="2">    <li>Description
      of the demand environment. (30 points)</li>  </ol>  Papers must include a description
      of the demand environment. The demand environment is the environment in which
      the technology is utilized after it has been transferred from the agency. Papers
      should describe the types and number of individuals and/or organizations that
      utilize the technology.  This should include researchers, consumers, and companies
      that make up the markets and industries affected. Papers will be evaluated based
      on the presentation of a clear and adequate description of the demand environment.  <ol
      start="3">    <li>Description of methodologies used to gather and assess impact
      data. (20 points)</li>  </ol>  Papers must include a description of how impact
      data was gathered and assessed. This includes a description of all data sources,
      techniques used to clean, adjust or normalize data, and statistical methods
      employed.  Papers will be evaluated based on the creativity and appropriateness
      of the methodology used to gather data and assess impacts.  <ol start="4">    <li>Description
      of the economic and/or societal impacts that resulted from the technology transferred
      from the Federal agency. (30 points)</li>  </ol>  Papers must describe the economic
      and/or societal impact that resulted from the utilization of the technology
      once transferred from the agency. The description must be based on the evidence
      gathered and the statistical method(s) used to assess impacts in the demand
      environment. The description must include clearly defined metrics that allow
      for the benchmarking of impacts over time. Papers will be evaluated based on
      the degree to which reported impacts are presented in an accurate, unbiased,
      comprehensive, and convincing manner.    Up to 15 Papers will be selected for
      evaluation by the Judges. Selected papers will be the lesser of either (1) all
      papers with an average subject matter expert score of 70 or higher, or (2) the
      top 15 papers with the highest average subject matter expert scores.    A panel
      of three judges will then be convened to rank the selected Papers.    Judges
      will review each of the selected Papers and the corresponding reviews provided
      by subject matter experts. Judges will deliberate and then rank them using the
      following <strong>equally weighted</strong> Judging Criteria.  <ul>    <li><strong>Novelty
      of the Approach</strong> – The extent to which each Paper describes a new, creative,
      or innovative approach to capturing the impact of a Federally funded technology(ies).</li>    <li><strong>Scope
      of the Assessment</strong> – The extent to which each Paper addresses the scope
      of impact from the transfer of a Federally funded technology.</li>    <li><strong>Quality
      of the Paper</strong> – The extent to which each Paper present a high-quality,
      well-reasoned and compelling argument for capturing the impact of a federal
      funded technology(ies).</li>  </ul>  Participant(s) who submitted a Paper that
      is among the top four Papers ranked by the Judges will receive $5,000 and an
      invitation to have the Paper considered for publication in a special issue of<em>
      The Journal of Technology Transfer</em> (“Journal”), or another issue as determined
      by the Journal’s editorial board. Participants accepting this invitation who
      submit their Paper to the Journal must comply with the Journal’s “Instructions
      for Authors.” (See:<a href="http://www.springer.com/business+%26+management/journal/10961">http://www.springer.com/business+%26+management/journal/10961</a>)    Papers
      submitted will be peer-reviewed using the processes of the Journal, and acceptance
      for publication is wholly within the Journal’s discretion, and is not guaranteed.    <em>Subject
      Matter Experts and Judging Panel</em>    Subject Matter Experts, to be selected
      by NIST, will, as a body, represent a high degree of experience with impact
      assessment and federally funded technologies. Subject Matter Experts will consist
      of Federal employees and will be subject matter experts in the technology field.
      Subject Matter Experts will not select winners of any awards.    The NIST Director
      will appoint a panel of highly qualified Judges. The Judging Panel will consist
      of three individuals who are experts in the field of assessing economic or societal
      impacts. Judges will deliberate and rank Papers according to the Judging Criteria
      described above. The top four Papers ranked by the Judges will be selected to
      receive an Award. Judges may not have personal or financial interests in, or
      be an employee, officer, director, or agent of, any entity that is a registered
      Participant in this Competition and may not have a familial or financial relationship
      with an individual who is a registered Participant. In the event of such a conflict,
      a Judge must recuse himself or herself. In the event that this occurs a new
      Judge may be appointed to the panel.    &nbsp;    <strong>Intellectual Property

description: Did you know that every year the Federal government invests over $135
  billion in research and development? Almost one-third of these funds support intramural
  research - by Federal researchers within Federal laboratories - covering a wide
  range of technologies with applications in aerospace, biotechnology, chemical engineering,
  communications, electronics, and much, much more. Many of the technologies developed
  by Federal researchers are transferred to the private sector through formal agreements
  (e.g. patents, licenses, or cooperative research and development agreements) or
  through informal exchanges (e.g. publications, conference presentations or collaborations). Without
  doubt these Federal investments have yielded extraordinary long-term impacts, creating
  new knowledge and ultimately new industries. But we need more efforts to quantify
  these impacts. How can we most accurately and completely capture the economic and
  societal impact of federal technology transfer activities? This challenge calls
  on you to analyze a federally-developed technology that has been transferred to
  the private sector, and present the results in a paper suitable for an archival
  publication.    [embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrhpLt0-auw[/embed]    <strong>Why
  this Challenge?</strong> Despite the proliferation of Federal research and the profound
  effect that many Federally-developed technologies have upon our everyday life, more
  effort is needed to assess the impact of these technologies -- as emphasized in
  President Obama's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/10/28/presidential-memorandum-accelerating-technology-transfer-and-commerciali">2011
  Memorandum Accelerating Technology Transfer and Commercialization of Federal Research
  in Support of High-Growth Businesses</a>. The National Institute of Standards and
  Technology (NIST) and the Journal of Technology Transfer aim to stimulate efforts
  in this area through this Challenge.    <strong>What is a Federally developed technology?</strong>
  Eligible technologies for this Challenge must meet two criteria, namely 1) the technology
  must have been developed in whole or in part by a Federal employee(s) during the
  course of their employment duties at any time over the past 30 years, and 2) the
  technology must have been transferred in a manner that can be traced back to the
  agency. Information about federally transferred technologies and technology transfer
  success stories can be found on the Federal Laboratories Consortium (FLC) website
  at <a href="http://www.federallabs.org">www.federallabs.org</a>.   See a list of
  Federal agencies that prepare annual <a href="http://nist.gov/tpo/publications/agency-technology-transfer-reports.cfm">technology
  transfer reports</a>.    <strong>How do I assess one?</strong>    The objective
  of this Challenge is to identify and measure economic and societal impacts that
  result from the transfer of Federally developed technologies.  <ul>    <li>First,
   identify a technology that was developed in a Federal agency. Information about
  federally transferred technologies can be found on the Federal Laboratories Consortium
  (FLC) website at <a href="http://www.federallabs.org/">www.federallabs.org</a> as
  well as individual Federal agency websites, including NIST's <a href="https://www.nist.gov/tpo">Technology
  Partnerships Office</a>. NIST provides a <a href="https://www.nist.gov/tpo/agency-technology-transfer-reports">list
  of Federal agencies that issue annual technology transfer reports</a>.</li>    <li>Next,
  research the impact of this technology by examining who is using the technology, how
  they are using it, and what impacts have resulted from its use.  Impacts may be
  assessed at the local, regional, national, or global levels using economic data
  or other societal data (e.g., measures of health, safety, or security).</li>    <li>Finally, prepare
  an original paper describing your research and the impact that you have identified.
  Your paper should clearly describe the technology you are assessing and include
  evidence of how it has been used since being transferred.  Note that a variety of
  assessment methodologies could be used by Participants in this Challenge including,
  but not limited to, <a href="https://www.nist.gov/tpo/nist-economic-impact-studies">NIST's
  economic impact studies</a> and these <a href="https://www.nist.gov/tpo/other-agency-economic-impact-studies">examples
  of commonly used approaches</a>.</li>  </ul>  <strong>Who should participate?</strong>
  This Challenge is open to anyone (or any organization) that meets the eligibility
  requirements described in the Rules. You do not need to be a technology expert or
  economist, but you should have an appetite for research and some familiarity with
  methods of impact analysis. Teaming is encouraged because of the scope and diversity
  of potential technology transfer studies, from understanding the technology to tracking
  its transfer and assessing its impact.    <strong>To enter:</strong> Submit a research
  paper that identifies a federally developed technology and analyzes the economic
  or social or economic impact that occurred as a result of it being transferred outside
  of the federal agency in which it was developed.  If your paper is selected as a
  winner, you will receive a $5,000 cash award and you will be invited to have your
  paper considered for publication in <em>The Journal of Technology Transfer</em>.
  pp    <strong>Before you begin, carefully review the Rules to make sure you are
  eligible to Participate and for more details about the Challenge. Use these <a href="{{
