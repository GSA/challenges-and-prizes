  for protecting human health. Drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities
  are subject to <span class="il">arsenic</span> regulations in order to limit human
  exposure and environmental contamination. While current analytical methods are suitable
  for ensuring regulatory compliance, there is a need for rapid, low-cost monitoring
  of <span class="il">arsenic</span> that would benefit water treatment plant operations,
  wastewater monitoring, contaminated site remediation, private well owners, scientific
  research and other interested parties.    [embed]https://youtu.be/b4KlE4XoY3I[/embed]    <em><strong>Go
