description: 'In recognition of Native American Heritage Month, the National Institutes
  of Health (NIH) announces the “Storytelling about Health and Wellness in American
  Indian and Alaska Native Communities” Challenge. The goal of this Challenge is to
  develop a brief digital story (i.e., a video) that communicates how traditions and
  heritage promote health in American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). The NIH
  invites the public to participate to share stories about: 1) how heritage and tradition
  leads to health and wellness in AI/AN communities; and 2) how future research can
  improve the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives. The videos will augment
  the agency’s ongoing efforts to inform a strengthened research portfolio that advances
  AI/AN research needs. This challenge is also designed to attract more interest and
  attention to the research needs of these communities and communicate these needs
  in a culturally appropriate manner.    Submissions are limited to a video that may
  not exceed five minutes. Submissions must be substantially free of scientific jargon
  and understandable by viewers without scientific/technical backgrounds. The video
  must include at least one member of a federally recognized tribe(s) and address
  the following:  <ul>    <li>A brief historical background that puts the story in
  context. For example, what is the traditional or cultural practice? How does it
  contribute to health and wellness in AI/AN populations?</li>    <li>A description
  of how this tradition or culture affects people’s lives. The impact could be lives
  saved, suffering reduced, fewer visits to health care facilities, adopting a healthier
  lifestyle, and similar such benefits. How is this practice promoted within tribal
  populations?</li>    <li>Information about the unmet health and wellness needs of
  AI/AN communities. What is the unmet need? Is there an understanding of what interventions
  or actions may help address these needs?</li>    <li>A discussion of how biomedical
  or behavioral research can further Tribal health and wellness. What are the current
  gaps in Tribal health research and opportunities for improving health in AI/AN communities? 
  What are some of the barriers or challenges in closing these gaps?  How would addressing
  them reduce mortality, improve quality of life, or otherwise positively affect Tribal
  communities?  The video must convey the research question of interest as part of
  a holistic picture of Tribal health or AI/AN communities.</li>  </ul>  Contestants
  must include a link to a public or unlisted video on YouTube.com, Vimeo.com, or
  other internet accessible site. The submission may be disqualified if the video
  is primarily promotional, contains inappropriate material or language, or presents
  material unrelated to this challenge, as determined by the NIH.  A video must:  <ul>    <li>Be
  in English if dialogue is present. Use of Native language is encouraged but must
  include an English caption or other method of translation to English.</li>    <li>Be
  no longer than five minutes. The NIH recognizes that there may be a desire to prepare
  a longer video. However, any part of a video exceeding five minutes will be disregarded
  as part of the judging process.</li>    <li>Not include copyrighted material, such
  as music or photos, unless the Contestant has obtained written permission to use
  such material.</li>    <li>Not include proprietary information.</li>    <li>For
  any video with dialogue, captioning must be included or a written transcript of
  the video must be submitted in English to ensure the video can be understood by
  viewers with disabilities.  <ul>    <li>The video must remain posted at the URL
  submitted with the entry for at least one year after the Challenge closes. The video
  (or the link to it) may be displayed publicly on the NIH web site.</li>    <li>Before
  posting a video online, a Contestant must obtain consent from anyone appearing in
  the video. If a minor appears in the video, the contestant must obtain consent from
  the minor’s parent or legal guardian.</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  <h4>Technical Evaluation
  Panel</h4>  Submissions first will be assessed by a technical evaluation panel consisting
  of individuals who will review the relevance of the entry to the AI/AN communities,
  the accuracy of the advance and impact on AI/ANs, cultural sensitivity, and confirmation
  of the unmet research need(s) in AI/AN populations.'
