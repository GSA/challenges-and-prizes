challenge-title: Design the Human Factors Engineering Lab (HFEL) Graphic
tagline: The goal of this challenge is to create a graphic to be used by the Human Factors Engineering Lab (HFEL) team. Living and working in space presents unique challenges unlike those experienced on Earth. The human factors specialists in the HFEL at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) study the human both physically and psychologically in order to design and develop the tools, equipment, and vehicles that astronauts need to successfully and safely perform their work on missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond. The lab provides evaluation, testing, and analysis for the design of human system interactions including displays and controls, workstations, and vehicle/habitat environments.
