    rules: "<h4><strong>Eligibility to Participate</strong></h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Each
      Competition Solver (individual, team, or legal entity) is required to register
      through email participation in Phase I as described in these competition rules.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>There
      shall be one Official Representative for each Competition Entry. The Official
      Representative must provide a name, email address, and affirm that he or she
      has read and consents to be governed by the Competition Rules.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>As
      determined by GSA, any violation of these rules will be grounds for disqualification
      from the Competition.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Multiple individuals and/or legal entities
      may collaborate as a Solver team to submit a single entry, in which case the
      designated Official Representative will be responsible for meeting all entry
      and evaluation requirements.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Participation is subject to all
      U.S. Federal, state, local, and country of residence laws and regulations.</li>\r\n<li>Solvers
      must not be suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded from doing business with
      the Federal Government. An individual or entity that is determined to be on
      the GSA Excluded Parties List (www.sam.gov) is ineligible to participate. Individuals
      entering on behalf of or representing a company, institution or other legal
      entity are responsible for confirming that their entry does not violate any
      policies of that company, institution or legal entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>As
      a condition of participation, all participants must agree to indemnify the Federal
      Government against third-party claims for damages arising from or related to
      competition activities. Entrants are not required to obtain liability insurance
      or demonstrate financial responsibility in order to participate in the competition.
      By entering the contest, Solvers agree to hold GSA harmless from all legal and
      administrative claims to include associated expenses that may arise from any
      claims related to their entry or its use.</li>\r\n<li>​By participating in th​e
      Competition, each ​Solver (individual, team, or legal entity​) warrants that
      he or she is the sole author or owner of, or has the right to use, any copyrightable
      works that the Submission comprises, that the works are wholly original with
      the Solver (or is an improved version of an existing work that the Solver has
      sufficient rights to use and improve), and that the Submission does not infringe
      any copyright or any other rights of any third party of which Solver is aware.
      To receive an award, Solvers will not be required to transfer their intellectual
      property rights to ​GSA, but Solvers must grant to the Federal government a
      nonexclusive license to practice their solutions and use the materials that
      describe them. This license must grant to the United States government a nonexclusive,
      non-transferable, irrevocable, paid-up, royalty-free license to practice or
      have practiced for or on behalf of the United States throughout the world any
      invention made by the Solvers that covers the Submission. In addition, the license
      must grant to the Federal government and others acting on its behalf, a fully
      paid, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license in any copyrightable works
      that the Submission comprises, including the right to reproduce, prepare derivative
      works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly
      said copyrightable works. To participate in the Challenge, each Solver must
      warrant that there are no legal obstacles to providing the above-referenced
      nonexclusive licenses of Solver&rsquo;s rights to the Federal government.</li>\r\n<li>Federal
      grantees may not use Federal funds to develop competition solutions unless consistent
      with the purpose of their grant award.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Federal contractors
      may not use Federal funds from a contract to develop competition applications
      or to fund efforts in support of a competition entry.</li>\r\n<li>Participants
      may not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their
      employment. Non-GSA, non-OMB Federal employees acting in their personal capacities
      should consult with their respective agency ethics officials to determine whether
      their participation in this Competition is permissible.</li>\r\n<li>Any other
      individuals or legal entities involved with the design, production, execution,
      distribution or evaluation of the GEAR Center Prize Competition are not eligible
      to participate.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Eligibility to

      in this competition agree, as a condition for winning a cash prize, to complete
      and submit all requested winner verification and payment documents to GSA within
      three (3) business days of formal notification. Failure to return all required
      verification documents by the date specified in the notification may be a basis
      for disqualification of the winning entry.</li>\r\n<li>A Solver shall not be
      deemed ineligible because the Solver consulted with Federal employees or used
      Federal facilities in preparing its submission to the GEAR Prize Competition
      if the Federal employees and facilities are made available to all Solvers on
      an equitable basis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Interested Solvers who are eligible
      to participate but not to win a cash prize are encouraged to enter the GEAR
      Competition. The participation of these Solvers will be displayed on the GEAR

      or Solver team certifies, through entry to the contest, that the entry is his/her
      own original, creative work and does not violate or infringe upon the creative
      work of others, as protected under applicable intellectual property law.</li>\r\n<li>By
      entering the contest, the Solvers agree to hold GSA harmless from all legal
      and administrative claims to include associated expenses that may arise from
      any claims related to their entry or its use.</li>\r\n<li>All evaluation panel
      decisions are final and may not be appealed.</li>\r\n<li>Winners are responsible
      for all taxes or other fees connected with the prize received.</li>\r\n<li>GSA
      reserves the right for any reason, including but not limited to an insufficient
      number of qualified entries, to modify or cancel the competition at any time
      during the duration of the competition.</li>\r\n<li>All registered participants
      agree that they, their heirs and estates agree to assume any and all risks and
      waive claims against the Federal Government and its related entities, except
      in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of
      property, revenue, or profits, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising
      from their participation in a prize competition, whether the injury, death,
      damage, or loss arises through negligence or otherwise.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>By
      participating in the competition, each Solver agrees to comply with and abide
      by all GEAR Center Challenge rules, terms, and conditions, and the decisions
      of GSA and/or the individual judges, which shall be final and binding in all
      respects.</li>\r\n<li>Entrants and Awardees may be invited to present at an

      Phase Are Provided Below:</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The competition will run through
      three phases. In the first, Solvers will be evaluated on their proposal (including
      any proposal to scale or grow existing initiatives) to deliver a relevant solution
      to a PMA-related challenge. The second phase will evaluate invited semi-finalists
      to share a more in-depth project plan and how this could be executed, as well
      as how this project supports a longer-term GEAR Center vision. In the third
      phase, finalists will be invited to present their proposals to a panel of Federal
      executives through 60-minute virtual meetings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In both phases
      requiring documents, entries must consist of PDF files with font size no smaller
      than 11-point Arial. All submissions must be in English. The participants must
      not use GSA&rsquo;s or OMB&rsquo;s logos or official seals in the submissions
      and must not otherwise give an appearance of Federal government endorsement.</p>\r\n<h5><strong>Phase
      I: Project Proposal, Opens May 2nd &ndash; Deadline to Submit by May 24th at
      5:00 PM EST</strong></h5>\r\n<p>Solvers submit a no more than two-page proposal
      (inclusive of any visual representations or graphics), plus the cover sheet
      specified below, providing the following information:</p>\r\n<p>Problem Statement:
      Describe the PMA-related challenge(s) that your project tackles and any relevant
      background information. Address the impact and innovation potential of your
      GEAR Center solution given the status quo.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Project Summary:
      What will your project do over a one year period? How does this align to the
      vision of the GEAR Center (as described on pp 112-114 of the PDF, <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/GovReform/Reform-and-Reorg-Plan-Final.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st
      Century: Reform Plan and Reorganization Recommendations</a>)?</li>\r\n<li>Anticipated
      Project Results: How can success be measured after one year? How can you use
      existing administrative data rather than new data collections? Who will ultimately
      benefit?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Ideal Team to Implement the Proposal: Describe
      the core team and partners or types of partners that would make for a successful
      project bringing diversity of industry, affiliation, geography, etc. (important:
      please write this in a way such that we can redact any organizational names
      for review).</li>\r\n<li>Resource Requirements: Describe what might be needed
      to implement your GEAR Center proposal (resources, stakeholder buy-in, other
      requirements, etc.). Address the feasibility of your idea. Note that the solution
      must be able to be delivered within current Federal operations and existing
      relationships - this award does not enable new Federal authorities or privileged
      access.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>During Phase I review process, the concept
      paper will be redacted for both applicant and any specific organizational partner
      names referenced (versus broader categories of organizational partners), and

description: "<p>The Federal government would benefit from better access to a well-integrated
  set of partners representing diverse industries and sectors to help resolve our
  toughest management problems. How can the government improve collaboration with
  leading private sector organizations, state and local governments, researchers,
  academic institutions, Federal government representatives, and the public? We cannot
  keep solving problems the same way and expect different results.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What
  is the GEAR Center?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>As described in the Delivering Government
  Solutions in the 21st Century reform plan, <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/GEARcenter/\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A Government Effectiveness Advanced Research
  (GEAR) Center</a> could bring together experts in disciplines ranging from economics,
  to computer science, to design thinking, in order to take a creative, data-driven,
  and interdisciplinary approach to new possibilities in how citizens and government
  interact. The GEAR Center can help government modernize to close the gap between
  government and private-sector services and capabilities. This may also lay the groundwork
  for where Federal operations and services need to be in five, 10, or 20 years.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What
  is the Challenge?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>This competition challenges \"Solvers\" (participating
  individuals, teams or legal entities) to demonstrate the usefulness of a GEAR Center
  model by describing how this model would tackle one or more of the major challenges
  facing government described in the current <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">President's Management Agenda</a> (PMA). For
  example, how should the government approach the introduction of artificial intelligence
  into operations? How can agencies more efficiently create a clearing house for matching
  government needs to relevant project ideas and researchers? Are there new ways to
  better connect diverse expertise across geographies with Federal agencies who can
  put that expertise to work in support of their missions? How can Federal agencies
  better prepare and recruit the Federal workforce?</p>\r\n<p>Before the government
  invests in a future GEAR Center, it is important to first explore the feasibility
  of creating these types of partnerships and if they can produce the kinds of quality
  approaches to problem solving the government needs. This competition is designed
  to reward the top models and execution strategies that will demonstrate a use case
  of a potential GEAR Center project by building on existing similar efforts.</p>\r\n<p>As
  a first step in formulating the vision for the GEAR Center, in December 2018, the
  interagency GEAR Team <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/GEARcenter/stakeholders/\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shared the results of the Request for Information</a>,
  in which over 40 entities submitted ideas for what a GEAR Center could be and how
  it might operate. Now, our goal is to recognize high-potential GEAR Center models
  by awarding prizes to those that can propose a workable GEAR Center model through
  a demonstration of how that model would creatively address one or more <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/PMA/Presidents_Management_Agenda.pdf\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PMA-related challenges</a> (pg. 4, 7-9).</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What
  is the Prize?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>GSA is offering up to three $300,000 cash prizes
  to the top solutions proposed, as well as selecting up to five additional winners
  for public recognition. We anticipate that each of the three cash awards will be
  for solutions that feasibly deliver results tackling different management challenges,
  but reserve the right to award up to three that propose solutions that address the
  same PMA-related challenge.</p>\r\n<p>Solvers may propose GEAR Center solutions
  that would:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Transform the way the Federal workforce is
  recruited, developed, reskilled or deployed.</li>\r\n<li>Empower external users
  to access and use Government data for commercial and other public purposes.</li>\r\n<li>Better
  connect Federal programs with a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the
  people they serve, and capture the voice of the customer in order to continuously
  improve Federal services.</li>\r\n<li>Solvers can suggest their own ideas to address
  issues described in the President's Management Agenda.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>On
  May 13, 2019 we hosted a webinar to answer questions</strong>&nbsp;and allow interested
  Solvers to connect with experts working on PMA challenges. The webinar was broadcast
  widely and is available online, along with answers to frequently asked questions:
