    rules: "<strong><u>Submission Requirements.</u></strong>  Each submission for
      this challenge requires a complete “Submission Package.” The submission package
      includes a 4-page written proposal describing an idea and 5-min video introducing
      the team (see requirements below). Both the idea and the Founders will be evaluated.
      \   In the proposal:  <ol>    <li>Describe your research idea that would further
      an understanding of neurobiology as it relates to SUD and that is intended to
      be the basis for a successful start-up. (1 page)</li>    <li>Convince the challenge
      reviewers of your technical competence as a biomedical scientist. Be brief,
      selective and persuasive. Do not use the NIH Bibliographic Sketch format. (0.5
      page)</li>    <li>Describe, in as many details as possible, what the prototype
      of your product would look like. Then, walk the Challenge reviewers through
      the typical use of the product, using simple terms and instructions. (1.5 pages)</li>
      \   <li>Explain the methods you will use (how, when, where, whom) to determine
      whether the product is needed by the target audience and whether that audience
      would be willing to pay for the product. (1 page)</li>  </ol>  The proposal
      must consist of a PDF file with at least 1-inch margins and no more than four
      (4) pages long. Font size must be no smaller than 11 point Arial. All submissions
      must be in English. The contestants must not use HHS’s logo or official seal
      or the logo of NIH or NIDA in the submissions, and must not claim federal government
      endorsement.  <ul>    <li>A brief video (link to YouTube) must be no longer
      than five (5) minutes. If the Challenge submission is from the team of Founders,
      the entire team must participate in the submitted video. In the YouTube video:
      \ <ul>    <li>Tell NIDA something, in one minute or less, that can illustrate
      the drive or the desire of each founder to develop a product that would further
      an understanding of neurobiology as it relates to SUD and that is intended to
      be the basis for a successful start-up.</li>    <li>Tell NIDA something about
      each founder that shows a high level of scientific and entrepreneurial ability.</li>
      \   <li>Tell NIDA something about each founder that shows a high level of perseverance
      and grit.</li>    <li>Tell NIDA about a time when your great idea was rejected.
      What was your response?</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  <strong><u>Rules for Participating
      in the Challenge.</u>  </strong>The Challenge is open to any Founder 18 years
      of age or older. No prior startup experience is necessary. A Founder may be
      (i) an entity or (ii) an individual or group of individuals (i.e., a team assembled

      States. However, non-U.S. citizens and non-permanent residents can participate
      as a member of a team that otherwise satisfies the eligibility criteria. Non-U.S.
      citizens and non-permanent residents are not eligible to win a monetary prize

  SUMMARY</strong>    Are you a biomedical scientist who believes that he/she has
  a research idea for a biotech start-up? This challenge is unique because the National
  Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) intends to fund the “would be” startup Founders much
  earlier than most investors, incubators, or traditional models of research funding
  (e.g. small business grants).    NIDA, one of the National Institutes of Health
  (NIH), announces the “2017: $100,000 for Start a SUD Startup” Challenge. The Challenge
  goal is to support research ideas that would further an understanding of neurobiology
  as it relates to Substance Use Disorders (SUD) and that are intended to be the basis
  for the development of a new and potentially successful start-up. NIDA hopes that
  participation in the contest will enable scientists to test the hypothesis that
  their research idea can be fostered into a biotech startup, and that eventually
  any newly created startups will contribute to the pool of innovative small business
  companies that can successfully compete for NIDA’s Small Business Innovation Research
  (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding.    <strong>The Challenge
  will offer up to ten awards of $10,000 each and provide mentorship support from
  NIDA entrepreneurship experts. </strong>The Challenge total purse is up to $100,000.    <strong>CHALLENGE
  DESCRIPTION</strong>    NIDA is excited to build upon the success of the 2016 Challenge
  “<a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/100000-for-start-a-sud-startup/">$100,000
  for Start a SUD Startup</a>” and is reissuing it in 2017. The challenge is a competition
  for biomedical scientists with the goal to support research ideas that would further
  an understanding of neurobiology as it relates to SUD and that are intended to be
  the basis for the development of a new and potentially successful start-up. NIDA
  hopes that participation in the contest will enable scientists to test whether their
  research ideas can be fostered into a biotech startup. The 2017 "$100,000 for Start
  a SUD Startup” Challenge will offer up to ten awards of $10,000 each and provide
  mentorship support from NIDA entrepreneurship experts.    What does it take to participate
  in the challenge? The team or an individual must have a research idea that could
  further the understanding of SUD and is intended to be the basis of the development
  of a new and potentially successful startup. The research “idea” is the product
  that your future startup will offer. Here, the term startup “product” is used in
  its broadest definition. Product is any source of value for the people who become
  customers. Services, subscriptions, software as a service (SaaS), physical/tangible
  products, aggregations, etc. could all provide value and thus be considered startup
  products. The startup product could be the result of novel scientific discoveries,
  repurposing an existing technology for a new use, extending a research observation
  or discovery made in a different scientific area into SUD, devising a new business
  model or distribution/delivery channel that unlocks new value, or simply bringing
  a product or service to an underserved customer. The Founder (the teams or an individual)
  must demonstrate through the Submission the passion, drive, discipline, ability
  to work collaboratively and willingness to push forward under conditions of extreme
  business uncertainty.    The winners of this challenge are encouraged to use the
  prize funds to develop a minimum viable proof (MVP) as quickly as possible and to
  obtain customer feedback to discover if MVP meets the customer needs. If the product
  prototype is successfully validated, winners are encouraged to create or further
  advance their biotech startup no later than 6 months after the prize is awarded.
  Post Challenge, as with all other NIH grant applicants, NIDA staff will provide
  dedicated assistance and guidance about the grant submission process, including
  how to submit an SBIR/STTR application to NIDA’s small business programs.    The
  research idea must be broad enough to address multiple conditions, diseases, or
  indications consistent with SUD or be specific for prevention and treatments of
  SUD. For example, if your idea can only work for cancer or diabetes, entering this
  challenge is not appropriate. However, if the plan is to test an idea for a research
  tool that would further an understanding of neurobiology or epigenetics relevant
  to SUD to progress faster and with greater fidelity, entering this challenge is
  appropriate.'
