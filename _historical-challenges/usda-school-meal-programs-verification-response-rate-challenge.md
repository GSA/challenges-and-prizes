      citizens and permanent legal residents age 18 and older at the time of registration,
      and private entities such as corporations and nonprofit organizations that are

      submit solutions through this site’s “Submit Solution” menu option between May
      4, (10:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time) and June 15, 2017 (2:00 p.m. EDT).    Individuals
      must log in to Challenge.gov to submit a solution or to comment on another’s
      solution.    Participants who are new to Challenge.gov will be prompted for
      the following registration information when they select “Submit Solution”:  <ul>    <li>Challenge.gov
      username (required)</li>    <li>first name (optional – but encouraged, to facilitate
      our open dialog on verification)</li>    <li>last name (optional)</li>    <li>interests
      and skill sets as a challenge participant (optional)</li>    <li>email address
      (required)</li>    <li>password for new Challenge.gov username (required)</li>  </ul>  Participants
      may submit their solutions as text, a combination of text and graphics, or video.
      Participants may supplement their solutions with supporting documents or exhibits
      such as a verification notice or reminder phone call script.    A submission
      consists of the following:  <ul>    <li><strong>Title</strong> – a title for
      the solution (required),</li>    <li><strong>Image / Logo</strong> – a logo
      for the solution (optional); a logo, such as a school district seal, may make
      it easier for participants to identify particular solutions,</li>    <li><strong>External
      URL</strong> – an external URL to the participant’s YouTube video solution (if
      applicable),</li>    <li><strong>Solution Files</strong> – supporting documents
      or exhibits pertinent to the solution (if applicable); these might include a
      verification notice, a reminder phone call script, a flowchart of the participant’s
      verification process, etc., and</li>    <li><strong>Description</strong> – the
      text of the solution (required).</li>  </ul>  Solutions must be reasonably brief.
      USDA will discard solutions that exceed the following limits. <em>Note, however,
      that these limits do not apply to supporting documents or exhibits such as a
      verification notice or reminder phone call script.</em>  <p style="padding-left:
      30px;"><strong>Text-only solutions:  </strong>500 words, inclusive of title,
      footnotes, endnotes, citations, and other references</p>  <p style="padding-left:
      30px;"><strong>Text with graphics:  </strong>500 words, inclusive of text contained
      in graphics, titles, footnotes, endnotes, citations, and references. Solutions
      containing graphics must be printable at full size on no more than two single-sided
      8 ½ x 11 inch sheets of paper with one inch margins</p>  <p style="padding-left:
      30px;"><strong>Video solutions:  </strong>2 ½ minutes of video posted to YouTube.
      Video solutions must be supplemented with a separate document of introductory
      text, not to exceed 500 words, and a full written transcript. The introductory
      text will accompany the video’s YouTube link on the challenge web site.</p>  Participants
      may submit as many solutions as they like.    <span style="color: #cc0000;"><strong>Public
      Comment and Dialog</strong></span>    USDA encourages participants and other
      visitors to the challenge website to review submitted solutions and offer their
      thoughts, observations, and suggestions for refinement. The comment and process
      offers all individuals an opportunity to contribute to a common dialog. Individuals
      need not submit their own solution to comment.    USDA will post solutions received
      from eligible participants after determining that they comply with the challenge’s
      Terms and Conditions. Once USDA posts a solution to the challenge website, participants
      and other visitors will be able to view and comment on that solution.    <span
      style="color: #cc0000;"><strong>Voting and Selection of “Popular Choice” Solution</strong></span>    At
      the close of the submission period on June 15, 2017, USDA will open up a one
      week voting period. Participants and other visitors to the challenge website
      may cast up to one vote for each solution, including their own. Individuals
      will vote by awarding up to 5 stars, with each star representing one point.    The
      solution that receives the highest average point rating from among the five
      solutions that receive the most votes will be recognized as the “Popular Choice”
      solution.    <span style="color: #cc0800;"><strong>Judging and Recognition</strong></span>    Solutions
      will be evaluated by USDA Food and Nutrition Service staff and the panel of
      judges named on the challenge website. USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service is
      solely responsible for the selection of judges.    Judging will take place in
      two rounds:  <ol>    <li>USDA Food and Nutrition Service staff will review all
      solutions and award points according to the Judging Criteria. The ten solutions
      with the most points will be selected as Round 1 finalists.</li>    <li>The
      panel of judges named on the challenge site will select solutions for recognition,
      based on the Judging Criteria, from Round 1 finalists.</li>  </ol>  USDA will
      select up to seven solutions for recognition based on the points awarded by
      the judges. In addition, one solution will be selected for recognition based
      on the votes cast by visitors to the challenge website.  <ul>    <li><strong>“Potential
      Game Changer”</strong> – Judges will select up to three solutions from the Round
      1 finalists for recognition as Potential Game Changers, the contest’s top award.</li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li><strong>“Popular
      Choice”</strong> – The solution that receives the highest average rating from
      among the five solutions with the greatest number of votes received will be
      recognized as the Popular Choice.</li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li><strong>“Best Documented”</strong>
      – Judges may select a solution from the Round 1 finalists with the strongest
      evidence in support of its impact on household response rates.</li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li><strong>“Honorable
      Mention”</strong> – Judges may select up to two solutions from the Round 1 finalists
      not recognized in another category for Honorable Mention based on the same criteria
      used to select the Potential Game Changers.</li>  </ul>  Participants must submit
      their solutions in English to be eligible for recognition by the challenge judges.    USDA
      will notify participants who are conditionally selected for recognition by email
      using the contact information provided at registration.    USDA will recognize
      all winning solutions on the challenge website and at USDA’s session on the
      verification process at the July 2017 School Nutrition Association Annual National
      Conference in Atlanta.    <span style="color: #cc0800;"><strong>Authority</strong></span>    15

  - judging-criteria-description-0: Judges will award up to 35 points for the strength
      of evidence provided in support of the solution’s impact on household response.
      Evidence might include documented changes in response rates after the district
      implemented its solution. Because response rates are so closely associated with
      sample size, an increase in household response in the absence of a reduction
      in sample size is the strongest evidence of effectiveness.

  - judging-criteria-description-1: Judges will award up to 35 points for solutions

      reveal new insight into the barriers to household response, and offer creative
      approaches to overcome those barriers, will receive the most points in this
      category.

description: '[embed]{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wp-content/2017/05/FNS-powtoon.mp4[/embed]    &nbsp;    <em>It’s
  late September, 2017.  School meal applications have slowed to a trickle and your
  office is switching gears to draw your verification sample.  You have high hopes
  that the plan you spent so much time refining over the summer will increase your
  household response rate: a re-designed verification selection notice, text message
  reminders, and that brilliant idea that Wanda came up with!  Surely one of those
  will make a difference...  You would feel just a little more confident if you knew
  that another school district had success with a similar strategy.</em>    <hr />    <span
  style="color: #cc0808;"><strong>Background</strong></span>    School districts approved
  almost five million household applications for free or reduced price school meal
  benefits last year.  Nearly nine million children from low income families were
  named on those applications. You know how vital the school meal programs are to
  the families in your district. But you also recognize the importance of the annual
  verification process.    Many school districts struggle with low verification response
  rates. Despite their best efforts some districts get barely half of their households
  to respond. For other districts a 50 percent response rate would be a big improvement.    But
  just as many districts have identified low-cost and creative strategies, often through
  trial and error, that allow them to consistently exceed 70, 80, or 90 percent response
  rates. In some cases those strategies are tailored to unique local circumstances
  and may not be practical anywhere else. But other strategies are more universal
  – sometimes a great idea is just a great idea.    <hr />    <span style="color:
  #cc0808;"><strong>The Challenge</strong></span>    The “Verification Response Rate
  Challenge” is a public forum for school district officials to exchange ideas on
  how to increase household response in the annual verification process. District
  staff can share their own verification success stories or they can build on others’
  submissions with constructive feedback and suggestions. Either way, the goal is
  to encourage dialog, refine ideas, and put great strategies to work.    Your contribution
  may help other school districts increase their verification response rates, reduce
  the time and expense associated with repeat follow-up reminders to households, and
  reduce the risk that eligible children lose access to program benefits.    The challenge
  is structured as a contest to maximize engagement and help uncover the most effective
  solutions. A panel of distinguished judges will review participant submissions on
  criteria that include proven success, cost effectiveness, practicality, and creativity.
  USDA will feature submissions recognized in several categories at this summer’s
  School Nutrition Association Annual National Conference in Atlanta.    &nbsp;'
