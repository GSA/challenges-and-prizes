description: "<p>The Office on Women&rsquo;s Health (OWH) is seeking new ways to get
  health messages out to women and girls. According to the CDC, two out of every three
  women in the United States are overweight or obese<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>1</sup></a>. This extra weight can lead
  to many diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and many cancers. Obesity results
  from a combination of causes and contributing factors, including individual factors
  such as behavior and genetics. Some examples of behaviors that affect weight include
  diet, physical activity, inactivity, and stress. Improving behaviors in these areas
  can help women and girls maintain a healthy weight.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, American
  children today are increasingly unhealthy at earlier ages. According to the 2014
  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), of girls ages 2-19, 16
  percent were overweight and 17.1 percent were obese<a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesity\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>2</sup></a>. Many children and teens do
  not eat properly or exercise enough and as a result, childhood obesity and diabetes
  are increasingly prevalent. Children with obesity may experience immediate health
  consequences that can lead to weight-related health problems in adulthood. In addition
  to physical health problems, overweight and obese children can be targets of social
  discrimination that can lead to low self-esteem and hinder social and academic functioning.</p>\r\n<p>Video
  games are a unique medium to boost knowledge and skills and can lead to behavior
  change through exploration of cause and effect in a virtual environment. According
  to a Robert Wood Johnson project called &ldquo;Health Games Research,&rdquo; it
  was found that digital games can be effective in improving children&rsquo;s health
  in multiple health topics including physical fitness, health promotion, and disease
  management<a href=\"http://healthgamesresearch.org/our-publications/research-briefs/Game-Changer\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>3</sup></a>. Additional evidence suggests
  adult learning and behavior change is also possible through gaming. A study in <em>JMIR
  Serious Games</em> found that women with a higher baseline readiness to change experienced
  improvement in BMI and nutrition with game play<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.2196/games.4977\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>4</sup></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Your
  challenge with this competition is to create an interactive video game with focus
  on obesity prevention or weight control for women or girls. The game you create
  will be shared with the general public. The game must address an evidence-based
  obesity prevention or control strategy. You must show that the game is unlike currently
  available offerings. The game must be made publically available at no cost as either
  a web-based or mobile based game available on a widely accessible platform.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For
  more information about obesity prevention or control strategies and guidelines view
  the CDC&rsquo;s resource here: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/resources/strategies-guidelines.html\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/resources/strategies-guidelines.html</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The
  competition has three phases. All eligible submissions will be evaluated and separate
  prizes will be awarded for each of the three phases.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dates:</strong>
  Submissions will be accepted starting January 31, 2019. The submission period for
  Phase 1 will end on March 31, 2019. The Phase 2 (In-Person Presentation) submission
  period will be on a date TBD in 2019. The prize winners will be announced at the
  completion of each phase.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Entries not in compliance with
  the submission requirements outlined below will be ineligible for further review
  and prize award. During the open submission period, participants must submit the
  following information to enter the Shape of Health competition:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Phase
  1 (Concept Development)&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>The first stage of the competition
  aims to attract a large range of ideas and game developers. The target submission
  of the first stage will be the conceptualization of the most promising and/or unique
  game to help support behavior change around physical activity and/or nutrition to
  prevent obesity in women or girls. The submissions should aim to demonstrate that
  the proposed game will be accessible to the general public, developed from evidence-based
  prevention or control techniques, and engaging for women or girls.</p>\r\n<p>The
  Phase 1 Submission shall include a comprehensive description of the proposed game
  in 5 pages or less, including:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>A one-paragraph executive summary
  that clearly states how the game will target obesity prevention or control determinants
  and be developed for a women or girls audience;</li>\r\n<li>Link evidence to support
  the obesity determinant chosen and the theoretical basis for the game (will your
  game change behavior? improve knowledge? something novel? etc.);</li>\r\n<li>A descriptive
  overview of how the participant arrived at their idea, and why the approach is unlike
  anything already available;</li>\r\n<li>A draft storyboard of the game that describes
  the game components; and</li>\r\n<li>An assessment describing the participant's
  ability to execute the proposed solution through Phase 2 and to completion.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Your
  Shape of Health competition concept submission must be uploaded on Challenge.gov.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Participants
  may also choose to include additional determinants that contribute to obesity not
  discussed in the provided resources.&nbsp; If additional determinants are included,
  the participant should include a short description of how these determinants may
  contribute to obesity and how this game will addresses these determinants.</p>\r\n<p>Up
  to 10 selections will be made in Phase 1 to continue on to Phase 2.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Phase
  2 (In-person Presentation)</strong></p>\r\n<p>Phase 2 of the competition builds
  upon the work of Phase 1 and is focused on prototyping the game, and providing an
  in-person presentation to a panel of judges. The participants should demonstrate
  both the evidence base for the intervention and its viability.</p>\r\n<p>The in-person
  presentation must include a description of how the following components are incorporated
  into the game:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Relates to women or girls;</li>\r\n<li>Targets
  a determinant of obesity; and</li>\r\n<li>Engages the player</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Selected
  participants must build out the storyboard submitted in Phase 1 to become a visual
  presentation of game play. The visual presentation of game play must be recorded
  into a video and available through a private YouTube link. OWH expects that the
  participants provide an in-person presentation, which includes a demonstration of
  the recorded presentation of game play.</p>\r\n<p>Submissions must be free of security
  threats and/or malware. Participants agree that HHS may conduct testing on the submission
  to determine whether malware or other security threats may be present. HHS may disqualify
  the submission if, in HHS&rsquo; judgment, the software may damage government or
  others&rsquo; equipment or operating environment or if the game, in HHS&rsquo; judgment,
  is inconsistent with HHS&rsquo; public health mission, utilizes software or other
  technologies without appropriate licenses, or any other reason deemed necessary.</p>\r\n<p>The
  expectation is that each team will use the prize money from Phase 1 for at least
  one person to travel to Washington, D.C. to deliver the in-person presentation.</p>\r\n<p>Up
  to 2 selections will be made in Phase 2 to continue on to Phase 3</p>\r\n<p><strong>Phase
  3 (final development)</strong></p>\r\n<p>Phase 3 builds upon the work of Phase 2
  and is focused on the final development of the proposed game and making it available
  to the general public. Entrants are required to ensure that proper obesity prevention
  or control determinants are included in the final game.&nbsp; Participants are encouraged
  to discuss the proper obesity prevention or control determinants with OWH in order
  to make sure that they are included in the final game.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Basis upon
  Which Winners Will Be Selected:</strong> A panel composed of subject-matter experts
  will judge eligible Shape of Health competition entries.&nbsp; The panel will make
  winner selections based upon the criteria outlined below and in compliance with
  the <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/idealab/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/HHS-COMPETITION-JUDGING-GUIDELINES.pdf\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HHS Competition Judging Guidelines</a>.</p>\r\n<p>One
  winner may be selected from each category (1 women&rsquo;s health and 1 girls&rsquo;
  health).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
