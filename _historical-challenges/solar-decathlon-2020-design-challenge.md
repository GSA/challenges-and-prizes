    how-to-enter: "<p><span lang=\"EN\">Teams that compete in the annual Solar Decathlon
      Design Challenge must create residential or commercial building designs over
      one or two semesters. Designs are evaluated on how well they meet the nation&rsquo;s
      rapidly evolving demand for buildings that are innovative, cost-effective, quick
      to build, high quality, resilient, grid interactive, efficient, and locally
      responsive.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Design Challenge teams choose
      to compete in one of six Divisions: </span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Suburban
      Single-Family </span></li>\r\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Urban Single-Family </span></li>\r\n<li><!--[endif]--><span

      lang=\"EN\">Office Building</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Teams
      may apply and begin projects as early as August of 2019. All teams that apply
      by the November 5, 2019, deadline are accepted to participate. For the Design
      Challenge application, each team: </span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span
      lang=\"EN\">Identifies a faculty or student team lead with a preliminary roster
      of student team members</span></li>\r\n<li><!--[endif]--><span lang=\"EN\">Selects
      the Division in which it intends to compete </span></li>\r\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Submits
      an optional five-page Project Introduction </span></li>\r\n<li><!--[endif]--><span
      lang=\"EN\">Pays a nonrefundable $100 application fee.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span
      lang=\"EN\">Participating teams are confirmed and announced by December. Each
      team submits a Project Progress Report the following February for evaluation.</span></p>\r\n<p><span
      lang=\"EN\">Up to 48 finalist teams, eight in each of six Divisions, are selected
      and invited to compete further with a final Project Report and Presentation
      of their design at the Design Challenge Weekend, held annually in April at the
      National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) main campus in Golden, Colorado.</span></p>\r\n<p><span
      lang=\"EN\">For this coming cycle, teams that apply by November 2019 and are
      selected to proceed after submitting their Project Progress Report in February
      2020 will be invited to complete their project in March and then present at
      the Design Challenge Weekend at NREL in April 2020.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Six
      winners&mdash;one from each Division&mdash;are determined by juried evaluation
      across all 10 Contests and awarded with trophies at the annual Design Challenge
      Weekend. A Design Challenge Grand Winner is also selected from the pool of six
      winners and provided with a special award.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Ready
      to learn more? Teams interested in participating in the Design Challenge should
      carefully review the complete set of entry requirements, available in the <a
