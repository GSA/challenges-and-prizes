  website, which opens on the date of launch.  </strong><strong>See official rules,
  terms and conditions on InnoCentive website.</strong>    The Bureau of Reclamation
  (Reclamation), the Seeker for this Challenge, plays a significant role in managing
  the Colorado River. Reclamation relies on a broad range of Colorado River Basin
  (CRB) data to support short-term water management and long-term planning, including
  data on historical, current, and projected weather and climate conditions, reservoir
  storage and releases, streamflows, and diversions. Reclamation is currently working
  to make CRB data more easily accessible to both Reclamation staff and non-Reclamation
  users such as other Federal, State, and local agencies, water users, recreationists,
  researchers, and other stakeholders    As Reclamation works to improve data access,
  better approaches to visualizing CRB data are needed to improve data exploration,
  analysis, interpretation, and communication by Reclamation and non-Reclamation users.
  In particular, better visualization approaches are needed to improve understanding
  and communication of current and projected conditions in the basin and the water
  management actions that affect those conditions.    Reclamation and its Collaborators
  seek innovative, interactive, and user-driven visualizations to improve understanding
  of past, present, and projected conditions in the CRB and to support analysis and
  decision making by Reclamation and non-Reclamation users.    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MQraxjryG0k"
