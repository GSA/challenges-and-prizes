### Description
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg .challenge-section}

<p><strong>All official entries must be submitted via the <a href="https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933764">InnoCentive website</a> open on the date of launch. </strong></p>
<p>Improved sub-seasonal forecasts for weather and climate conditions (lead-times ranging from 15 to 45 days and beyond) would allow water managers to better prepare for shifts in hydrologic regimes such as the onset of drought or occurrence of wet weather extremes. In response, Reclamation is launching this forecasting prize competition where solvers will submit sub-seasonal forecasts of temperature and precipitation for one year, competing in real-time against other teams as well as official forecasts from NOAA. Recognizing NOAA&rsquo;s leadership and role in forecasting, Reclamation has partnered with NOAA on this competition. To be eligible for prizes, solvers with skillful performance during the competition will be required to submit documentation of their forecast technique.</p>
