    "description": "<p>Our goals are to spur new, innovative thinking in radiation detection algorithms by engaging a broader community. For this competition, we have used radiation transport simulations to create thousands of data sets resembling typical radiological search data collected on urban streets in a mid-sized U.S. city. Each data set &ndash; called a run &ndash; simulates the detection events received by a standard thallium-doped sodium iodide detector driving along several city street blocks in a search vehicle. All of the runs contain data on radiation-detector interaction events from the natural background sources (roadway, sidewalks, and buildings), and some of the runs also contain data arising from non-natural extraneous radiation sources.&nbsp;Your task is to determine whether there&rsquo;s a source present on the street, and if so where and what kind it is.</p>",

While more capable, the new NVDs will be larger and heavier than currently fielded systems, raising concerns about helmet stability and comfort with current helmet retention systems. The Marine Corps wants to seek and recognize retention systems that may be compatible with the Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH) and that may provide greater stability, adjustability, and comfort. If the Marine Corps can find a retention system that constitutes outstanding achievements in basic, advanced, and applied research, technology development as well as prototype development in these areas, the Marine Corps will award a prize as detailed below and will consider procuring the system to retrofit ECHs either through a sole-source or competitive acquisition process.</p>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<h4><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h4>\r\n<p><strong>What&nbsp;is a retention system?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The retention system is the harness/chin&nbsp;strap that secures the helmet to one's head.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why do I have to request the drawings?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>We require a request for the&nbsp;drawings in order to verify Companies and individuals meet the Terms and&nbsp;Conditions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What color/material does the retention system have to be?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The color and&nbsp;design for this challenge is not restrictive. At the conclusion of the&nbsp;challenge we will discuss, with the winner, variations such as color.</p>\r\n<p><em>If you have additoinal questions, submit them <a href=\"https://www.marcorsyscom.marines.mil/Unit-Home/Marine-Equipping-Challenge/CHALLENGE-PM-ICE-Helmet-Retention-System/Question-Form/\">here</a>.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) gives notice of the availability of the Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s &ldquo;Opioid Detection Challenge&rdquo; prize competition and rules. As part of the comprehensive government effort to address the opioid crisis, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), along with the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) and the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), are seeking new tools and technologies to detect opioids in parcels moving through international service centers and express consignment facilities.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>The Opioid Crisis</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The Opioid Crisis: The abuse of opioids such as fentanyl has created an unprecedented public health crisis across the United States. In 2017, approximately 50,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses. International mail &mdash; through both USPS and express consignment &mdash; has been identified as a route for illicit opioids entering the U.S., commonly transported in nearly pure, powdered form. Consequently, large-scale drug trafficking can occur via very small packages sent in the mail.</p>\r\n<h5><strong>Seeking Solutions:</strong></h5>\r\n<p>The Challenge calls on innovators in a wide range of fields, from forensic science to industrial quality assurance to artificial intelligence, to help disrupt the flow of opioids into the United States by participating in this Challenge. The Challenge seeks novel, automated, nonintrusive, user-friendly and well developed plans for tools and technologies that have the potential to quickly and accurately detect opioids in parcels, without disrupting the flow of mail.</p>\r\n<p>The Opioid Detection Challenge, a multistage open innovation competition, will run from February 2019 through fall 2019 and award up to $1.55 million in cash prizes. Following the conclusion of the Challenge, the government expects to work with selected solvers to develop these prototypes into the next generation of opioid interdiction tools. The government plans to deploy these tools in international mail, express consignment facilities, and other environments across the country that call for rapid, accurate detection of opioids and related substances.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Stage 1: Up to eight (8) finalists will be selected to share a prize pool of $800,000 and advance to Stage 2.</li>\r\n<li>Stage 2: Finalists will compete for a prize pool of $750,000, to be shared by a grand prize winner and a runner-up.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>Challenge Phases (Overview)</strong></h3>\r\n<p><strong>Stage 1</strong></p>\r\n<p>In Stage 1, the Challenge seeks well developed plans for novel tools and technologies that can detect opioids in parcels in international mail. Solutions should be nonintrusive, accurate and intuitive, with the potential to screen packages quickly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Please note solutions should meet the following requirements:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Solutions cannot physically penetrate the parcel in any way</li>\r\n<li>Solutions cannot involve pretreating the parcels with powders, sprays, solutions or liquids</li>\r\n<li>Solutions must rely on information gleaned from the physical parcel, such as height, weight, appearance, handwriting, etc.; solutions may not rely on external data, such as information about the sender and recipient, that cannot be discerned from the package itself, or information from government or private/commercial databases</li>\r\n<li>Solutions must be moderate in size, no greater than 180&Prime; x 81&Prime; x 78&Prime;</li>\r\n<li>Solutions must be able to process parcels up to 27&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; in size</li>\r\n<li>Though not a requirement, solutions should ideally be able to process parcels up to 27\" x 21\" x 14\" in size</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Up to eight (8) finalists will be selected by the judges according to official Stage 1 selection criteria. Each finalist is expected to be awarded a share of the $800,000 prize pool. As part of their acceptance of the cash prize, finalists must agree to participate in Stage 2. At the conclusion of Stage 1, finalists will have the opportunity to add to their teams in order to maximize their likelihood of success through Stage 2, when teams will be developing their prototypes. In order to facilitate this, Stage 1 participants will be given the opportunity to share their contact information and submission abstracts, to be made available to finalists.</p>\r\n<p>If any potential finalist is found to be ineligible, has not complied with the Official Rules, Terms and Conditions, or declines the cash prize for any reason prior to award, an alternate finalist may be selected. DHS and its partnering agencies may consider awarding nonmonetary recognition(s) to any submission(s) which are of high interest to the government, but not selected as finalists.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong></p>\r\n<p>In Stage 2, Finalists will participate in a 14-week prototyping accelerator, where they will develop their plans into testable prototypes. During this time, finalists will receive additional support, including access to mentors, guidance from government experts, educational webinars, access to additional datasets and/or information on current processes. We anticipate holding several webinars featuring guidance and open question periods with government and other experts. Training dataset(s) will be made available to finalists as required by the solution type.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Stage 2 will culminate in a mandatory live test event, where finalists will convene at a government selected facility for on-site testing of their prototypes. A standard testing approach will be applied to all solutions. DHS will provide a set of articles on which the solutions will be tested. Test results will be a factor in determining the Stage 2 winners, but not the sole basis for selection. Test event participants will be responsible for arranging their own travel and accommodation, paid for using their Stage 1 prize award. Additional details regarding testing will be provided at the start of the prototyping accelerator.</p>\r\n<p>During Stage 2, finalists from Stage 1 will compete for $750,000 in additional cash prizes. The grand prize winner is expected to be awarded $500,000, and the runner-up to be awarded $250,000. The cash prizes in Stage 2 will be distributed based on the review of the Stage 2 submissions by the judges according to the Stage 2 selection criteria, which will be shared at a later date. Please refer to the Official Rules, Terms and Conditions for further details.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, if the government determines that the entire project has been successfully completed, there continues to be a need, and there is available funding; You and DHS or any DHS component, or USPIS may attempt to negotiate one or more new agreements for the following purposes as authorized by law:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>An agreement with USPIS &nbsp;under applicable USPS authorities as determined by USPIS</li>\r\n<li>Follow On prototype R&amp;D contract, Cooperative Research and Development Agreement,&nbsp; or Other Transactions Agreement as authorized by law and applicable DHS or DHS component policy.</li>\r\n<li>Follow On agreement for limited use of one or more completed prototypes in the DHS environment for test purposes for a minimum of up to one year; as authorized by applicable law and DHS or DHS component policy.</li>\r\n<li>A Follow-On production purchase agreement in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, FAR 6.204, or as otherwise authorized by applicable law and DHS or DHS component policy.</li>\r\n</ul>",

Long-term streamflow records, for example, are critical to the design of water supply and flood control projects, as well as infrastructure in and adjacent to stream channels. Similarly, water managers rely on real-time streamflow data to support water supply and flood control operations, including forecast and early warning systems for droughts and floods. Long-term and real-time streamflow data also support a broad range of water resources and environmental research. <br /><br />Despite the importance of streamflow data, the existing network of continuous streamflow monitoring stations (also referred to as stream gages) in the United States has generally declined over the past several decades. The number of stream gages operated by the US Geological Survey peaked in the late 1960s and declined nearly 20% by the late 1990s. The primary driver of this decline is the cost of installing, operating, and maintaining stream gages. Between 2000 and 2009, additional funding was made available to reactivate approximately half of the deactivated gages; however, the cost of installing, operating, and maintaining stream gages remains a significant challenge to Federal, Tribal, State, and local water agencies.<br /><br />This prize competition seeks new methods or technologies to significantly reduce the equipment and/or labor costs of continuous streamflow monitoring. Methods must be applicable to continuous monitoring of the volumetric flow rate of water in open channels, including natural channels (e.g., streams and rivers) and engineered channels (e.g., aqueducts, canals, and drainage channels). Methods should be applicable across wide range of flow rates, channel sizes, and channel geometries, and the accuracy and reliability of methods should be comparable or better than current methods.<br /><br />A brief video describing this Challenge can be found <a href=\"https://www.usbr.gov/research/challenges/streamflow.html\">here</a>.<br /><!--[endif]--></span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Challenge is set to launch Friday, February 22, 2019, 12:00 PM ET.&nbsp; Submissions will be accepted for 45 days (concludes April 8, 2019 at 11:59 PM ET).</span></p>",

Testing will focus on verifying that the prototype system functions as intended and provides accurate measurements under controlled conditions.&nbsp; A possible Stage 3 challenge would also be a reduction-to-practice challenge seeking the development of prototype systems to be tested in the field.

    "description": "<p><span lang=\"EN\">The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with the Department of Energy&rsquo;s Water Power Technologies Office, U.S. Geological Survey, NOAA Fisheries, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, State of Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, are seeking innovative methods for excluding fish from water diversions and intakes. While effective fish exclusion for some fish species and life history stages can be achieved, improvements are needed to increase effectiveness and decrease the costs associated with fish exclusion devices.&nbsp; Proposed solutions can include new ideas for addressing fish exclusion or improvements to existing technologies. Solutions can be applied to river and canal diversions, unscreened diversion pipes, or intakes at dams.&nbsp; The prize purse for this challenge is $75,000.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Fish exclusion is a way of preventing movement of fish into a water diversion or intake. Without a fish exclusion device or method, fish can be entrained into the diversion or intake which means that they are removed from their natural environment. This can result in the loss of native fishes and reduced operating capabilities of the involved infrastructure. Opportunities to reduce entrainment at diversions and intakes will promote more sustainable and reliable water resource systems that can provide greater benefits for aquatic species and the public. While effective fish exclusion for some fish species and life history stages can be achieved, improvements are needed to increase fish protection efficiencies, target a wider range of fish species and sizes, and reduce construction, operation, and maintenance costs compared to conventional fish exclusion methods.&nbsp; <br /><br />Proposed solutions can include new ideas for addressing fish exclusion or improvements to existing technologies. Solutions can be applied to river and canal diversions, unscreened diversion pipes, or intakes at dams (e.g. turbine intakes or water regulation). Submissions that address fish exclusion for one or more species of concern in the United States (e.g. salmon, steelhead, sturgeon [green, pallid, shovelnose] and paddlefish, eel, lamprey [Pacific, brook, and river], Delta smelt, shad, suckers, river herring [alewife, blueback herring], bull trout) will be accepted.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A brief video describing this Challenge can be found <a href=\"https://www.usbr.gov/research/challenges/fishexclusion.html\">here</a>.<br /><!--[endif]--></span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Challenge Is set to launch Wednesday, March 6, 2019, 12:00 pm ET.&nbsp; Submissions will be accepted until 11:59 PM ET on May 6, 2019.&nbsp; Late submissions will not be accepted.</span></p>",

    "description": "<p>The Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation Competition, ARIAC, addresses a critical limitation of robots used in industrial environments like factory floors: They are not as agile as they need to be.</p>\r\n<p>Many robots are not able to quickly detect failures or recover from those failures. They aren't able to sense changes in their environment and modify their actions accordingly. Programming these robots for even the simplest tasks takes time and effort. Help solve this problem by coding your own robot control system (software) that can outperform everyone else's in a simulated environment! Compete to win $17,500 in cash prizes and the opportunity to showcase your solution at a future robotics conference.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Background</strong></h4>\r\n<p>In June 2017, the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) put on the first ARIAC Competition. The goal of the competition was to test the agility of industrial robot systems, with the goal of enabling industrial robots on the shop floors to be more productive, more autonomous, and to require less time from shop floor workers. For the second year of the competition, we introduced a cash prize to motivate and expand participation. This is the third year of the competition.</p>\r\n<p>In this context, agility is defined broadly to address:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Failure identification and recovery, where robots can detect failures in a manufacturing process and automatically recover from those failures</li>\r\n<li>Automated planning, to minimize (or eliminate) the up-front robot programming time when a new task is introduced</li>\r\n<li>Fixtureless environment, where robots can sense the environment and perform tasks on parts that are not in predefined locations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Participants are required to develop a robot control system (software) to control a robot in a simulated environment. Gazebo (<a href=\"http://www.gazebosim.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.gazebosim.com</a>), which is an open source robotics simulation environment, will be used as the testing platform and the Robot Operating Systems (ROS), which is an open source set of software libraries and tools, will be used to define the interfaces to the simulation system.</p>\r\n<p>Software interfaces will be made publicly available that will allow the Participants to control the robot. There will be one qualifier in the April 2019 timeframe with the final competition occurring in mid-May 2019. The competition will be performed virtually in the cloud, so physical attendance is not required to compete. NIST is proposing a workshop to a major robotics conference to allow the winning Participants to present their approaches; details, when available, will be posted to the official challenge website. See full details in <em><strong>How to Enter.</strong></em></p>\r\n<h4><strong>Dates of the Competition</strong></h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Qualifier Begin: April 15, 2019</li>\r\n<li>Qualifier End: April 19, 2019</li>\r\n<li>Competition Testing (Finals) Period Begins: May 13, 2019</li>\r\n<li>Competition Testing (Finals) Period Ends: 5:00 PM, May 17, 2019</li>\r\n<li>Announcement of Cash Prize Winners: May 21, 2019</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><strong>Competition Scenarios</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The following terminology is frequently used in this document</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Order: A list of parts and their goal location on a tray.</li>\r\n<li>Part: One element of an order.</li>\r\n<li>Tray: A surface that hold parts.</li>\r\n<li>Kit: A tray and set of parts that make up an order.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>ARIAC requires participants to complete a series of tests centered in an industrial scenario that are based around building kits made up of particular parts. The robot system will work within the environment specified in the work environment section.</p>\r\n<p>There are three different test scenarios that all involve moving parts from a supply location to a tray. The possible supply locations are a conveyor belt, and stationary bins. Challenges will be introduced in each scenario. Details about the scenarios follow.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Scenario 1:</strong>&nbsp;Baseline Kit Building: The first scenario is intended as a baseline set of tasks for the other test methods to be compared against. The task for this scenario is to pick specific parts and place them on a tray. The robot arms will receive an &ldquo;Order&rdquo; that details the list of parts and their target locations. Orders are covered in more detail in the Orders section.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Scenario 2:</strong>&nbsp;Dropped Part: The task for Scenario 2 is identical to Scenario 1, however one or more parts will drop from the robots&rsquo; gripper. The robots will need to recover after dropping a part and complete the given Order. Recovery could entail picking up the dropped part or fetching a new part.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Scenario 3:</strong>&nbsp;In-Process Kit Change: While the robots are in the middle of assembling a kit, a new high priority order will be received that needs to be completed as fast as possible. The robots will need to decide how best to complete this new order, and then complete the previous order.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The competition will consist of 15 trials: 5 trials of each of the 3 scenarios. Each trial will receive a score based on completion and efficiency metrics outlined in the Scoring section.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Winners</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Up to three winners will be selected. The Prize Purse for the ARIAC Prize Competition is a total of $17,500. In addition, each winner may be able to select any one representative from their team to present their results at a robotics conference in 2019 in a workshop dedicated to the ARIAC competition. NIST may be able to provide travel funds subject to availability.&nbsp; The number of winners will be fewer than three if there are fewer than three Participants that qualify for the competition. The Prize Purse may increase, but will not decrease. Any increases in the Prize Purse will be posted on the Event Website. NIST reserves the right to announce additional winners of non-cash prizes.</p>",

The event website is: <a href=\"http://www.nist.gov/ariac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.nist.gov/ariac</a>.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Eligibility to Participate&nbsp;</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Participation in the ARIAC Prize Competition is open to ALL; however, not all participants are eligible to win cash prizes as explained in the next section.</p>\r\n<p>Each Competition Participant (individual, team, or legal entity) is required to register on the ARIAC website. There shall be one Official Representative for each Competition Participant. The Official Representative must provide a name, username (which may serve as a team or affiliation name), email address, and affirm that he/she has read and consents to be governed by the Competition Rules. Multiple registrations per Participant are NOT allowed. At NIST&rsquo;s discretion, any violation of this rule will be grounds for disqualification from the Competition. Multiple individuals and/or legal entities may collaborate as a team to submit a single entry (Participant&rsquo;s code submission to a qualifier or final), in which case the designated Official Representative will be responsible for meeting all entry and evaluation requirements. Participation is subject to all U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. Participants must not be suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded from doing business with the Federal Government. Individuals entering on behalf of or representing a company, institution or other legal entity are responsible for confirming that their entry does not violate any policies of that company, institution or legal entity. Any other individuals or legal entities involved with the design, production, execution, distribution or evaluation of ARIAC are not eligible to participate.</p>\r\n<p>Once registered, Participants will have access to the interfaces needed to participate in the competition through the ARIAC website. NIST will create an account to allow the Participants to upload their submissions to the qualifier. Modifications and improvements to a Participant&rsquo;s control system during the qualifying period are to be expected, but the Participant should have one final control system ready for the final competition.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Elibility to Win a Cash Prize</strong></h4>\r\n<p>To be eligible for a cash prize:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A Participant (whether an individual, team, or legal entity) must have registered to participate and complied with all of the requirements under section 3719 of title 15, United States Code as contained herein.</li>\r\n<li>At the time of Entry, the Official Representative (individual or team lead, in the case of a group project) must be age 18 or older and a U.S. citizen or permanent resident of the United States or its territories.</li>\r\n<li>In the case of a private entity, the business shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States or its territories.</li>\r\n<li>Participants may not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment. NIST employees are not eligible to participate. Non-NIST Federal employees acting in their personal capacities should consult with their respective agency ethics officials to determine whether their participation in this Competition is permissible.</li>\r\n<li>A Participant shall not be deemed ineligible because the Participant consulted with Federal employees or used Federal facilities in preparing its submission to the ARIAC Prize Competition if the Federal employees and facilities are made available to all Participants on an equitable basis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, interested Participants who do not meet the eligibility requirements to win a prize (i.e., individuals who are neither a US citizen nor a permanent resident of the United States or non-US-based entities) are encouraged to participate in the Competition. They are invited to register on the ARIAC website and download the training material. The performance obtained by these Participants will be displayed on the ARIAC website in the same manner as the performance obtained by Participants who are eligible to win cash prizes.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Judging Panel</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The NIST Director will appoint a panel of three qualified judges. The Judges will be robot agility and/or simulation experts from inside and/or outside of NIST. The Judges will determine winners according to the Judging Criteria described herein. The Judges may not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of, any entity that is a registered Participant in the Competition and may not have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a registered Participant. In the event of such a conflict, a Judge must recuse himself or herself and a new Judge may be appointed.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Basis on which Finalists and Winners Will Be Selected</strong></h4>\r\n<p>A portion of the scores will be automatically calculated, shared with the Participants, and publicly posted for each Trial at the conclusion of the Finals (after all Trials are run) as a combination of cost and performance metrics, described below in the Trial Score Calculation section. A Participant&rsquo;s final automated score is the sum of scores for each of the 15 competition Trials.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Environment</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The simulation environment is a representation of an industrial kitting work cell with two robot arms, a conveyor belt, part bins, and trays.</p>\r\n<p>The conveyor belt is a 1 m wide plane that transports objects across the work environment at a fixed speed of roughly 0.2 m/s. Parts continuously appear on the belt for the duration of the trial. When parts reach the end of the conveyor belt they are automatically removed. Teams can control the conveyor belt during development, but not during the final competition.</p>\r\n<p>There are eight part bins that may be used for building kits. Parts in these bins will not be replaced once used.</p>\r\n<p>There are two robot arms mounted on a linear actuator that operates parallel to the conveyor belt. The linear actuator measures 4 m.</p>\r\n<p>Two automated guided vehicles (AGV) are located at either end of the linear actuator. Kits are built on top of these AGVs. A team will programmatically signal the AGVs when the kits are ready to be taken away. The signaled AGV will depart for a short period and then return with an empty tray.</p>\r\n<p>The trays used for assembling kits are flat trays measuring 0.5 x 0.7 m.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Robot Arm</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The two robot arms used in each trial will be Universal Robots UR10.</p>\r\n<p>The robot arms&rsquo; position is controlled through the linear actuator on which it is mounted.</p>\r\n<p>The end of the arms are equipped with a vacuum gripper. The vacuum gripper is controlled in a binary manner and reports whether or not it is successfully gripping an object.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Sensors</strong></h4>\r\n<p>A team can place sensors around the environment. Each sensor has a cost that factors into the final score. Available sensors are:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Break beam: reports when a beam is broken by an object. It does not provide distance information.</li>\r\n<li>Laser scanner: provides an array of distances to a sensed object.</li>\r\n<li>Cognex logical camera: provides information about the pose and type of all models within its field of view.</li>\r\n<li>Proximity: detects the range to an object.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4><strong>Order</strong></h4>\r\n<p>An order is an instruction containing kits for the robot system to complete. Each order will specify the kit to be assembled, i.e. the list of parts to be put in the kit. Each specified part has the following structure:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The type of part.</li>\r\n<li>The position and orientation of the part on the tray.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4><strong>Faulty parts</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Above each AGV is a quality control sensor that detects faulty parts. If faulty parts are detected while teams are filling trays, those parts should be removed from the tray and replaced with another part of the same type. Faulty parts are considered unwanted parts: they will not count for any points when the kit is submitted, and they will cost teams the all-parts bonus if left in trays.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Scoring</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Scores will be automatically calculated for each trial as a combination of performance metrics and costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Competition Process</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Each trial will consist of the following steps:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The robots programmatically signal that they are able to begin accepting orders.</li>\r\n<li>The first Order (Order 1) is sent to the robots.</li>\r\n<li>A fixed amount of time is allowed to complete the order.</li>\r\n<li>In the case of the Dropped Part testing method, up to three parts will be forcibly dropped from the gripper.</li>\r\n<li>In the case of the In-Process Kit Change testing method, a new Order (Order 2) will be issued that is of higher priority than the previously issued Order 1. When Order 2 is complete, building of Order 1 is to resume.</li>\r\n<li>The robots signal programmatically when a kit is complete and ready for quality control.</li>\r\n<li>The robot system will be notified that the trial is over. The trial is over when time runs out or all Orders have been fulfilled.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4><strong>Cost Metrics</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The following values are calculated for a Participant&rsquo;s system setup. As Participants are to use the same system setup for all Trials, the values will remain unchanged between Trials.</p>\r\n<p>The choices made by the competitors (choices of sensors) will have a specific cost associated with them. The final cost for individual sensors will be made available to the Participants at least two weeks before the Finals. For planning purposes, Participants should use:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>$500 for each logical camera used.</li>\r\n<li>$200 for each depth camera used.</li>\r\n<li>$100 for each other sensor used (e.g., break beam, proximity, laser scanner).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The sum of these cost choices made by each team will be divided by a baseline cost of $1700 and made into a cost factor for the scoring. The team costs are designated as TC, and the baseline cost is designated as BC. The cost factor, is then calculated as:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/community-library/1043/ARIAC-Cost-Metrics.png\" width=\"150\" /></p>\r\n<h4><strong>Completion Score</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Performance metrics that cover both completion and efficiency are calculated for each Trial separately. Completion captures the quality of the orders fulfilled (that the boxes contain the correct products in the correct position/orientations); efficiency captures the responsiveness in fulfilling orders (that the orders were filled quickly).</p>\r\n<p>Each trial, since it has the option to have more than one order, will have a certain set of scores for each order. Each order consists of a list of products needed and a prescribed position and orientation for each product within the box. The completion score, CS, is a combined score for each order, starting with 1 point for each product that is placed in the box. For each product that is within 3 cm of the correct position, and within 0.1 radians of the correct orientation will result in an additional point. Next, since the main focus of the competition is to have fulfilled orders, any order with all of the products in the confines of the box and in the correct position/orientation receives an additional point for each product. So, for an order sj with i products in it would have a maximum score of:</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/community-library/1043/ARIAC-Completion-Score.png\" width=\"150\" /></p>\r\n<h4><strong>Efficiency Factor</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The Efficiency of the approaches chosen by the teams are accounted for in the scoring by using the times that each team takes to complete each trial. The times are counted in seconds from the start of the trial until the first kit is completed and is designated as T01. In the trials with multiple orders, the time, Tj is counted in seconds from the time that the jth order is sent to the team. For each trial, an average of the times for each team (ATj) is compared to the individual team time to calculate the Efficiency Factor:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If a team&rsquo;s system times out for a trial, the efficiency factor for the trial is set to 0 and the trial time is not used to calculate the average times for that trial.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For the multi-order trials where one of the orders is a high priority order, an additional multiplier, h, is applied with the efficiency factor to give a higher proportion of the score to that order, which is initially set to a value of 3. The final h value will be made available to the Participants at least two weeks before the finals.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/community-library/1043/ARIAC-Efficiency-Factor.png\" width=\"200\" /></p>\r\n<h4><strong>Trial Score Calculation</strong></h4>\r\n<p>All of the scoring factors described above are combined as shown below to calculate the score for each trial:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/community-library/1043/ARIAC-Trial-Score-Calculation.png\" width=\"600\" /></p>\r\n<h4><strong>Final Score Calculation</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The final overall score is the equally weighted sum of all trial scores. As mentioned in the Competition Scenarios section, trials are expected to focus on the Baseline Kit Building, Dropped Part, and In-Process Kit Change scenarios, among others.</p>\r\n<p>The Winners of cash prizes will be determined by three Judges appointed by the NIST Director, using the Judging Criteria outlined herein.</p>\r\n<p>NIST will announce the Finalists via the Event Website as well as those Finalists that have been awarded a cash award (each, an &ldquo;Award&rdquo;). The anticipated number and amount of the Awards that will be awarded for this Competition is set forth in these rules; however, NIST is not obligated to make all or any Awards, and reserves the right to award fewer than the anticipated number of Awards in the event an insufficient number of eligible Participants meet any one or more of the Judging Criteria for this Competition, based on NIST&rsquo;s sole discretion. Using the Judging Criteria described herein, three qualified Judges (appointed by the NIST Director) will determine the winners of the ARIAC Prize Competition.</p>\r\n<p>The winner verification process for being eligible to receive an Award includes providing the full legal name, tax identification number or social security number, routing number and banking account to which the prize money can be deposited directly. Return of any notification as &ldquo;undeliverable&rdquo; will result in disqualification. The verification form must be returned within seven (7) calendar days of receipt. After verification of eligibility, Awards will be distributed in the form of electronic funds transfer addressed to the Official Representatives specified in the winning Entries. That Official Representative will have sole responsibility for further distribution of any Award among Participants in a group Entry or within a company or institution that has submitted an Entry through that representative.

    "description": "<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">What is the World Magnetic Model?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Earth is a giant magnet. Compasses &mdash; both digital and analog &mdash; are oriented by the magnetic force at a user&rsquo;s location. Since geographic and magnetic poles do not align, geomagnetic models like the World Magnetic Model (WMM) correct for this difference.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field is constantly changing, the difference between geographic and magnetic north also changes, and the WMM must be regularly updated.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">An opportunity to rethink geomagnetic data collection</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Production of the WMM currently uses space-based magnetic field measurements that the European Space Agency (ESA) Swarm mission has provided since 2013. Swarm mission satellites contain several instruments capable of producing a variety of measurements, including magnetic vector field measurements. To ensure sustainability of the WMM, the U.S. government is taking a proactive approach to identifying new methods of data collection independent of Swarm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">The World Magnetic Model is used every day around the world</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The WMM is embedded in thousands of systems. More than a billion smartphone users depend on the WMM to point them in the right direction when they use mobile navigation apps. Drivers rely on the WMM to power the compasses in their cars. The WMM is also critical for military and commercial uses around the world. Among other applications, it supports navigation and attitude determination for submarines, satellites, and aircraft, while also informing operational logistics like the numbering of runways.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">MagQuest, a multiphase open innovation challenge</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) calls upon solvers to submit novel approaches to geomagnetic data collection for the World Magnetic Model. This open innovation challenge is designed to attract new ideas to increase the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of geomagnetic data collection. With MagQuest, NGA aims to inspire domestic and international solvers to apply their expertise to spaceborne, aerial, terrestrial, and other potential solution areas. Solvers from small businesses, academic institutions, labs, startups, and other organizations are encouraged to enter the competition. (See Additional Resources for an overview of potential solution areas.)</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Challenge Phases (Overview)</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">MagQuest Phases 1-2 (March 2019 through September 2019) will award a total of $1.2 million.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span lang=\"EN\">Phase 1</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Phase 1 will be open to all eligible solvers. In Phase 1:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">The challenge seeks concepts that propose novel methods or technologies that may be promising to provide sufficient data for the WMM.</span></li>\r\n<li>Submissions open March 21, 2019 and close May 16, 2019.</li>\r\n<li>Up to ten (10) winners will be selected by the judges according to official Phase 1 selection criteria. The total Phase 1 prize pool of $200,000 will be distributed evenly across Phase 1 winners.</li>\r\n<li>As part of their acceptance of the associated Phase 1 monetary prize, winners agree to have a brief synopsis of their concept published on the MagQuest website.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em><span lang=\"EN\">Phase 2</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Phase 2 will be open to solvers from Phase 1, as well as new solvers who did not participate in the first phase of the challenge. Success in Phase 2 may require increased expertise, and participants will have an opportunity to form expanded teams. More information on potential team collaboration will be provided at the outset of Phase 2.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In Phase 2:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">The challenge will seek detailed designs and plans for data collection methodologies, including descriptions, 3D models, and hypotheses for prototype development and testing.</span></li>\r\n<li>Submissions are expected to open June 2019 and close August 2019.</li>\r\n<li>Up to five (5) winners will be selected by the judges according to official Phase 2 selection criteria. The total Phase 2 prize pool of $1 million will be distributed across Phase 2 winners.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">To learn more and view helpful informational resources, visit </span><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"http://www.magquest.com/additional-resources/\">http://www.magquest.com/additional-resources</a></span></p>",

Up to $425,000 will be awarded to winning teams that create haptic interface prototypes that could improve public safety operations.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Public safety officials perform tasks in a variety of environments that severely limit their senses and ability to communicate. </span><span lang=\"EN\">This </span><span lang=\"EN\">challenge seeks to investigate the relevance of haptic interfaces assisting in first responder tasks</span><span lang=\"EN\">, such as monitoring patient vitals, navigating complex spaces with limited visibility, or maintaining situational awareness. </span><span lang=\"EN\">The challenge consists of multiple phases and will require contestants to develop three haptic interface prototypes to be integrated into PSCR-provided virtual reality scenarios as well as a final haptic prototype embedded into firefighter PPE for use in a search and rescue task.</span><span lang=\"EN\"> Contestants will also have the opportunity to demo their initial prototypes with first responders at <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/2019-public-safety-broadband-stakeholder-meeting\">the 2019 Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder Meeting</a> in Chicago, IL.PSCR will assess the efficiency, effectiveness, and level of user satisfaction of the haptic interface prototypes and their ability to assist first responders in conducting their tasks. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The challenge launches March 18, 2019, and concept paper submissions are due April 22, 2019.</span></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Challenge Background &amp; Goals</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">One goal of the challenge is to assess the potential of using virtual reality as a development tool to prototype and iterate on designs for public safety technology. Contestants will have the opportunity to enhance their prototypes after interacting with public safety stakeholders and receiving feedback on their designs. </span><span lang=\"EN\">This challenge also seeks to convene members of the haptic provider community and innovators in the development community to advance the state of haptic interfaces for public safety. </span><span lang=\"EN\">PSCR will keep the prototypes for future public safety demonstrations. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Since 2002, <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr\">PSCR</a> has collaborated with first responders, stakeholders, and innovators to ensure the development of reliable, intuitive, and mission-focused technologies for the public safety community.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In 2018, PSCR launched their first challenge in the User Interface / User Experience (UI/UX) series focused on advancing interfaces that allow a public safety user to effectively interact with and obtain information from the technology system(s) while ensuring the device is designed around public safety&rsquo;s operational needs. In 2018, PSCR named 6 winners in the Virtual Reality Heads-Up Display Navigation Challenge. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The contestants, consisting of <strong>Haptic Providers</strong> and <strong>Haptic Development Teams</strong>, and their haptic interface prototypes will be evaluated in two key areas: </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">1) How the prototypes impact a first responder&rsquo;s performance in three virtual reality (VR) scenarios [law enforcement, emergency medical services (EMS), and fire service] and </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">2) How, once embedded into firefighter personal protective equipment (PPE), the prototypes assist firefighters in a realistic scenario as they navigate and conduct a search and rescue task at a firefighter training facility.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The challenge consists of multiple phases and will require contestants to develop three haptic interface prototypes to be integrated into PSCR-provided virtual reality scenarios as well as a final haptic prototype embedded into firefighter PPE for use in a search and rescue task. After the completion of this challenge, PSCR will keep the submitted prototypes from Phase 4 and Phase 5 for future public safety demonstrations. Contestants are encouraged to develop multiple sets of prototypes throughout the challenge, in anticipation of this PSCR keeping the prototypes for demonstrations, and in case the contestants experience technical difficulties during later phases of the challenge.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span lang=\"EN\"><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"/community-library/1043/PSCR_HapticInterfacesforPublicSafetyChallenge_OfficialRules.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">View the a complete summary of contest phases and key dates</a>.</span></span></strong></p>",
