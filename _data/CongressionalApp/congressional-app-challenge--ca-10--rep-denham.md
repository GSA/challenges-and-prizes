  can contact you with updates about the Challenge.</strong>    &nbsp;    The Congressional
  App Challenge is a competition aimed at encouraging U.S. high school students to
  learn how to code by creating their own applications. The Challenge is intended
  to highlight the value of computer science and STEM education (Science, Technology,
  Engineering and Math).    The House of Representatives knows how crucial these skills
  are and wants to encourage students to engage in these fields. By encouraging and
  recognizing our nation’s young programming talent, Congress hopes to shine a light
  on the growing importance of these skills.    Please note that this competition
  is open to all<em> </em>students, regardless of coding experience. We strongly encourage
  students of <em>all</em> skill levels to participate, to learn how to create their
  own apps.    &nbsp;'
