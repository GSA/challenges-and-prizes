# Federalist + U.S. Web Design System + Jekyll

This [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) is developed using the [U.S. Web Design System v 2.0](https://v2.designsystem.digital.gov) and is focused on providing developers a starter kit and reference implementation Federalist websites.

This code uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site engine and built with Ruby. If you prefer to use Javascript, check out [federalist-uswds-gatsby](https://github.com/18F/federalist-uswds-gatsby), which uses [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) site engine.

This project assumes that you are comfortable editing source code. If you prefer to launch a website without editing any source code, checkout [uswds-jekyll](https://github.com/18F/uswds-jekyll), which allows you to change the layout and content with a few configuration options.



**WARNING** This is a pre-1.0 code. You can keep track of progress here: https://github.com/18F/federalist-uswds-jekyll/issues/14

This project strives to be compliant with requirements set by [21st Century IDEA Act](https://www.meritalk.com/articles/senate-passes-idea-act/). The standards require that a website or digital service:

- is accessible to individuals with disabilities;
- has a consistent appearance;
- does not duplicate any legacy websites (the legislation also requires agencies to ensure that legacy websites are regularly reviewed, removed, and consolidated);
- has a search function;
- uses an industry standard secure connection;
- “is designed around user needs with data-driven analysis influencing management and development decisions, using qualitative and quantitative data to determine user goals, needs, and behaviors, and continually test the website, web-based form, web-based application, or digital service to ensure that user needs are addressed;”
- allows for user customization; and
- is mobile-friendly.

## Key Functionality
This repository contains the following examples and functionality:
 
*Complete:*  Publish blog posts, press releases, announcements, etc. To modify this code, check out `news/index.html`, which manages how the posts are listed. You should then check out `_layouts/post.html` to see how individual posts are structured.

*Complete:*  Publish single one-off pages. Instead of creating lots of folders throughout the root directory, you should put single pages in `_pages` folder and change the `permalink` at the top of each page. Use sub-folders only when you really need to.

*Complete:*  Publish lists (for example: job listings, links, references), you can use the template `_layouts/list.html`. Just create a file in you `_pages` folder with the following options:

```
---
title: Example Page
layout: list
permalink: /jobs
datafile: jobs
---
```

The reference to `datafile` referers to the name of the file in `_data/jobs.yml` and loops through the values. Feel free to modify this as needed.

*Complete:*  There are two different kinds of `pages`, one does not have a side bar navigation, and the other uses `_includes/sidenav.html`. You can enable this option by adding `sidenav: true` to your page front matter.

```
---
title: Example Page with Sidebar
layout: page
sidenav: true
permalink: /example-page-with-sidebar
---
```


*In Progress:* Searchable site. Integration with
[`jekyll_pages_api_search`](https://github.com/18F/jekyll_pages_api_search) is
in progress, but you can setup site search with [Search.gov](https://search.gov)
by adding your affiliate name to `_config.yml`.

*Pending:* Examples of how you can include large data files into your site and how to query and display the data.



## How to edit
- We try to keep configuration options to a minimum so you can easily remove functionality, but you can review `_config.yml` to see the options that are available to you. There are a few values on top that you **need** to change. They make reference to the agency name and contact information. The advanced options at the bottom should be changed only if you know what you know what you're doing.
- Do not edit files in the `assets/` folder. This folder is reserved for serving assets once the sites is compiled. If you want add your own custom code, add and edit files in `src/`, ideally mirroring the `assets/` folder structure. This will keep the code repository small and not include unneccessary files. 
- If you look at `package.json` you will see that the `npm run federalist` command will copy the contents from `src/` and move it over to `assets/` folder during the build process. If you want more advanced functionality, you should look into using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/configuration/).
- Do not edit files in the `_site/` folder. These files are automatically generated and changes you make there will be destroyed.
- You will most certainly need to edit files in `_includes/`, which include the primary menu, side navigation, logos etc
- `index.html` may not require much editing, depending on how you customize `hero.html` and `highlights.html`.
- `_layouts/` may require the least amount of editing of all the files since they are primarily responsible for printing the content.
- `news/index.html` can be edited, but be careful. It will impact the pagination system for the posts. If you do edit the file, be prepared to edit `_config.yml`. You should also familiarize yourself with [jekyll-paginate-v2](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2)
- Non-developers should focus only on `_posts` and `_pages`

## Known Issues
- The search gem is not compatible with latest version of Jekyll. More information [here](https://github.com/18F/jekyll_pages_api_search/pull/41)
- To set the underline indicator (`usa-current`) on the top menu, we need Javascript to match the routing. 

## Installation

Clone the repository.

    $ git clone https://github.com/18F/federalist-uswds-jekyll
    $ cd federalist-uswds-jekyll

Install the Node.js dependencies.

    $ npm install

Build the site.

    $ npm run build

Run the site locally.

    $ npm start

Open your web browser to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) to view your
site.

After you make changes, be sure to run the tests.

    $ npm test

Note that when built by Federalist, `npm run federalist` is used instead of the
`build` script.


## Technologies you should be familiarize yourself with

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) - The primary site engine that builds your code and content.
- [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter) - The top of each page/post includes keywords within `--` tags. This is meta data that helps Jekyll build the site, but you can also use it to pass custom variables.
- [U.S. Web Design System v 2.0](https://v2.designsystem.digital.gov) 
- [Jekyll Search](https://github.com/18F/jekyll_pages_api_search/)
