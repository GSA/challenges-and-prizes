rules: 'USSOCOM is pursuing a development effort to determine the operational
  utility of using CubeSats to directly support SOF in austere and denied areas.
  The intent is to solicit operationally relevant and technically feasible payload
  concepts for USSOCOM CubeSats.    &nbsp;    Example areas that are relevant
  to USSOCOM missions are (not an exhaustive list):  <ul>    <li>Next-generation
  CubeSat and/or sensor technologies</li>    <li>Advanced communications; including
  full orbit Command &amp; Control and data exfiltration</li>    <li>Electro-Optical
  (EO)/Infrared (IR) sensing and imaging</li>    <li>Multi/Hyper spectral sensor
  technology</li>    <li>Propulsion capabilities to modify or maintain orbits</li>    <li>Advanced
  On-Orbit data processing</li>    <li>Multi-function payloads</li>    <li>Tagging,

  Up to 7 - $5,000 prizes will be awarded in the following categories:    <strong>4</strong> -
  3U Winners    <strong>2</strong> - 6U Winners    <strong>1</strong> people’s
  Choice Award    &nbsp;    The $5,000 popular choice award will be awarded based
  on number of votes received during the voting period.  A competitor is eligible
  to win both a Judges'' Award and the People''s Choice Award.    All votes are
  subject to review. Any competitor using unfair methods to solicit votes will
  be automatically disqualified from the challenge.    Entries that are eligible
  for the voting stage will become viewable to the public. Make sure that if your
  entry moves on to the voting stage, that you''re OK with anyone seeing it! Depending
  on the number of entries received, either all or a selected shortlist will move
  on to the voting stage.    Potential future challenges may ask competitors to
  design, develop, and implement concept submissions entered in this challenge.    &nbsp;  <h2>How

description: 'CubeSats are gaining popularity among academia, industry, and government.
  CubeSats are miniature satellites that are commonly used in low Earth orbit, have
  been used for educational purposes, and recently for applications such as remote
  sensing, scientific experimentation, or communications.  As engineers become more
  familiar with the technology, CubeSats are also being considered for flights outside
  of Earth orbit — to locations such as the Moon, Mars, or Jupiter.  Read more about
  Cubesats <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cubesats/index.html" target="_blank"
  rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.    The CubeSat standard was first proposed in
  the late 1990s by two professors: Dr. Jordi Puig-Suari of California Polytechnic
  State University and Dr. Bob Twiggs of Stanford University. They were trying to
  help students gain engineering experience with satellites, which are traditionally
  expensive to build, launch, and operate.    The basic CubeSat is a 10-centimeter
  (~4-inch) cube (called 1U) with a mass around 1.33 kilograms (2.93 pounds), but
  variations on the theme are possible. 1.5, 2, or 3 1U cubes can stack to create
  a 1.5U, 2U, or 3U CubeSat.  6 1U cubes can create a 10x20x30 cm (6U) CubeSat for
  more complicated missions.    These small satellites cost significantly less to
  build, launch, and operate than traditional satellites.  The lower cost allows for
  more rapid integration of new technology and experimentation with new concepts.
  The small size and weight reduce launch cost and allow the CubeSat to share a rocket
  with a larger satellite.  CubeSats adhere to a set of standards that are based on
  “Safety of Flight” concepts that will “Do no harm” to primary payloads, which is
  why they are allowed to fly with the more expensive payloads on a “space available”
  basis.    To give you an example of the use of such small, yet powerful technologies,
  the Earth observation company Planet recently launched around 100 3U CubeSats from
  a single rocket to build a constellation capable of imaging the entire earth every
  day to support everything from disaster response to climate monitoring.    &nbsp;  <h2>Why
  Issue a Challenge?</h2>  Here’s where you come into play.    The United States Special
  Operations Command (USSOCOM) is the Unified Combatant Command charged with manning,
  training, and equipping the various Special Operations Component Commands of the
  Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force of the United States Armed Forces.  Core
  Activities within the scope of Special Operations Forces (SOF) include: Direct Action,
  Special Reconnaissance, Unconventional Warfare, Foreign Internal Defense, Civil
  Affairs Operations, Counterterrorism, Military Information Support Operations, Counter-proliferation
  of Weapons of Mass Destruction, Security Force Assistance, Counterinsurgency, Hostage
  Rescue and Recovery, and Foreign Humanitarian Assistance.    USSOCOM is unique in
  that it has service-like acquisition capabilities.  USSOCOM relies on private industry
  to develop SOF-peculiar equipment and technology to meet mission requirements while
  complying with federal acquisition regulations and federal law.    One of the guiding
  tenets of SOF is that most special operations require non-SOF assistance.  As such,
  USSOCOM is seeking global ideas on how to advance CubeSat capabilities. Specifically,
  USSOCOM is conducting this crowdsourcing challenge to solicit concepts that advance
  the state of current CubeSat technologies and payloads and demonstrate applications
  that may benefit any of the USSOCOM missions.  Concepts should be viable for a prototype
  demonstration within 12-24 months. These concepts will advance how CubeSats can
  be utilized to support Special Operations Forces (SOF) missions.'
