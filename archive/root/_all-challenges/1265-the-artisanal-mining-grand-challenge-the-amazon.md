  #### Overview


  The **Artisanal Mining Grand Challenge: the Amazon** is a global call for solutions awarding more than $1 million in prizes and support for innovations to make artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in the Amazon more environmentally responsible and socially equitable.


  Conservation X Labs (CXL) is administering the Challenge, with funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Microsoft, and ESRI, and technical input from the Center for Amazonian Scientific Innovation (CINCIA) and strategic implementation from the USAID/Peru Prevent project - Combating Environmental Crimes (Prevent).


  We are seeking innovations at the prototype or piloting stage that: 


  * **Safeguard ecosystems** and prevent, remediate, and restore impacts from ASGM at mining sites on biodiversity, water resources, and human health; 

  * **Optimize responsible supply chains** to increase transparency and traceability and enable gold purchasing that is environmentally responsible and socially equitable from the point of origin to its final sale;

  * **Promote and sustain formalization** of miners in the ASGM sector to achieve environmental and social safeguards and regulatory compliance.


  The goal of the Challenge is to provide promising innovators with funding and support to help innovations achieve environmental and social impact, become financially sustainable, and scale. Participating in this Challenge offers a number of benefits beyond just funding and monetary prizes, including access to a network of experts and leaders in the space; the opportunity to meet and learn from peers working on cutting-edge products and tools; mentorship on business and product development; opportunities to conduct field-testing and receive feedback from users and customers; and recognition and validation from our world-class evaluation panel.

  The competition seeks to inspire and identify innovations that:


  * Demonstrate potential to be financially sustainable and mitigate the negative environmental and social impacts within the ASGM sector

  * At a minimum, are ready to be field-tested in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Suriname, and/or Guyana and have proof of the potential for adoption by users and/or customers


  The competition is NOT looking for: 


  * Solutions that are in the concept or research phase

  * Pure policy solutions

  * Purely technical assistance, training, or capacity building programs 


  An innovation is a new or improved product or process (or combination thereof) that differs significantly from the unit’s previous products or processes and that has been made available to potential users (product) or brought into use by the unit (process). For the purposes of this competition, an innovation is a **process, tool, approach, and/or a digital solution** that has a functional prototype or proof of concept ready to be piloted by the closing of the application deadline. 


  There are many good ideas and innovations out there! However, this competition is specifically designed to support innovations that have an existing solution ready for piloting, fit within the overall scope and goals of the Challenge, and can be applied in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Suriname, and/or Guyana.


  In addition, eligible applications must meet the following minimum criteria. Your application may be disqualified from the competition if it does not meet all of the following criteria:


  * The application is complete and submitted by the deadline.

  * The application is in English or Spanish language. 

  * The innovation described in the application is within the Challenge scope. 

  * The innovation is a tangible tool, device, or process by the closing of the application deadline. 

  * The innovation is at an application readiness stage (ARL) stage between 3 to 6 (ranging from a proof of concept to solutions that have demonstrated a prototype in an operational environment). 

  * The innovation is ready to be field-tested or piloted in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Suriname, and/or Guyana. If a solution is for ASGM miners, field-testing may not occur with any illegal mining activity as determined by the jurisdiction of the test site. 

  * The application is submitted by an organization, including US organizations, non-US organizations, partner government entities, or public international organizations. This includes non-governmental organizations (international, national and local), private sector entities, universities / academia, community organizations that include indigenous groups, cooperatives / associations and other civil society partners. Partner government entities may apply but can only receive in-kind assistance. Individuals are not eligible to apply. Multiple organizations may collaborate to submit an application, but one organization must be named to assume the financial and administrative responsibility of the award.

  * The innovation cannot be purely a policy solution or technical assistance, training, and/or capacity building program. 

  * The innovation cannot have received a cash prize through the 2019-2020 Global Artisanal Mining Grand Challenge administered by Conservation X Labs. Applicants from the Global Artisanal Mining Grand Challenge that did not receive a cash prize, including those that were finalists and semi-finalists are eligible to apply to the Artisanal Mining Grand Challenge: the Amazon.

Failure by either Party to pay the fees (or provide a required deposit) of the arbitrators and/or the arbitration administrator in accordance with the rules and policies of the applicable arbitration administrator will result in a forfeiture by the non-paying Party of the right to prosecute or defend the claim which is the subject of the arbitration, but will not otherwise serve to abate, stay, or suspend the arbitration proceedings. The Parties will share equally the arbitrators’ fees and expenses, administrative expenses, or other costs incurred in the arbitration; provided, however, that each party shall bear its own attorneys’ and experts’ fees and its own costs incurred in connection with any Dispute hereunder including the arbitration of any Dispute. Further, each Party shall compensate and pay all expenses for its employees and, with respect to Team, all other Team Members for their participation in the arbitration.


  **9.8.2 Scope of Arbitrators’ Authority** – The arbitrators will have no power or authority to grant attorneys’ fees, punitive or exemplary damages as part of their award. In no event may the provisions of this Agreement, or any ancillary agreement executed in connection with this Agreement, including, without limitation, amendments to this Agreement, be waived, modified, changed, or otherwise equitably excused by the arbitrators at any arbitration hearing. The Parties do not grant the arbitrators the powers of an amiable compositeur and the arbitrators do not have the power to decide ex aequo et bono. The arbitrators will apply Washington DC substantive Law to the proceeding. The arbitrators will not have the power to commit errors of Law or legal reasoning, and the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error. Any arbitration will be conducted in English in Washington D.C., USA.


  **9.8.3 Jurisdiction for Entering Arbitration Awards** – The award of the arbitrators will be the exclusive remedy between the Parties regarding any claims, causes of action, counterclaims, issues, or accountings presented or pleaded to the arbitrators. Any petition, motion, or request to vacate the award shall be filed exclusively in the Superior Court of the District of the Columbia, and the Parties expressly consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the District of Columbia.


  **9.8.4 Stage 1 Arbitration** – The first stage of arbitration shall be conducted before JAMS in Washington DC, in accordance with the JAMS Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures by three (3) arbitrators appointed as follows: each Party shall select an arbitrator, and such arbitrators shall select a third; provided, however, that in all events at least two (2) out of the three (3) arbitrators must be active members of the bar of a U.S. State and that each arbitrator must be fluent in English. The matters to be considered and determined by the arbitrators in Stage 1 Arbitration shall include and be limited to the following:


  (i) First, the arbitrators shall determine whether or not the Party that served the Notice of Dispute strictly complied with the requirements set forth in Section 9.6 above. If the arbitrators determine that the Party that served the Notice of Dispute failed to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 9.6 above, then the arbitrators shall issue an award dismissing the Dispute with prejudice and ruling that the Party that served the Notice of Dispute shall take nothing thereunder.


  (ii) Next, if (a) the arbitrators determine that the Party that served the Notice of Dispute did strictly comply with the requirements of Section 9.6 above, and (b) either Party asserts that the Limitation of Liability provisions set forth in Section 8.5 above are unenforceable in whole or in part, then the arbitrators shall next determine whether or not the Dispute is subject to the Limitation of Liability provisions set forth in Section 8.5 above and issue a ruling of their findings. For purposes of this determination, the Parties agree and represent that the Limitation of Liability Clauses are not contrary to public policy.


  (iii) Each Party’s representation in this paragraph is a material inducement for the other party to enter into this agreement. If neither party asserts that the limitation of liability provisions set forth in Section 8.5 above are unenforceable in whole or in part, then the arbitrators shall issue a ruling that such provisions are fully enforceable with respect to the dispute.


  (iv) All awards, decisions and rulings made with regard to the items specified above by the arbitrators in Stage 1 Arbitration shall be binding upon both Parties and upon the arbitrators in 9.8.4 Stage 2 Arbitration (if applicable). However, except as required to establish the decisions and rulings of the arbitrators, the records of the proceedings in Stage 1 Arbitration shall not be admissible as evidence in Stage 2 Arbitration proceedings.


  **9.8.5 Ninety (90)-Day Cooling Off Period** – If the arbitrators have not dismissed the Dispute with prejudice when they issue their final rulings pursuant to Section 9.8.4 (i) above, then the Parties shall wait for a period of ninety (90) calendar days before proceeding with Stage 2 Arbitration, during which ninety (90)-day period, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve the Dispute. This period may be extended by mutual agreement of the Parties.


  **9.8.6 Stage 2 Arbitration** – If necessary, the second stage of arbitration shall be conducted before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Washington DC, in accordance with the then-prevailing Rules of Arbitration of the ICC by three (3) arbitrators appointed as follows: each Party shall select an arbitrator, and such arbitrators shall select a third; provided, however, that in all events at least two (2) out of the three (3) arbitrators must be active members of the bar of a U.S. State and that each arbitrator must be fluent in English. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the arbitrators used in Stage 1 Arbitration may be selected in Stage 2 Arbitration. 


  **9.9  Attorney’s Fees:**

  Unless otherwise expressly set forth herein, the Parties shall bear their own attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses in connection with the matters set forth in the Agreement.


  **10. Confidentiality**


  10.1 “Confidential Information” Defined: Pursuant to this Agreement, each Party may provide the other, or its affiliates, certain information or material that is confidential to the disclosing Party. Such information or materials shall be marked as “Confidential” by the disclosing Party prior to disclosure.


  10.2 Exclusions from “Confidential Information”: Information or material will not be considered as confidential hereunder if it: (i) is public knowledge as of the Effective Date or subsequently becomes such through no breach of this Agreement; (ii) is rightfully in the receiving Party’s possession prior to the disclosing Party’s disclosure, as shown by written records; (iii) is rightfully disclosed to the receiving Party by a third party without restriction on its disclosure; (iv) is independently developed by or for the receiving Party without reliance upon Confidential Information received from the disclosing Party; and/or (v) is required to be disclosed by law.


  10.3 Obligation of Confidentiality: Each Party will: (i) hold the other Party’s Confidential Information in confidence (using at least the same measures as it does to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature) and not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party except to the extent permitted by the terms of this Agreement; and (ii) not remove or permit to be removed from any item any proprietary, confidential, or copyright notices, markings, or legends placed thereon by either Party.

### Description

#### Overview

The **Artisanal Mining Grand Challenge: the Amazon** is a global call for solutions awarding more than $1 million in prizes and support for innovations to make artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in the Amazon more environmentally responsible and socially equitable.

Conservation X Labs (CXL) is administering the Challenge, with funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Microsoft, and ESRI, and technical input from the Center for Amazonian Scientific Innovation (CINCIA) and strategic implementation from the USAID/Peru Prevent project - Combating Environmental Crimes (Prevent).

We are seeking innovations at the prototype or piloting stage that: 

* **Safeguard ecosystems** and prevent, remediate, and restore impacts from ASGM at mining sites on biodiversity, water resources, and human health; 
* **Optimize responsible supply chains** to increase transparency and traceability and enable gold purchasing that is environmentally responsible and socially equitable from the point of origin to its final sale;
* **Promote and sustain formalization** of miners in the ASGM sector to achieve environmental and social safeguards and regulatory compliance.

The goal of the Challenge is to provide promising innovators with funding and support to help innovations achieve environmental and social impact, become financially sustainable, and scale. Participating in this Challenge offers a number of benefits beyond just funding and monetary prizes, including access to a network of experts and leaders in the space; the opportunity to meet and learn from peers working on cutting-edge products and tools; mentorship on business and product development; opportunities to conduct field-testing and receive feedback from users and customers; and recognition and validation from our world-class evaluation panel.

Challenge administrators have allocated **50% of the grants** for Challenge finalists for applicants from partner countries in the USAID Amazon Regional Environment Program (Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname) though field-testing may only occur in Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, and/or Suriname.

### Rules

The competition seeks to inspire and identify innovations that:

* Demonstrate potential to be financially sustainable and mitigate the negative environmental and social impacts within the ASGM sector
* At a minimum, are ready to be field-tested in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Suriname, and/or Guyana and have proof of the potential for adoption by users and/or customers

The competition is NOT looking for: 

* Solutions that are in the concept or research phase
* Pure policy solutions
* Purely technical assistance, training, or capacity building programs 

An innovation is a new or improved product or process (or combination thereof) that differs significantly from the unit’s previous products or processes and that has been made available to potential users (product) or brought into use by the unit (process). For the purposes of this competition, an innovation is a **process, tool, approach, and/or a digital solution** that has a functional prototype or proof of concept ready to be piloted by the closing of the application deadline. 

There are many good ideas and innovations out there! However, this competition is specifically designed to support innovations that have an existing solution ready for piloting, fit within the overall scope and goals of the Challenge, and can be applied in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Suriname, and/or Guyana.

In addition, eligible applications must meet the following minimum criteria. Your application may be disqualified from the competition if it does not meet all of the following criteria:

* The application is complete and submitted by the deadline.
* The application is in English or Spanish language. 
* The innovation described in the application is within the Challenge scope. 
* The innovation is a tangible tool, device, or process by the closing of the application deadline. 
* The innovation is at an application readiness stage (ARL) stage between 3 to 6 (ranging from a proof of concept to solutions that have demonstrated a prototype in an operational environment). 
* The innovation is ready to be field-tested or piloted in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Suriname, and/or Guyana. If a solution is for ASGM miners, field-testing may not occur with any illegal mining activity as determined by the jurisdiction of the test site. 
* The application is submitted by an organization, including US organizations, non-US organizations, partner government entities, or public international organizations. This includes non-governmental organizations (international, national and local), private sector entities, universities / academia, community organizations that include indigenous groups, cooperatives / associations and other civil society partners. Partner government entities may apply but can only receive in-kind assistance. Individuals are not eligible to apply. Multiple organizations may collaborate to submit an application, but one organization must be named to assume the financial and administrative responsibility of the award.
* The innovation cannot be purely a policy solution or technical assistance, training, and/or capacity building program. 
* The innovation cannot have received a cash prize through the 2019-2020 Global Artisanal Mining Grand Challenge administered by Conservation X Labs. Applicants from the Global Artisanal Mining Grand Challenge that did not receive a cash prize, including those that were finalists and semi-finalists are eligible to apply to the Artisanal Mining Grand Challenge: the Amazon.

**9.8 Arbitration:** 
If the Parties are not able to settle the Dispute in mediation pursuant to Section 9.7 above, Applicant and CXL agree that: (i) any Dispute; (ii) any issues pertaining to the Dispute; and/or (iii) any claim that this Agreement or any part hereof is invalid, illegal, or otherwise voidable or void, shall be submitted to and finally determined by mandatory and binding arbitration.

Failure to file the demand to arbitrate with JAMS within such 180-day period shall mean that any right to arbitrate or litigate in any manner such Dispute shall be forever forfeited and waived.

**9.8.1 Mandatory and Binding Arbitration** – The arbitration and the Parties’ agreement therefore will be deemed to be self-executing, and if either Party fails to appear at any properly-noticed arbitration proceeding, an award may be entered against such Party despite said failure to appear and the matter will be dismissed with prejudice.

The Parties will share equally the arbitrators’ fees and expenses, administrative expenses, or other costs incurred in the arbitration; provided, however, that each party shall bear its own attorneys’ and experts’ fees and its own costs incurred in connection with any Dispute hereunder including the arbitration of any Dispute. Further, each Party shall compensate and pay all expenses for its employees and, with respect to Team, all other Team Members for their participation in the arbitration.

**9.8.2 Scope of Arbitrators’ Authority** – The arbitrators will have no power or authority to grant attorneys’ fees, punitive or exemplary damages as part of their award. In no event may the provisions of this Agreement, or any ancillary agreement executed in connection with this Agreement, including, without limitation, amendments to this Agreement, be waived, modified, changed, or otherwise equitably excused by the arbitrators at any arbitration hearing. The Parties do not grant the arbitrators the powers of an amiable compositeur and the arbitrators do not have the power to decide ex aequo et bono.

The arbitrators will not have the power to commit errors of Law or legal reasoning, and the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error. Any arbitration will be conducted in English in Washington D.C., USA.

**9.8.3 Jurisdiction for Entering Arbitration Awards** – The award of the arbitrators will be the exclusive remedy between the Parties regarding any claims, causes of action, counterclaims, issues, or accountings presented or pleaded to the arbitrators. Any petition, motion, or request to vacate the award shall be filed exclusively in the Superior Court of the District of the Columbia, and the Parties expressly consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the District of Columbia.

If the arbitrators determine that the Party that served the Notice of Dispute failed to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 9.6 above, then the arbitrators shall issue an award dismissing the Dispute with prejudice and ruling that the Party that served the Notice of Dispute shall take nothing thereunder.

(ii) Next, if (a) the arbitrators determine that the Party that served the Notice of Dispute did strictly comply with the requirements of Section 9.6 above, and (b) either Party asserts that the Limitation of Liability provisions set forth in Section 8.5 above are unenforceable in whole or in part, then the arbitrators shall next determine whether or not the Dispute is subject to the Limitation of Liability provisions set forth in Section 8.5 above and issue a ruling of their findings. For purposes of this determination, the Parties agree and represent that the Limitation of Liability Clauses are not contrary to public policy.

(iii) Each Party’s representation in this paragraph is a material inducement for the other party to enter into this agreement. If neither party asserts that the limitation of liability provisions set forth in Section 8.5 above are unenforceable in whole or in part, then the arbitrators shall issue a ruling that such provisions are fully enforceable with respect to the dispute.

(iv) All awards, decisions and rulings made with regard to the items specified above by the arbitrators in Stage 1 Arbitration shall be binding upon both Parties and upon the arbitrators in 9.8.4 Stage 2 Arbitration (if applicable). However, except as required to establish the decisions and rulings of the arbitrators, the records of the proceedings in Stage 1 Arbitration shall not be admissible as evidence in Stage 2 Arbitration proceedings.

**9.8.5 Ninety (90)-Day Cooling Off Period** – If the arbitrators have not dismissed the Dispute with prejudice when they issue their final rulings pursuant to Section 9.8.4 (i) above, then the Parties shall wait for a period of ninety (90) calendar days before proceeding with Stage 2 Arbitration, during which ninety (90)-day period, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve the Dispute. This period may be extended by mutual agreement of the Parties.

**9.8.6 Stage 2 Arbitration** – If necessary, the second stage of arbitration shall be conducted before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Washington DC, in accordance with the then-prevailing Rules of Arbitration of the ICC by three (3) arbitrators appointed as follows: each Party shall select an arbitrator, and such arbitrators shall select a third; provided, however, that in all events at least two (2) out of the three (3) arbitrators must be active members of the bar of a U.S. State and that each arbitrator must be fluent in English.

10.5 Injunctive Relief: Each Party acknowledges that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Section 11 above (Confidentiality), and such breach would result in irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, each Party, in addition to any other remedies that it may have, will be entitled, without the requirement of proving actual damages or posting a bond or other security (to the extent permitted under Law), to obtain equitable relief, including without limitation injunctive relief and specific performance in any court of competent jurisdiction.

CXL shall consider such communication in good faith and will then determine whether or not (in its sole discretion) to waive this requirement with respect to the particular facility or event. The parties acknowledge and agree that Applicant’s agreement to provide such preferential access constitutes material consideration under this Agreement and CXL’s ability to capture and use CXL Media in communications to the general public is a primary purpose for which the Challenge is conducted. Accordingly, submission of bad faith requests or other abuse of this provision may, in the sole discretion of CXL, result in Applicant’s disqualification or other adverse consequences to Applicant.
