    <li>Mechanical Failure Strength of Baseline and Self-Healing Laminate Substrates:&nbsp; The baseline and self-healing laminates shall be tested to failure in both tension and flexure to establish the respective strength capacity of each configuration and to demonstrate little/no structural integrity reductions occur in self-healing design over the non-healing baseline.</li>
    <li>The self-healing methodology shall not significantly influence the tensile or flexure failure strength of the overall laminate as compared to the strength of the non-healing laminate</li>
    <li>Demonstration of Self-Healing Capabilities in a Dry Environment:&nbsp; Utilizing the results of the strength characterization testing as a baseline, samples of the self-healing laminate shall be loaded to 5%, 10%, 25%, and 50% of the expected failure stress in both tension and flexure (independently) and subsequently allowed to self-heal in a dry environment.</li>
    <li>Post healing, the samples shall be reloaded to failure and the capability of the healing method shall be quantified in terms of baseline material strengths</li>
    <li>Demonstration of Self-Healing Capabilities in a Submerged Salt Water Environment:&nbsp; Utilizing the results of the strength characterization testing as a baseline, Samples of the self-healing laminate shall be loaded to 5%, 10%, 25%, and 50% of the expected failure stress in both tension and flexure (independently) and subsequently allowed to self-heal in a submerged salt water environment.</li>
    <li>Post healing, the samples shall be reloaded to failure and the capability of the healing method shall be quantified in terms of baseline material strengths.</li>
    </ul>

<p>The virtual proof of life check of the Minimum Viable Product shall be presented to the Navy experts. The virtual presentation shall present a preliminary concept / design. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Phase III: The offeror shall be evaluated based on the below demonstration and resulting datacriteria (using the same matrix as previously detailed above):</p>
<ul>
<li>Underlying Baseline Laminate Substrate: For the purposes of demonstration, the solid laminate substrate to which the self-healing solution is demonstrated shall be 0.1&rdquo; thick and a balanced, bi-axial construction laminate plate/panel.</li>
<li>Void Content and Fiber Volume Fraction shall be quantified and will be evaluated in accordance with the matrix detailed above.</li>
<li>Mechanical Characterization of Baseline and Self-Healing Laminate Substrates: Mechanical material properties shall be characterized for the baseline (no healing implementation) and self-healing laminate for both tensile and flexure stiffness/strength data according to ASTM Standard D3039-14 and ASTM Standard ASTM D7264 / D7264M, respectively. These baseline tensile and flexural material properties will serve as the basis for comparison the material degradation quantification tests below.</li>
<li>Mechanical Failure Strength of Baseline and Self-Healing Laminate Substrates: The baseline and self-healing laminates shall be tested to failure in both tension and flexure to establish the respective strength capacity of each configuration and to demonstrate little/no structural integrity reductions occur in self-healing design over the non-healing baseline.</li>
<li>The self-healing methodology shall not significantly influence the tensile or flexure failure strength of the overall laminate as compared to the strength of the non-healing laminate</li>
<li>Demonstration of Self-Healing Capabilities in a Dry Environment: Utilizing the results of the strength characterization testing as a baseline, samples of the self-healing laminate shall be loaded to 5%, 10%, 25%, and 50% of the expected failure stress in both tension and flexure (independently) and subsequently allowed to self-heal in a dry environment.</li>
<li>Post healing, the samples shall be reloaded to failure and the capability of the healing method shall be quantified in terms of baseline material strengths</li>
<li>Demonstration of Self-Healing Capabilities in a Submerged Salt Water Environment: Utilizing the results of the strength characterization testing as a baseline, Samples of the self-healing laminate shall be loaded to 5%, 10%, 25%, and 50% of the expected failure stress in both tension and flexure (independently) and subsequently allowed to self-heal in a submerged salt water environment.</li>
<li>Post healing, the samples shall be reloaded to failure and the capability of the healing method shall be quantified in terms of baseline material strengths.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases results shall be normalized to non-self-healing plate weight (per unit area)</p>
