  class="column">    <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Design-Brief-Final-2.pdf">Design-Brief-Final-2</a>    &nbsp;    <em><strong>How
  might we empower people to design their own learning journeys so they can lead purposeful
  and economically stable lives?</strong></em><p><strong>The Problem</strong>    Technology
  is rapidly transforming the way we live, learn, and work. Entirely new jobs are
  emerging as others are lost to automation. People are living longer, yet switching
  jobs more often. These dramatic shifts call for a reimagining of the way we prepare
  for work and life—specifically, how we learn new skills and adapt to a changing
  economic landscape.    The changes ahead are likely to hurt most those who can least
  afford to manage them: low-income and first generation learners already ill-served
  by our existing postsecondary education system. Our current system stifles economic
  mobility and widens income and achievement gaps; we must act now to ensure that
  we have an educational ecosystem flexible and fair enough to help all people live
  purposeful and economically stable lives. And if we are to design solutions proportionate
  to this problem, new technologies must be called on to scale approaches that reach
  the millions of vulnerable people across the country.</p><p><strong>The Challenge</strong>    The
  Challenge—Reimagining the Higher Education Ecosystem—seeks bold ideas for how our
  postsecondary education system could be reimagined to foster equity and encourage
  learner agency and resilience. We seek specific pilots to move us toward a future
  in which all learners can achieve economic stability and lead purposeful lives.    This
  Challenge invites participants to articulate a vision and then design pilot projects
  for a future ecosystem that has the following characteristics:    <br>●  Expands access:​
  The educational system must ensure that all people—including low-income learners
  who are disproportionately underserved by the current higher education system—can
  leverage education to live meaningful and economically stable lives.    <br>●  Draws
  on a broad postsecondary ecosystem:​ While college and universities play a vital
  role in educating students, there is a much larger ecosystem in which students learn.
  This ecosystem includes non-traditional “classes” or alternative learning providers,
  such as MOOCs, bootcamps, and online courses as well as on-the-job training and
  informal learning. Our future learning system must value the learning that happens
  in many different environments and enable seamless transitions between learning,
  work, and life.</p><p> <strong>Opportunity Areas</strong>    We have identified three
  important categories ripe for innovative solutions. We encourage submissions aligned
  to one or more of these opportunity areas.    Curating lifelong learning pathways:​
  People are working longer and in jobs that require them to keep learning new skills.
  As a result, instead of completing most of their education before they start their
  careers, they are learning continuously over the course of their lifetimes. How
  might we ensure that people have access to learning opportunities that match their
  evolving personal and professional goals? In particular, can you imagine new types
  of education-to-work pathways and credentials that support low-income people and
  other disadvantaged populations in achieving living-wage work?</p><p>Creating a marketplace
  for student learning:​ ​Increasingly, people are collecting learning experiences
  and the credentials that communicate their accomplishments from multiple education
  providers. How might we create educational marketplaces that help learners discover
  and curate learning resources aligned with their goals? Taking this one step further,
  what ideas do you have to help learners effectively signal the knowledge and skills
  they collect from multiple sources? And how will we ensure that all different kinds
  of employers from various sectors will actually recognize and understand the meaning
  of these credentials?    Leveraging emerging technology:​ ​Technologies such as
  blockchain, artificial intelligence, and virtual and mixed reality allow us to solve
  problems that we could not solve before. How might we leverage these emerging technologies
  to improve individual learning experiences? More broadly, how might open standards
  on competencies and assessments be used to bridge the education and workforce ecosystems?
  As increasing amounts of data about individuals are generated through this technology-rich
  learning environment, how might we allow people to own and securely manage their
  own digital identities, electing when and how that information is shared?</p><p><strong>Guidance</strong>    During
  this Challenge, we’re excited to see ideas that:    <br>●  Incorporate specific, actionable
  pilots (or “scalable betas”) that can be launched in the near term.    <br>●  Demonstrate
  relevance for traditionally underserved populations (such as people with low incomes,
  new    immigrants, first-generation learners, and transitioning service members,
  etc.).    <br>●  Address one or more of the three opportunity areas identified.    <br>●
   Facilitate seamless transitions between learning and work.    <br>●  Include “big bet”
  ideas that enable transformative change.</p><p><strong>Logistics &amp; Prizes</strong>    <br>●
   The Challenge runs June 13 - August 8. Winners will be announced in early fall.    <br>●
   Prizes include national recognition, an invitation to a national convening sponsored
  by the U.S. Department of    Education, mentorship packages, and priority consideration
  for edtech accelerators and/or pitch competitions.    <br>●  After a period of refinement,
  top ideas will be put before philanthropic and venture funders for consideration.    </div>  </div>  </div>  </div>  <div
