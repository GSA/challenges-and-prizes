  to: <a href="mailto:usarmy.pentagon.hqda-asa-alt.mbx.xtechsearch@mail.mil">usarmy.pentagon.hqda-asa-alt.mbx.xtechsearch@mail.mil</a>.
  Specific instructions and deadlines are described below.    <em>Registration Form:</em> <a
  href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/xTechSearch-Registration-Form.pdf">xTechSearch-Registration-Form</a>    &nbsp;    <strong>Background
  Information:</strong>    The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics
  and Technology (ASA(ALT)) is announcing the Army Expeditionary Technology Search
  – xTechSearch – to be featured at the Association of the United States Army (AUSA)
  Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C., on 8 to 10 October 2018. xTechSearch will highlight
  opportunities for nontraditional defense partners to collaborate with the Army to
  tackle the most poignant Army modernization challenges.    The ASA(ALT) recognizes
  that the Army must enhance engagements with the entrepreneurial funded community,
  small businesses, and other non-traditional defense partners, by: (1) understanding
  the spectrum of technologies being developed commercially that may benefit the Army;
  (2) integrating the sector of nontraditional innovators into the Army’s research
  and development ecosystem; and (3) providing mentorship and expertise to accelerate,
  mature, and transition technologies of interest to the Army.    Pursuant to Title
  15, United States Code, Section 3719, the xTechSearch competition will provide prizes
  to select businesses for innovative technologies and ideas that can solve Army challenges.
  The program will also integrate these nontraditional innovators into the Army’s
  Science and Technology (S&amp;T) ecosystem by providing cooperative research opportunities
  with Army labs, including access to the Army’s organic intellectual and technical
  capital. xTechSearch is an opportunity for small businesses to pitch technology
  solutions – a new application for an existing technology or a new technology concept
  entirely – to the Army.    xTechSearch is a novel approach for linking innovators
  directly with the Army labs, with a focus on lowering the entrance barriers and
  spurring innovation.    &nbsp;    <strong>Eligibility Requirements:</strong>    The
  entities allowed to participate in this competition are small businesses as defined
  in 13 C.F.R. Part 121. To qualify, the participating entity must fall within the
  size standard by North American Industry Classification System code 541713, 541714,
  and 541715.    There may be only one submission per business. In addition, each
  entity:  <ul>    <li>Shall provide registration information in the xTechSearch Cover
  Letter registration form;</li>    <li>Shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary
  place of business in the United States;</li>    <li>Shall perform the work in the
  United States.</li>    <li>May not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting
  within the scope of their employment.</li>  </ul>  Registered participants shall
  be required to agree to assume any and all risks and waive claims against the Federal
  Government and its related entities, except in the case of willful misconduct, for
  any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue, or profits, whether direct,
  indirect, or consequential, arising from their participation in a prize competition,
  whether the injury, death, damage, or loss arises through negligence or otherwise.    Participants
  shall be required to obtain liability insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility,
  in amounts determined by the Army, for claims by—  <ul>    <li>Third parties for
  death, bodily injury, or property damage, or loss resulting from an activity carried
  out in connection with participation in a prize competition, with the Federal Government
  named as an additional insured under the registered participant’s insurance policy
  and registered participants agreeing to indemnify the Federal Government against
  third party claims for damages arising from or related to prize competition activities;
  and</li>    <li>Federal Government for damage or loss to Government property resulting
  from such an activity.</li>  </ul>  &nbsp;    <strong>Intellectual property</strong>    The
  Army is a strong proponent of deliberate intellectual property (IP) rights and management
  by the private sector and the Department of Defense. A deliberate and commercially
  oriented IP management posture will foster greater innovation while preventing the
  loss of military technologies to open sources which may benefit adversaries. Enhanced
  IP management, coupled with modularity and open system architecture, improves our
  ability to deliver systems that can be readily adapted to partner needs and integrated
  with their existing systems while advancing interoperability.    For the xTechSearch
  program:  <ul>    <li>The Federal Government may not gain an interest in IP developed
  by a participant without the written consent of the participant;</li>    <li>Nothing
  in the xTechSearch prize competition shall diminish the Government''s rights in
  patents, technical data, technical information, computer software, computer databases
  and computer software documentation that the Government had prior to this xTechSearch
  prize competition, or is entitled to, under any other Government Agreement of contract,
  or is otherwise entitled to under law; and</li>    <li>The Federal Government may
  negotiate a license for the use of IP developed by a registered participant in the
  prize competition.</li>  </ul>  &nbsp;    <strong>Technology Focus Areas:</strong>    The
  Army wants the innovation community to explore the full ideation space and the art-of-the-possible.
