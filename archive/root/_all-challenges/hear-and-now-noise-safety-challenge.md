prize-description-0: We will select the 10 best ideas and invite to pitch their
  selected ideas to an investor/judge panel at the Noise Safety Challenge.  Winning
  ideas will be considered by NIOSH Research to Practice (r2p) and interact with
  US Patent Office representatives.    NIOSH r2p's mission is to increase the
  use, adoption, and adaptation of technologies in practice to prevent occupational
  fatalities, injuries, and illnesses. NIOSH partners with any individual, group,
  or organization (e.g., government, labor, academic, business, trade or professional
  association) to enhance NIOSH-funded research activities and to promote the
  movement of research into practice.

description: 'Twenty-two million workers are exposed to potentially damaging noise
  at work each year. Last year, U.S. businesses paid more than $1.5 million in penalties for
  not protecting workers. While it’s impossible to put a number on the human toll
  of hearing loss, an estimated $242 million is spent annually on workers’ compensation
  for hearing loss disability.    Hearing loss is pervasive. It is also preventable.
  Ways to prevent work-induced hearing loss include using quieter machines, isolating
  the noise source, minimizing worker exposure, or creating more effective protective
  equipment.    Design a new technology concept that overcomes barriers in work-induced
  hearing loss prevention. For example, you could:  <ul>    <li>Design technology
  that will enhance employer training so that wearing hearing protection becomes a
  habit.</li>    <li>Design a real-time detection system that will alert workers,
  wirelessly through their mobile devices, when hearing protection is not blocking
  enough noise to prevent hearing loss.</li>    <li>Design selective hearing protectors
  that allow workers to hear important alerts or human voices while protected from
  harmful noise.</li>  </ul>  Don’t limit yourself to these three ideas. Use your
  experiences to inspire a solution.    Please visit the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/featured/hearing/">Hear
  and Now main webpage</a> for more information.'
