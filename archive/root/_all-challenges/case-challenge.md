description: "<h3><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Every day we make decisions
  about whether the people and information sources around us are reliable, honest,
  and trustworthy &ndash; the person, their actions, what they say, a news source,
  or the actual information being conveyed. Often, the only tool to help us make those
  decisions are our own judgments based on current or past experiences.</p>\r\n<p><img
  src=\"/assets/images/ids-images/CASE-explainer-sketch.png\" width=\"772\" height=\"218\"
  /></p>\r\n<p>For some in-person and virtual interactions there are tools to aid
  our judgments. These might include listening to the way someone tells a story, looking
  at a user badge, validating with other people - or in more formal settings, verifying
  biometrics or recording someone&rsquo;s physiological responses, i.e. the polygraph.</p>\r\n<p>Each
  of these examples uses a very different type of tool to augment our ability to evaluate
  credibility. Yet there are no standardized and rigorous tests to evaluate how comprehensive
  or accurate such tools really are.</p>\r\n<p>Countless studies have tested a variety
  of credibility assessment techniques and have attempted to use them to rigorously
  determine when a source and/or a message is credible and, more specifically, when
  a person is lying or telling the truth.</p>\r\n<p>Despite the large and lengthy
  investment in such research, a rigorous set of valid methods that are useful in
  determining the credibility of a source or their information across different applications
  remains difficult to achieve.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>TIMELINE</strong></h3>\r\n<p><img
  src=\"/assets/images/ids-images/CASEtimeline-04.png\" width=\"819\" height=\"202\"
  /></p>\r\n<h3><strong>DETAILS</strong></h3>\r\n<p>IARPA's Credibility Assessment
  Standardized Evaluation (CASE) Challenge seeks novel methods to measure the performance
  of credibility assessment techniques and technologies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Credibility
  assessment refers to both the assessment of the truthfulness of specific claims
  and to the assessment of the reliability, honesty, and trustworthiness of a source
  of a particular claim, whether that be an individual, group, or a broader organization
  or entity.This challenge is focused on the methods used to evaluate credibility
  assessment techniques or technologies, rather than on the techniques or technologies
  themselves. In this context, a method is a detailed plan or set of actions that
  can be easily replicated or followed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In this challenge, we ask
  that your solution is a method for conducting a study, which includes background
  information, the objectives of the research, study design, the logistics and means
  for running the study, and details about what data would be collected if your solution
  were implemented.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>CONTACT</strong></h3>\r\n<p>CaseChallenge@iarpa.gov</p>"
