  Content:</strong>    Submit a narrative of up to 500 words that clearly and
  concisely describes the nominee’s best program design, enhancement, expansion,
  or experience and accomplishments as a member for the award category selected.
  Ideally, the narrative will include evidence of the nominee’s impact in the
  community or on the program or other local projects, as well as evidence to
  support the nominee’s work or service as innovative, a best practice and/or
  a highly compelling and motivating experience.    Submissions may also include
  photos. Photos should support the narrative submission and not replace it. Photos
  are encouraged as they are often very helpful in telling the complete service
  story. Please note that photos are not required.    By submitting a nomination,
  each participant automatically confers on CNCS an irrevocable, nonexclusive,
  and unrestricted license to use the submitted content for purposes consistent
  with the agency’s national service mission. This includes the right to copy,
  reproduce, display, or distribute the content of the submission, and to make
  derivative works based upon the submission or a substantial portion of it without
  attribution or prior permission.    <strong>Instructions for Writing the Nomination
  Narrative:</strong>  <ol>    <li>Each nomination should specify from the eligibility
  list the program with which it is affiliated. In addition, the narrative should
  address how the AmeriCorps member or program is addressing one of the award
  categories. Enter the award category and full name of the nominee in the Title
  field in the Submit Solution link.</li>    <li>Clearly identify the full name
  of the nominee, the AmeriCorps program affiliation, and the award category in
  the first sentence of the nomination narrative.</li>    <li>Provide the full
  name and email address of the nominator and the nominator’s affiliation with
  the nominee in the second sentence of the nomination. Note that nominations will
  not be considered complete or reviewed without the full name and contact information
  for the nominator.</li>    <li>Select <u>only one program affiliation and only
  one nomination category</u> for each submission. In the event a program and
  individual are both eligible to be nominated, submit two separate nominations:
  one for the new or enhanced program and one for the member, following the award
  category descriptions.</li>    <li>Describe how the nominee exemplifies excellence
  in AmeriCorps service or programming. Consider these questions: what made the
  service excellent? what data can you provide to support the impact the member
  or program made?</li>    <li>Provide details that vividly illustrate the significance
  of the nominated member service/program. Details should clearly show how the
  nominated service goes above and beyond the excellent service that is expected
  from all AmeriCorps members and programs each year.</li>    <li>Tailor the nomination
  narrative to the Excellence in AmeriCorps Awards instructions.</li>    <li>Carefully
  proof read and review the nomination for completeness before submitting it in
  the Challenge Program.</li>  </ol>  &nbsp;    <strong>Format for Submitting

  Asked Questions and Answers:</strong>    <em>–Could you provide the definition
  of “AmeriCorps programming?” In order for a program to be eligible for a program
  award, does it have to be funded entirely through AmeriCorps, or is it sufficient
  that VISTA members serve and contribute to the program?</em>    Answer: AmeriCorps
  programming can mean a program that is entirely focused on and funded by AmeriCorps,
  or the program can be multi-faceted and include a variety of activities (with
  only one AmeriCorps component). Based on your description, it sounds like the
  VISTA member service could apply. The nomination narrative would provide more
  details on the focused effort of the VISTAs, results, etc.    <em>–Is there
  a word limit on the nominations?</em>    Answer: Yes, the nomination narrative limit
  is 500 words.    <em>–How do I submit a nomination?</em>    Answer: Log on to
  <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">www.challenge.gov</a>, and search for 2018
  Excellence in AmeriCorps Awards on the homepage. Once you open the AmeriCorps
  nomination form (it’s called a Solution in <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">www.challenge.gov</a>),
  you’ll see links on the left-side of the page that include Challenge Details,
  Discussions, Solutions, Rules, and Submit Solution. Open Challenge Details and
  Rules to find all the details on the AmeriCorps awards: the eligibility criteria,
  the award categories, the nomination narrative instructions, and instructions
  for writing the nomination. The nomination narrative should be entered in the
  Description field on the Submit Solution link on the left-side of the award
  page. Enter the number and nomination category title and the full name of the
  nominee in the Title field on the Submit Solution link. Open the Discussions
  link to ask a question about the nomination process, form, etc. Complete the
  nomination narrative and attach photos, if desired (photos are not required), in
  the Description field of the Submit Solution link. The online system will generate
  an automated message when your Solution is submitted successfully. Be sure to
  check your email’s spam filter or clutter to confirm that you received the notification.    <em>–I
  understand that self-nominations are not eligible; however, can a program director
  nominate her own program for one of the program categories?</em>    Answer:
  A program staff member may nominate her program in one of the program categories,
  and a program may nominate a member or alumna/us from its own program for one
  of the member categories.'
