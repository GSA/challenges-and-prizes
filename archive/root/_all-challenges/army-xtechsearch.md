description: "<h4><strong>Background</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The Assistant Secretary of
  the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA(ALT)) is announcing the
  second cohort of the Army Expeditionary Technology Search &ndash; xTechSearch &ndash;
  to be featured at the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Global Force
  Meeting in Huntsville, AL, on 26 to 28 March 2019. xTechSearch will highlight opportunities
  for nontraditional defense partners to collaborate with the Army to tackle the most
  poignant Army modernization challenges.</p>\r\n<p>The ASA(ALT) recognizes that the
  Army must enhance engagements with the entrepreneurial funded community, small businesses,
  and other non-traditional defense partners, by: (1) understanding the spectrum of
  technologies being developed commercially that may benefit the Army; (2) integrating
  the sector of nontraditional innovators into the Army&rsquo;s research and development
  ecosystem; and (3) providing mentorship and expertise to accelerate, mature, and
  transition technologies of interest to the Army.</p>\r\n<p>The xTechSearch program
  will provide resourcing to select businesses to demonstrate proof of concept for
  their technologies pertaining to Army challenges.&nbsp; The program will also integrate
  these nontraditional innovators into the Army&rsquo;s Science and Technology (S&amp;T)
  ecosystem by providing cooperative research opportunities with Army labs, including
  access to the Army&rsquo;s organic intellectual and technical capital.&nbsp; xTechSearch
  is an opportunity for businesses to pitch novel technology solutions &ndash; a new
  application for an existing technology or a new technology concept entirely &ndash;
  to the Army.&nbsp; The Army will provide non-dilutive seed prizes for the companies
  to demonstrate proof of concept in an Army-relevant challenge area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Technology
  Focus Areas</strong></h4>\r\n<p>xTechSearch seeks novel, disruptive concepts and
  technologies to support the following Army technology focus areas:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Long
  Range Precision Fires</strong>. Provide massed, mobile, operational-level kinetic
  and non-kinetic strike options to restore overmatch, improve deterrence, and disrupt
  Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD) on a complex, contested, and expanded battlefield.
  Potential technology areas include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Propulsion for extended long-range
  missiles</li>\r\n<li>Extended range cannon artillery</li>\r\n<li>Enhanced guidance/navigation
  for weapon systems</li>\r\n<li>Advanced energetics</li>\r\n<li>Advanced warheads
  for cluster munitions</li>\r\n<li>Next-generation RADARs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Next
  Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV)</strong>. Develop replacements for current tanks
  and infantry fighting vehicles that realize weight, sustainment, and cost-per-unit
  savings.&nbsp; This will increase the capability of our existing formations and
  improve our ability to survive and win in the complex and densely urbanized terrain
  of an intensely lethal and distributed battlefield where all domains are continually
  contested. Potential technology areas include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>NGCV Design</li>\r\n<li>Vehicle
  Protection against advanced threats</li>\r\n<li>Robotics and autonomy for combat
  operations and logistics</li>\r\n<li>Advanced power generation</li>\r\n<li>Advanced
  materials</li>\r\n<li>Efficient Manned-Unmanned Teaming Constructs</li>\r\n<li>Artificial
  Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Autonomy</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Future
  Vertical Lift (FVL)</strong> to develop replacement aviation platforms that include
  unmanned and autonomous attack, reconnaissance, utility, and MEDEVAC with increased
  speed and extended range and station time to operate in complex, dense urban terrain
  on an intensely lethal, distributed, and expanded battlefield within contested air
  space. Potential technology areas include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Platform development
  and demonstration</li>\r\n<li>Next-generation unmanned aircraft system technologies</li>\r\n<li>Aviation
  protection and aircraft survivability</li>\r\n<li>Improved situational awareness</li>\r\n<li>Integrated
  Mission Systems</li>\r\n<li>Advanced power systems</li>\r\n<li>Efficient Manned-Unmanned
  Teaming Constructs</li>\r\n<li>Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Autonomy</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Network
  with hardware, software, and infrastructure</strong> to provide resilient mission
  command on the move to wage the maneuver ISR, joint fires, and sustainment fights
  to retain and exploit the initiative against a peer adversary in an inherently contested
  cyber and electromagnetic environment. Potential technology areas include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Secure
  Tactical Communications</li>\r\n<li>Interoperable hardware, software, and information
  systems</li>\r\n<li>Cyber Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA)</li>\r\n<li>Assured
  Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT)</li>\r\n<li>Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance,
  and Reconnaissance (ISR)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Air and Missile Defense</strong>
  to reduce the cost curve of missile defense, restore overmatch, survive volley-fire
  attacks, and operate within sophisticated A2/AD and contested domains. Potential
  technology areas include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD)</li>\r\n<li>Smaller
  and more affordable missiles</li>\r\n<li>High Energy Lasers</li>\r\n<li>Gun-based
  counter-tactical and small unmanned air systems (UAS) capabilities</li>\r\n<li>Advanced
  seekers</li>\r\n<li>Advanced energetics and propulsion</li>\r\n<li>Next-generation
  RADARs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Soldier Lethality</strong> to improve Soldier
  and small unit performance, reduce surprise, increase protection, and enhance lethality
  in close combat on an intensely lethal and distributed battlefield and within complex,
  urban terrain. Potential technology areas include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Advanced lethality
  and projection</li>\r\n<li>Training</li>\r\n<li>Improved Soldier protection equipment</li>\r\n<li>Improved
  situational awareness and communications</li>\r\n<li>Optimized and enhanced human
  performance</li>\r\n<li>Asymmetric Vision and Decide Faster technologies</li>\r\n<li>Prolonged
  field medical care</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Medical technologies</strong> optimized
  for use in austere environments that prevent, diagnose, treat, mitigate, or cure
  servicemember health threats such as injury, polytrauma, cognitive and psychological
  stress, and infectious diseases.&nbsp; Potential medical technology areas include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Prevention
  of musculoskeletal injuries</li>\r\n<li>Immediate cardiopulmonary stabilization
  and advanced, autonomous life support</li>\r\n<li>Telehealth</li>\r\n<li>Medical
  robotics</li>\r\n<li>Diagnosis and treatment of mild traumatic brain injury</li>\r\n<li>Enhancement
  of human physical, psychological, and cognitive performance and resilience</li>\r\n<li>Suicide
  prevention</li>\r\n<li>Prompt treatment of post-traumatic stress mitigating progression
  to PTSD</li>\r\n<li>Prevention and treatment of infectious diseases</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Military
  Engineering Technologies</strong>, including 3D mapping and characteristics, cold
  regions science and engineering, and civil or military engineering applications.&nbsp;
  Potential technology areas include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Geospatial intelligence analytics</li>\r\n<li>Map-based
  mission planning</li>\r\n<li>Underground sensing</li>\r\n<li>Geo-Environmental Physics
