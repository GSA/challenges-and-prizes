description: <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) announces the 2019 Growth Accelerator Fund Competition, pursuant to the America Competes Act, to recognize the nation&rsquo;s most innovative accelerators and award them cash prizes they may use to fund their operations costs focused towards helping entrepreneurs apply for Government R&amp;D funding. Prize competition applications consist of a brief twelve-slide presentation and an optional two-minute video.</p>
    <p><strong>OVERVIEW:</strong> SBA is seeking to identify the nation's most innovative and promising small business accelerators and incubators that work with high tech entrepreneurs that are potential SBIR or STTR program applicants (see more information about SBIR/STTR below). These accelerators and incubators help entrepreneurs speed the launch, growth, and scale of their businesses and, ultimately, the creation of jobs. <strong>The Competition awards will infuse the accelerators and incubators with additional resource capital to help these entities provide focused assistance to high tech entrepreneurs, including support for company formation as well as awareness and education of the SBIR and STTR programs.</strong></p>
    <p>For the purposes of this Competition, the accelerators and incubators are referred to as Growth Accelerators (or Accelerators) and include accelerators, incubators, co-working startup communities, or other models to accomplish similar goals.</p>
    <p>SBIR and STTR refer to the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Tech Transfer programs. &nbsp;These programs provide small businesses with financial capital and research and development funds to develop high-tech, high-growth, commercially viable innovations. &nbsp;Additional information can be found at <a href="http://www.sbir.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.sbir.gov</a></p>
    <p><strong>PRIZES FOR WINNERS:</strong> In total, SBA will award up to 60 prizes of $50,000 each, for a total of up to $3 million in prizes under this announcement.</p>
