  / DESIGN REQUIREMENTS</strong></h4>\r\n<p><strong>Design a mechanical camera
  system that:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Has a field of view of 2 meter x 2
  meters at 2.5 meters from the camera (angular field of view about 60 degrees)</li>\r\n<li>Has
  a maximum pixel size of 10 mm x 10 mm (minimum resolution of 200 x 200 pixels)</li>\r\n<li>Converts
  the image into an electrical or rotational signal. This electrical or rotational
  signal must be transmitted at least 1 meter to another location, and then used
  to reconstruct the image.</li>\r\n<li>Completes the task within 5 hours.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Electronics:
  Some simple electrical components are allowed including wires, resistors, inductors,
  capacitors, <strong>one</strong> photo diode, and a maximum of <strong>one</strong>
  op amp. (High temperature photodiodes are a realistic technology that many foresee
  on the near horizon. Hence, a hybrid electro/mechanical solution is likely possible,
  using very minimal electronics.)</li>\r\n<li>Size: The entire mechanical camera
  must fit in a box 200 mm x 200 mm x 200 mm. (it is acceptable to have elements
  which extend or deploy outside of the box during operation). The box and limitations
  do not include the image reconstruction device.</li>\r\n<li>Inputs: The maximum
  number of inputs are one rotating shaft and two wires. The rotating shaft may
  be of any size, rotated at any speed, with any amount of torque desired (note,
  shaft can be connected to a motor outside of the box). One of the wires is for
  power wire and the other ground/neutral. The maximum voltage difference across
  the wires shall be 9 V or less, and a maximum current of 300 mA (i.e. essentially
  can be driven by a 9V battery).</li>\r\n<li>Outputs: The camera must provide
  outputs via either electrical signals or rotating shafts. The maximum number
  of outputs from the camera are 3 (i.e. 3 wires or 3 rotating shafts, or a combination
  of wires and rotational shafts). There are no limits on the technology that
  can be connected to the receiving end of the outputs one meter away.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Imaging
  Goal:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The camera should be able to take an image
  of a regulation size 7 basketball (9.4 to 9.55 inches in diameter) and an upright
  rectangular object (e.g. a wooden board) which is 24&rdquo; by 48&rdquo;. A
  regulation size tennis ball must be in the imaging area (2.57 to 2.70 inches
  in diameter). Objects are to be aligned 2.5 meters from the camera imaging area
  (see graphic below). Background may be any color. Exact placement of the objects
  within the frame (side to side and height) are not critical, as long as objects
  are fully in the frame and in a plane 2.5 meters from the imager.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img
  src=\"/assets/images/ids-images/5_Detailed_Challenge_Diagram.jpg\" width=\"853\"
  height=\"876\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong>Judging:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Judging
  occurs in two phases:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">&nbsp;All
  entries will be reviewed by mechanical engineers at JPL, and down selected to
  the top 6.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>The top 6 entries will then be judged by senior
  mechanical engineers and chief engineers, and feedback on those concepts will
  be provided to the submitter.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Each design
  will be judged on the following areas:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Is the concept likely
  to take a picture at the required resolution and meet the challenge requirements?
  (50%)\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Is the design likely to take an image?</li>\r\n<li>Is the
  quality of the quality of the image expected to be adequate?</li>\r\n<li>Would
  the design fit within the size requirements?</li>\r\n<li>Does the design have
  the required inputs/outputs and meet the power requirements?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Is
  the concept feasible to construct? (30%)\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Is the design something
  that could actually be constructed?</li>\r\n<li>Are there any practical limitations
  to implementing the design?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Can the concept be
  adjusted to work in Venus conditions? (20%)\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Would the concept,
  if built out of the right materials, operate at Venus&rsquo;s high temperatures?</li>\r\n<li>Would
  the concept operate at Venus pressure?</li>\r\n<li>Would the geometry be robust
  to CTE effects?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Note: Prototypes of the
  system or components are encouraged by not required.</strong> Prototypes may
  increase the score in the first two judging criteria.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Submission Requirements:</strong>&nbsp;Design
  description and blueprint must be submitted on challenge.gov website. If a prototype
  is built, a video of the prototype should be posted online with a link provided
  in the Challenge.gov submission to explain what part of the design it demonstrates.
  Videos will not be accepted via Challenge.gov.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Submission
  Due Date:</strong>&nbsp;3/31/2019 at 8:00 PM EST.&nbsp;Winners will be notified
  and announced on approximately 4 weeks later. Winning designs will be posted
  to the challenge website.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Reward:</strong> Honor, fame
  and fortune if successful! Well not so much the fortune part, but definitely
  plenty of bragging rights. The top 3 contestants will receive a unique 3D printed
  coin from the Mechanical Maker Challenge. The top winning design will also be
  provided their choice of an opportunity to visit JPL and demonstrate their design
  (as well as a tour of the facilities).</p>\r\n<h4><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong></h4>\r\n<h4><strong>OFFICIAL

  mechanical system must have a field of view 2 meter x 2 meter at 2.5 meters
  from the camera with a maximum pixel size of 10 mm x 10 mm (minimum resolution
  of 200 x 200 pixels, this is a FOV of roughly 60 degrees), and convert the image
  into an electrical or rotational signal. This electrical or rotational signal
  must be transmitted at least 1 meter to another location, and then used to reconstruct
  the image. The maximum amount of time allowed to take an image is 5 hours.</li>\r\n<li>Electronics:
  Some simple electrical components are allowed. The allowed components include
  wires, inductors, capacitors, resistors, and one photo diode. (High temperature
  photodiodes are a realistic technology that many foresee on the near horizon.
  Hence, a hybrid electro/mechanical solution is likely possible, using very minimal

  outputs via either electrical signals or rotating shafts. The maximum number
  of outputs from the camera are 3 (i.e. 3 wires or 3 rotating shafts, or a combination
  of wires and rotational shafts). If wireless communication is used, there is
  no limit on the frequency range used.</li>\r\n<li>Products: The camera must
  take an image of a regulation size 7 basketball (9.4 to 9.55 inches in diameter)
  and an upright rectangular object (e.g.&nbsp; a wooden board) which is 24&rdquo;
  by 48&rdquo;. A regulation size tennis ball must be in the imaging area (2.57
  to 2.70 inches in diameter). Objects are to be aligned 2.5 meters from the camera
  imaging area (see graphic below). Background can be any color users choice.
  Exact placement of the objects within the frame (side to side and height) are
  not critical, as long as objects are fully in the frame and in a plane 2.5 meters
  from the imager. An image with a digital camera must be taken from the same
  vantage point as the mechanical camera. This image will be used to judge image
  accuracy. Neither YouTube nor any companies affiliated with it are a sponsor

  30px;\">6. PRIZES AND APPROXIMATE RETAIL VALUES:</p>\r\n<p>The following prizes
  will be provided by Sponsors&nbsp; and awarded by Sponsors.</p>\r\n<p>One (1)
  Finalist Prize: The Finalist Prize consists of a 2-day/1-night trip for the
  winner to visit the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, demonstrate of their design,
  and give a brief presentation on the design. &nbsp;The winner must demonstrate
  their design, and give a brief presentation on their design during the trip.
  The trip includes round-trip coach air transportation from gateway airport nearest
  the Finalist&rsquo;s home and hotel accommodations (1 room, single occupancy
  or 1 room, double occupancy in the case of multiple travelers).&nbsp; The Finalist
  will also receive a 3D-printed commemorative &ldquo;Mechanical Maker Challenge
  coin.&rdquo;&nbsp; The approximate retail value (&ldquo;ARV&rdquo;) of the Prize
  is $1010. Maximum value of reimbursed travel is $1,000. Multiple individuals
  may travel, provided total reimbursed travel cost does not exceed $1,000 for
  all travelers. If multiple individuals travel, all must participate in the design
  demonstration and/or presentation. If accompanied, the Finalist and his or her
  travel companion(s) must travel together on the same itinerary and possess all
  required travel documents, including a valid photo ID, if and as applicable.
  Air transportation tickets are non-refundable/non-transferable and are not valid
  for upgrades and/or frequent flyer miles. All air transportation tickets are
  subject to the vagaries of flight variation, work stoppages and schedule or
  route changes. ARV for travel prizes may vary depending upon points of departure
  and destination and fare fluctuations. If the closest airport to a prize winner&rsquo;s
  home is in close enough proximity to prize destination city so that, as Sponsors&nbsp;&nbsp;
  may determine in their sole discretion, a flight is unnecessary, such prize
  winner will receive alternate transportation from the Sponsors&nbsp;&nbsp; with
  no further obligation to the winner. The Finalist will not receive cash or any
  other form of compensation if actual travel costs are less than the Grand Prize
  ARV in these Official Rules. Sponsors&nbsp; reserve the right to structure the
  travel route and select hotels in their sole discretion. In the event the Finalist
  (and, his/her travel companion(s)) engages in behavior that (as determined by
  Sponsors&nbsp;&nbsp; in their sole and absolute discretion) is obnoxious or
  threatening, illegal or that is intended to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass
  any other person, Sponsors&nbsp; reserve the right to terminate the trip or
  other applicable experience early, in whole or in part, and send the Finalist
  (and his or her travel companion(s)) home with no further compensation.</p>\r\n<p>If
  the Finalist is unable to participate in the Prize trip during the dates set
  forth by Sponsors , the Prize will be forfeited in its entirety. In the event
  that the Prize trip does not or cannot take place as scheduled or at all, for
  reasons including, but not limited to, scheduling conflicts, cancellations,
  postponement, an event of force majeure, or for any other reason, then the Finalist
  will not receive any compensation and such amount plus the remaining components,
  if any, of the Prize shall constitute full satisfaction of Sponsors prize obligation
  to the Prize Winner, and no other or additional compensation will be awarded.
  Excepting the preceding sentence, no cash alternative or prize substitutions
  will be allowed, except Sponsors&nbsp; reserve the right to substitute prize(s)
  of comparable value if a prize listed is unavailable for any reason.</p>\r\n<p>One
  (1) Finalist Prize is available.&nbsp; Each Finalist Prize is valued at $1010.&nbsp;
  Two (e) Semi-Finalist Prizes are available: Each Semi-Finalist Prize consists
  of a 3D-printed commemorative &ldquo;Mechanical Maker Challenge coin&rdquo;
  valued at $10.00.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">7. GENERAL RULES:
  Void where prohibited by law. All federal, state and local laws and regulations
  apply. Winners may make no substitution or transfer of prize. All federal, state
  and local taxes are the sole responsibility of winner. Not responsible for lost,
  late, misdirected, mutilated, incomplete or illegible entries.</p>\r\n<p>The
  potential Prize Winner, must sign an Affidavit of Eligibility certifying that
  the Submission is the entrant's original work, that the entrant owns the right
  to the work, that the Submission has not previously won a prize in a national
  challenge nor has been previously published in a national publication, and that
  the entrant has followed the Official Rules of the challenge, along with an
  Affidavit/Release/Prize Acceptance Form, and their travel companion must sign
  a Travel Companion Liability/Publicity Release. (collectively, the \"Prize Claim
  Documents\"). If a Prize winner fails or refuses to sign and return all Prize
  Claim Documents within seven (7) days of prize notification (or a shorter time
  if required by exigencies), the Prize winner may be disqualified and an alternate
  winner may be selected. The Prize winner's travel companion(s) must execute
  a Travel Companion Liability/Publicity Release prior to ticketing.&nbsp; At
  the Prize Provider&rsquo;s sole discretion, the Finalist and Semi-Finalists
  and Finalists may also be required to sign Prize Claim Documents.</p>\r\n<p>The
  Sponsor is not responsible if the ability to travel and visit the Jet Propulsion
  Laboratory is cancelled or delayed for any reason.&nbsp; NASA and JPL-Caltech
  are not responsible if prize provision is cancelled or delayed for any reason.</p>\r\n<p

description: "<p>With its sulfuric acid clouds, temperatures over 450&deg;C, and 92
  times the surface pressure of Earth, Venus is one of the most hostile planetary
  environments in the solar system. Prior missions have only survived hours! But an
  automaton (or clockwork mechanical robot) could solve this problem. By utilizing
  high-temperature alloys, the clockwork rover would survive for months, allowing
  it to collect and return valuable long-term science data from the surface of Venus.
  To learn more about the automaton rover, see this <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><span
  style=\"mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-theme-font: major-fareast;\"><a
  href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/automaton-rover-for-extreme-environments-aree\">link</a></span></span>.</p>\r\n<p>At
  NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, we are turning this innovative concept into
  reality under a NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) funded study. We&rsquo;ve
  been working hard on this project, but we could use YOUR help to address some of
  our toughest mechanical design challenges! The Mechanical Maker Challenges are a
  series of challenges seeking to engage YOUR creativity to invent mechanical ways
  of performing traditionally electrical tasks. Challenges will be released in series,
  one at a time.</p>\r\n<p>Our Inaugural Challenge: The Mechanical Eye</p>\r\n<p>Currently,
  there are no cameras or imagers that work for more than a few minutes at Venus temperatures.
  However, imagery is critical for both informing science and public engagement. In
  the words of Carl Sagan &ldquo;It is within our capability to land a rover on Mars
  that could scan its surroundings, see the most interesting place in its field of
  view and, by the same time tomorrow, be there. Such a mission would reap enormous
  scientific benefits, even if there is no life on Mars. Public interest in such a
  mission would be sizable. Every day a new set of vistas would arrive on our home
  television screens.&rdquo; Similarly, for Venus, imagery on a long duration rover
  is critical. The driving science goal for the mechanical, clockwork style camera
  is to take images of rocks and geologic features near the rover. This provides context
  for any samples obtained so relationships between the sample and the rest of Venus
  geology can be better understood.</p>\r\n<p>The Challenge: Design a mechanical camera
  system that:</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:
  auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;
  tab-stops: list .5in;\">Has a field of view of 2 meter x 2 meters at 2.5 meters
  from the camera (angular field of view about 60 degrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\"
  style=\"mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;
  mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;\">Has a maximum pixel size of 10
  mm x 10 mm (minimum resolution of 200 x 200 pixels).</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\"
  style=\"mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;
  mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;\">Converts the image into an electrical
  or rotational signal. This electrical or rotational signal must be transmitted at
  least 1 meter to another location, and then used to reconstruct the image.</li>\r\n<li
  class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;
  line-height: normal; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;\">Completes
  the task within 5 hours.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>What to Submit: A two-page description
  of the design as well as a blueprint illustrating how the concept works. Video demonstrations
  of working prototypes are encouraged, but not required.</p>\r\n<p>The Prize: The
  first place design will receive the experience of a trip to JPL (up to $1,000 value)
  to present their concept to mechanical engineers who work on interplanetary spacecraft.
  They will also receive a &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; tour and a 3D printed Commemorative
  Mechanical Maker Challenge Coin.</p>\r\n<p>Second and third place will get serious
  bragging rights with a 3D printed Commemorative Mechanical Maker Challenge Coin.</p>\r\n<p><img
