    <p>In the future, manufacturing will be planned out in the virtual world. How can we do this if we don&rsquo;t even have models for the basic processes such as welding, drilling, and forging? Sewing, assembly, or distillation? Nope, we don&rsquo;t even have models for those either! At least, not the types of models really needed for our high-tech world. Manufacturers need models to improve operations, to protect the environment, to share information, and to compose them into systems. Using your models will let manufacturers simulate, improve, and optimize all sorts of processes. Showcase your manufacturing research by entering the RAMP 2018 Challenge!&nbsp; Finalists will be invited to present their entries in a workshop at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asme.org/events/msec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-located ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC) 2018 and the 46th NAMRI/SME North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC)</a> in College Station, TX, on June 18-22.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Information Model:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The identified UMP information model(s) each should include an&nbsp;XML instance conforming to the new <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/UMPSchema_for_user.xsd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UMP Schema</a>. The <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/UMPSchema_for_user.xsd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UMP Schema</a>&nbsp;provides the structure necessary to meet these requirements. Please refer to the<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/UMP_Schema_Documentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UMP Schema Documentation</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>for a detailed explanation of each element and attribute in the schema.&nbsp; Within the XML instance, the following must be addressed:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Entity identification:&nbsp; Identify the five elements shown in the E3012-16 standard, including inputs, outputs, product and process information, resources, and transformation functions.</li>
    <li>Nomenclature:&nbsp; Describe the nomenclature of all recorded entities represented in the structured form, including any computed values in the transformation functions. This should include information such as names of the computed values, its meaning, type of the input variable, and the unit in which the data is represented in the model.</li>
    <li>Information sources:&nbsp; Source of the information used to define the UMP models, such as existing literature, industry case studies, and textbooks.</li>
    <li>Constraints and bounds:&nbsp; For each recorded parameter and the model itself, describe the feasibility bounds. For example, material density cannot be a value less than zero.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To support the Information Model, the submission must also include a PDF file includes the following supporting information:</p>
    <p><strong>Introductory Information</strong>:</p>
    <p>Describe information about the submission and the participants, including the title and participant information.</p>
    <p><strong>Graphical Representation</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The five elements shown in the E3012-16 standard must also be clearly identified in the graphical representation:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Inputs:&nbsp; Identify inputs, which include information about the physical inputs to the process, such energy and material.</li>
    <li>Outputs:&nbsp; Identify outputs, which include information about the physical outputs of the process, such as waste and finished parts.</li>
    <li>Product and Process Information:&nbsp; Identify the necessary product and process information that would be required to instantiate the transformation functions, such as CAD files, CAM files, technical drawings, and specifications sheets.</li>
    <li>Resources:&nbsp; Identify specific manufacturing assets, such as machines, tools, and operators, that would be required to instantiate the transformation functions.</li>
    <li>Transformation Functions:&nbsp; Describe a series of equations that compute the output from the input.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note:&nbsp; The Graphical Representation should match the XML instance as specified in the Information Model.&nbsp; The purpose of the Graphical Representation is for presentation and communication.&nbsp; If there are multiple UMPs submitted, a graphical representation for each UMP must be prepared.</p>
    <p><strong>Written Narrative</strong>:</p>
    <p>Describe in less than 1500 words how your entry meets the judging criteria and addresses this year's theme, Tracking Resources and Flows through the System.&nbsp; The written narrative should address the following topics.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Validation:&nbsp; Explain how the model is validated. An example of validation includes procuring the data (i.e., inputs and outputs) from a physical (or virtual) manufacturing setting and validating this output against the computed output from the transformation function that is run with inputs from the real manufacturing setting. Other approaches may be taken.</li>
    <li>Novelty of UMP representation in addressing the Theme.&nbsp; This can be demonstrated through the following:&nbsp;
    <ul>
    <li>Advancements to knowledge and understanding of UMP modeling through innovative and expressive representations and methodologies, novel formal representations, more accurate or specialized metric, metric representations that support cascading to higher production levels, or exploration of variations for families of UMP models.</li>
    <li>Advancements to standards supporting reuse models. This may include automated methods that allow linking of UMP models into systems, facilitating system composition through naming conventions or other methods, generalization that unifies a collection of processes, or standards-based methods for integration with applications.</li>
    <li>Advancement of techniques for development and validation of UMP models. This may include demonstration of validation techniques for the effectiveness and accuracy of the UMP models or techniques for producing useful derivatives of UMP models or creative methods for mining documentary model descriptions into formal representations.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Directions for submission:&nbsp; </strong></p>
    <p>Multiple files may be submitted, but should be uploaded as a single file submission, as a ZIP file.&nbsp; To clarify, your ZIP file should include XML documents for each UMP model and a PDF of the supporting information.</p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>ENTRY PROCESS</strong></span></p>
    <p>To enter, the participant must create an account at challenge.gov and visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ramp-reusable-abstractions-of-manufacturing-processes/">Event Website</a>.

<p><strong><u>GUIDELINES FOR YOUR SUBMISSION</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Manufacturing Process Selection:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>You can choose any manufacturing process(es)&nbsp;to demonstrate the application of a UMP representation using ASTM E3012-16 and in support of the theme.&nbsp; ASTM is providing access to this standard free of charge for the purpose of the RAMP Challenge. To obtain a copy of the standard for use in the RAMP Challenge, you can click <a href="https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.astm.org%2Fnist-ramp&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckevin.lyons%40nist.gov%7C81ab8bbf82f24ce2a2c608d536825246%7C2ab5d82fd8fa4797a93e054655c61dec%7C1%7C0%7C636474857162099167&amp;sdata=ePHyZgKeg0bpOSAEqvWabABmh1zEbdcHrwTf8LWpLvE%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The standard is further described in a Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering paper titled &ldquo;Standard representations for sustainability characterization of industrial processes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The paper may be downloaded&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nist.gov/node/1090636" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Information Model:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The identified UMP information model(s) each should include an&nbsp;XML instance conforming to the new <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/UMPSchema_for_user.xsd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UMP Schema</a>. The <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/UMPSchema_for_user.xsd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UMP Schema</a>&nbsp;provides the structure necessary to meet these requirements. Please refer to the<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/UMP_Schema_Documentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UMP Schema Documentation</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>for a detailed explanation of each element and attribute in the schema.&nbsp; Within the XML instance, the following must be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entity identification: Identify the five elements shown in the E3012-16 standard, including inputs, outputs, product and process information, resources, and transformation functions.</li>
<li>Nomenclature: Describe the nomenclature of all recorded entities represented in the structured form, including any computed values in the transformation functions. This should include information such as names of the computed values, its meaning, type of the input variable, and the unit in which the data is represented in the model.</li>
<li>Information sources: Source of the information used to define the UMP models, such as existing literature, industry case studies, and textbooks.</li>
<li>Constraints and bounds: For each recorded parameter and the model itself, describe the feasibility bounds. For example, material density cannot be a value less than zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>To support the Information Model, the submission must also include a PDF file includes the following supporting information:</p>
<p><strong>Introductory Information</strong>:</p>
<p>Describe information about the submission and the participants, including the title and participant information.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Representation</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The five elements shown in the E3012-16 standard must also be clearly identified in the graphical representation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inputs: Identify inputs, which include information about the physical inputs to the process, such energy and material.</li>
<li>Outputs: Identify outputs, which include information about the physical outputs of the process, such as waste and finished parts.</li>
<li>Product and Process Information: Identify the necessary product and process information that would be required to instantiate the transformation functions, such as CAD files, CAM files, technical drawings, and specifications sheets.</li>
<li>Resources: Identify specific manufacturing assets, such as machines, tools, and operators, that would be required to instantiate the transformation functions.</li>
<li>Transformation Functions: Describe a series of equations that compute the output from the input.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The Graphical Representation should match the XML instance as specified in the Information Model.&nbsp; The purpose of the Graphical Representation is for presentation and communication.&nbsp; If there are multiple UMPs submitted, a graphical representation for each UMP must be prepared.</p>
<p><strong>Written Narrative</strong>:</p>
<p>Describe in less than 1500 words how your entry meets the judging criteria and addresses this year's theme, Tracking Resources and Flows through the System.&nbsp; The written narrative should address the following topics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Validation: Explain how the model is validated. An example of validation includes procuring the data (i.e., inputs and outputs) from a physical (or virtual) manufacturing setting and validating this output against the computed output from the transformation function that is run with inputs from the real manufacturing setting. Other approaches may be taken.</li>
<li>Novelty of UMP representation in addressing the Theme.&nbsp; This can be demonstrated through the following:
<ul>
<li>Advancements to knowledge and understanding of UMP modeling through innovative and expressive representations and methodologies, novel formal representations, more accurate or specialized metric, metric representations that support cascading to higher production levels, or exploration of variations for families of UMP models.</li>
<li>Advancements to standards supporting reuse models. This may include automated methods that allow linking of UMP models into systems, facilitating system composition through naming conventions or other methods, generalization that unifies a collection of processes, or standards-based methods for integration with applications.</li>
<li>Advancement of techniques for development and validation of UMP models. This may include demonstration of validation techniques for the effectiveness and accuracy of the UMP models or techniques for producing useful derivatives of UMP models or creative methods for mining documentary model descriptions into formal representations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions for submission: </strong></p>
<p>Multiple files may be submitted, but should be uploaded as a single file submission, as a ZIP file.&nbsp; To clarify, your ZIP file should include XML documents for each UMP model and a PDF of the supporting information.</p>
<p><span><strong>ENTRY PROCESS</strong></span></p>
<p>To enter, the participant must create an account at challenge.gov and visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ramp-reusable-abstractions-of-manufacturing-processes/">Event Website</a>. Entries sent to NIST in any manner other than through the Event Website will not be evaluated or considered for award.<img class="alignright wp-image-165895 size-medium" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/figure_gripping_cordless_drill_1600_clr_14311-169x300.png" alt="" width="169" height="300" /></p>
<p><strong>Model types:</strong></p>
<p>Any manufacturing process can be modeled for purposes of information sharing and sustainability assessment.&nbsp; The modeled process can be one that you have uniquely studied, or from open literature or other 3rd party sources. Any size scale and manufacturing process type (batch, continuous, and discrete event) is acceptable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entry processes can span sizes from traditional scale down to nano-scale and be based on mechanical, electrical, chemical, biochemical, and bio technologies. Note that sustainability is a balance of competing objectives, including cost and time as well as environmental considerations, so many different types of process performance metrics may be considered.&nbsp; In addition, the use of the models for system-level sustainability performance is a focus of this year's competition.</p>
<p><strong>Entries Allowed:</strong> Multiple entries are permitted. Each entry will be reviewed independently. Each entry must characterize at least one process yet participants can submit more than one model per entry. The participant must submit an analysis of a Unit Manufacturing Process that uses the <a href="https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.astm.org%2Fnist-ramp&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckevin.lyons%40nist.gov%7C81ab8bbf82f24ce2a2c608d536825246%7C2ab5d82fd8fa4797a93e054655c61dec%7C1%7C0%7C636474857162099167&amp;sdata=ePHyZgKeg0bpOSAEqvWabABmh1zEbdcHrwTf8LWpLvE%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASTM E60.13 E3012-16 Standard Guide for Characterizing Environmental Aspects of Manufacturing Processes</a>, and that meets the criteria described herein.</p>
