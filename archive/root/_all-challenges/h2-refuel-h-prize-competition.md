rules: '<h4>H2 Refuel H-Prize Guidelines</h4><p>   <p><strong> Introduction</strong> Fuel
  cells powered by hydrogen from renewable or low-carbon resources can lead to
  substantial energy savings and reductions in imported petroleum and carbon emissions.
  Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) are much more efficient than today’s gasoline
  vehicles, and when fueled with hydrogen, produce only water vapor at the tailpipe.
  The hydrogen fuel can be generated from a range of domestic sources. While the
  commercial sale of FCEVs is rapidly approaching, infrastructure remains a major
  challenge, with only approximately 50 fueling stations in the United States,
  only 10 of which are operating as public stations.</p><p>The H-Prize was authorized
  under section 654 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (Pub.
  L. 110-140). As efforts to build a hydrogen fueling station infrastructure are
  getting underway, the H2 Refuel H-Prize is intended to incentivize the development
  of small-scale systems for non-commercial fueling to supplement the larger-scale
  infrastructure development.</p><p>The H2 Refuel H-Prize anticipates award of a
  $1 million prize to the top refueler system entry that can produce hydrogen
  using electricity and/or natural gas, energy sources commonly available to residential
  locations, and dispense the hydrogen to a vehicle, providing at least 1 kg per
  refueling. Systems considered would be at the home scale and able to generate
  and dispense 1-5 kg H<sub>2</sub>/day for use at residences, or the medium scale,
  generating and dispensing 5-50 kg H<sub>2</sub>/day. Medium scale systems would
  serve a larger community with multiple users daily, such as a large apartment
  complex or retail centers to fuel small fleets of vehicles (e.g., light duty
  automobiles, forklifts or tractors).</p><p>Interested parties can register and
  find more information, updates and pages where teams can discuss the prize at
  the H-Prize website: <a href="http://hydrogenprize.org/">http://hydrogenprize.org</a>.
  The Hydrogen Education Foundation (HEF) is currently administering the prize
  for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and DOE will coordinate prize activities
  with HEF.</p><p>Teams will have a year to design a system that generates and dispenses
  hydrogen fuel that meets the criteria and identify a location where it can be
  installed and used. Twelve months after the competition opens, teams will be
  required to complete registration and submit system designs and blue prints,
  plans for installation, and preliminary data to demonstrate that the system
  satisfies the minimum criteria (see Criteria section). Teams will also need
  to provide documented evidence of cooperation from the installation site. Of
  the teams that meet all of the minimum criteria, the top entries will be selected
  as finalists to enter the testing phase. The selected teams will then have seven
  months to install and begin operating their systems. The systems must be compatible
  with remote monitoring equipment to allow remote monitoring for the testing
  period; compatibility requirements will be posted on the H-Prize website. Starting
  21 months after the competition opens, the finalist systems will be remotely
  monitored and tested, and approximately two months of data will be collected.
  At least one on-site visit will be performed to verify data and perform tests
  that cannot be done remotely. Teams must also provide requested information
  to a DOE designated entity for independent verification of the cost of the system
  and the cost of the generated hydrogen. The scoring criteria will be ranked
  and weighted.    </p><p><strong>Proposed Timeline</strong></p><p>  <table>  <tbody>  <tr>  <td

  criteria and testing</strong></p><p>  <strong>Finalist selection phase</strong>    Twelve
  months after the competition opens, teams interested in competing must have
  completed registering for the competition and submit all required information.
  To be considered, an entry must meet the initial selection criteria defined
  below. Teams will be required to submit data that demonstrates the system’s
  ability to meet the indicated criteria. The top teams to provide convincing
  evidence that the entry could satisfy the minimum criteria will be selected
  for testing. Specific instructions will be posted on the H-Prize website detailing
  the required information. In addition to the required technical criteria data,
  teams will submit system descriptions and preliminary designs and installation
  concepts which will be evaluated by an expert panel to determine if the entries
  are likely to meet reasonable usability, cost and safety criteria. Usability
  refers to the ability of the system to be installed and used at the intended
  locations (e.g., considering footprint and noise), and to be easily operated
  by the average user (e.g., with minimum training and time). Because a goal of
  the H-Prize is to advance commercial applications of hydrogen energy technologies,
  the potential of the systems to ultimately be commercialized will also be evaluated,
  and a description of a pathway to commercial production of the systems, including
  manufacturing, will be requested. To evaluate the potential safety of the system,
  certain information will be requested, including a safety plan and a hazard
  analysis; specific instructions will be available at the H-Prize website. A
  safety page on the H-Prize website will provide updated information on safety
  issues and requirements for the safety plan and hazard analysis. To be selected
  as a finalist, contestant designs, installation details and safety plans must
  be judged adequately safe by a panel of safety professionals.    </p><p><strong>Minimum/Maximum

  competition</strong>    The finalist teams will have seven months to install
  their systems at a location of their choosing before testing begins. Among other
  considerations, entries must meet the safety codes and standards in effect at
  the installation location appropriate to the system. Further, all required permits
  and approvals must be received prior to system operations.    Each entry will
  be scored in six different technical and cost criteria:    <br>- Dispensing
  pressure    <br>- Dispensing time    <br>- Number of standard fills per day    <br>-
  Tested availability    <br>- Total installed system cost    <br>- Direct user
  cost per kg    The criteria and scoring ranges are listed in more detail below.    Testing
  for the technical criteria will be performed remotely over a period of 2 to
  3 months, with at least one on-site inspection to verify data and perform testing
  that cannot be done remotely. Summary level testing results will be published.
  The base criteria listed in Minimum/Maximum Criteria Table will be tested to
  ensure that all entries meet those requirements. A standard fill is defined
  as the delivery of 1 kg of hydrogen to a vehicle tank.    The cost criteria
  will be evaluated by an independent auditing entity. Teams will be required
  to submit cost information, such as the bill of materials for the system installation
  and system operating costs during the testing period. Specific details on required
  information will be provided to finalist teams after selection.    Entries will
  receive scores for the tested criteria as described below, with different multipliers
  for each of the criteria. When testing is complete, the data will be analyzed
  to determine scores. Once all results have been analyzed, judges will evaluate
  the results and determine the scores based on the published scoring criteria,
  and confirm entry eligibility based on the base criteria and eligibility requirements.
  After resolving any ties (see tie resolution process below), the eligible team
  with the highest score will be the winner.   </p><p> <strong>Installation site criteria</strong>    Any
  site in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia can be used for the
  installation of the refueler, as long as there is access for installing equipment
  for remote monitoring, at least one on-site visit for in-depth testing, and
  at least one visit by the press and public.    To meet testing requirements,
  the fueling system should be used at an average of at least 50% planned capacity
  per week (e.g., for a home system designed to dispense 1 kg/day, at least four
  1-kg “fills” per week; for a community system designed to produce 20 kg/day,
  it should dispense at least 70 1-kg “fills” per week). If on-site use is below
  this level, simulated fills can be used for testing. Simulated fill protocols
  will be posted on the H-Prize website before testing begins.    Entries must
  meet the safety codes and standards in effect at the installation location.
  Teams are encouraged to consider the relevant SAE, ASME and NFPA codes and standards.<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>    </p><p><strong>Prize
  criteria</strong>  The criteria were developed through discussion with experts
  in the field, including members of Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technical Advisory
  Committee, other DOE offices, and federal agencies, and from responses to a
  Request for Information (DE-FOA-0000907: RFI - Home Hydrogen Refueler H-Prize
  Topic,http://www1.eere.energy.gov/financing/solicitations_detail.html?sol_id=600)
  and public comments on the draft criteria (79 FR 15737).    Each of the criteria
  is assigned a 1-5 point scale connected to different ranges. To be eligible,
  entries must receive at least the minimum score for each category. For some
  criteria, the ranges for home and community systems may be different. A score
  multiplying factor will be used to weight the different criteria.    &nbsp;  <table>  <tbody>  <tr>  <td

  kg/day with a system installed cost of $24,000 would score 1 point, while a
  system designed to dispense 2 kg/day at the same cost would receive a score
  of 3. Teams will be expected to provide information such as the bill of materials
  for all components. Details of the specific information requested will be provided
  to the teams selected for testing. If the system proposed provides heat and/or
  power in addition to hydrogen for refueling, the cost of the entire system will

  cost per kg will be based on feedstock inputs and actual operations and maintenance
  costs during the testing period, divided by the amount of hydrogen that is produced
  and used. The direct user cost per kg excludes the capital and installation
  costs, which are included in the total installed system cost category. Feedstock
  cost inputs will be based on actual usage, using a single price for all entries
  for each input to eliminate regional variation, based on the EIA 2014 projections
  for average price to all users: $0.098/kWh for electricity and $6.60/million
  BTU for natural gas. All generated and used hydrogen is counted in determining
  the $/kg – for example, a system that generates 10 kg/day, where 4 kg is used
  for fuel vehicles and 5 is used in a fuel cell to produce power would divide
  the daily user costs by 9.    <strong>Scoring</strong>  <table>  <tbody>  <tr>  <td

  and testing</strong>    A panel of independent judges will be assembled from
  experts in relevant fields, selected by DOE in consultation with HEF. Judges
  may be selected from organizations such as the Hydrogen Safety Panel, the Hydrogen
  and Fuel Cells Technical Advisory Committee, National Labs, and relevant federal
  agencies. An independent testing entity will be selected to perform remote and
  on-site technical data collection, and an independent auditing oversight entity
  will collect and analyze the cost data.    <strong>Tie resolution process</strong>    If
  the results for any of the technical criteria for different entries differ by
  less than the measurement error range, then those systems will be considered
  tied for that category and given the higher of the two scores (for example,
  if the pressure measurement error range is 5%, and Entry A has a dispensing
  pressure of 499 bar and Entry B has a pressure of 500 bar, both will be given
  3 points for the category).    If the top entries’ total scores are tied, the
  entry with the highest measured pressure will win; if the pressure measurements
  are within the measurement error, the entry with the highest measured availability
  will be selected as the winner. Otherwise, the entry with the highest score
  will win. <p><strong> Competition requirements and process</strong></p><p>  <strong>Eligibility
