  Although the VA engages with over 9 million Veterans, there are currently 17.4
  million Veterans in the United States. Even Veterans who do receive VA care
  may not be in regular contact. We want to ensure the VA serves all veterans,
  and there may be ways to promote well-being, enhance preventative care,
  predict future hospitalizations, or monitor chronic conditions for this
  population. All of these interventions are aimed at improving outcomes for our
  Veterans.


  We invite interested solvers to participate in a three-month AI Tech Sprint. The sprint is an iterative prototyping process where outside teams will receive novel synthetic data and connect with health care providers, experts, and stakeholders from the Department of Veterans Affairs. We will work with each team to craft a suitable project that fits the team’s abilities and improves VA care. Teams will participate in weekly meetings with government experts and researchers, and monthly opportunities to demonstrate a prototype. The tech sprint culminates in a demo day, where participants receive recognition from the VA as well as $100,000 in total awards. 


  Select projects may also receive offers to pilot their product with VA hospitals, the largest health care system in the United States. We seek to establish collaborative public-private partnerships beyond the challenge window and facilitate the production of contract-ready solutions for improving Veterans’ care.


  Applications are due Dec 16, 2020, with the tech sprint kickoff on Jan 4, 2021, and final demo day on April 2, 2021.

  **Non-monetary Prizes**


  * Formal recognition at a Demo Day event hosted by the NAII

  * Early access to a novel synthetic dataset from the VA

  * Contact with experts and researchers in the federal government


  Furthermore, if the government determines that the entire project has been successfully completed, there continues to be a need, and there is available funding; you and the VA or any VA component may attempt to negotiate one or more new agreements for the following purposes as authorized by law:


  * Follow-on prototype research and development (R&D) contract, Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), or Other Transactions Agreement (OTA) as authorized by law and applicable VA or VA component policy.

  * Follow-on agreement for limited use of one or more completed prototypes in the VA environment for test purposes for a minimum of up to one year; as authorized by applicable law and VA or VA component policy.

  * Follow-on production purchase agreement in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, FAR 6.204, Section 538 of Division F of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Public Law 115-141); or as otherwise authorized by applicable law and VA or VA component policy.
