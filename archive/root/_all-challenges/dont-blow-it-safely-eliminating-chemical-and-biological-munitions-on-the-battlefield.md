  and use of chemical weapons on the battlefield and in targeted attacks is on the
  rise. Destruction of such weapons presents numerous technical challenges and existing
  solutions &ndash; such as blowing it up &ndash; aren't always appropriate for use.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"Don't
  Blow It!\" is an industry competition jointly sponsored and funded by the U.S. Department
  of Defense and UK Ministry of Defence and administered by the UK's Defence and Security
  Accelerator (DASA). The goal of the competition is to identify novel and innovative
  technologies and approaches to access, disable and/or irreversibly destroy chemical
  and biological munitions, improvised explosive devices, and bulk agents on the battlefield
  or in other austere environments. </em></p>\r\n<p>This Defence and Security Accelerator
  (DASA) competition is seeking proposals for novel and innovative technologies and
  approaches to access, disable and/or irreversibly destroy chemical and biological
  munitions, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and bulk agents in challenging environments.</p>\r\n<p>The
  competition has an initial &pound;500,000 to fund multiple proof-of-concept proposals
  at low Technology Readiness Levels (TRL). Additional funding of &pound;1.5 million
  may be available depending on the outcome of the initial funding phase. The competition
  will launch at an event in London on the 26 September 2018.</p>\r\n<p>It is joint
  funded by the UK Ministry of Defence and the US Department of Defense, and will
  operate under an existing memorandum of understanding between both nations. Under
  the Chemical Weapons Convention all member states are obligated to destroy any chemical
  weapons they own or possess, or that they abandoned on the territory of another
  member state.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: Arial,

  is an increasing focus on developing a toolkit of novel and innovative options to
  enable rapid, effective and irreversible destruction of smaller caches of chemical
  and biological weapons discovered in resource-limited environments.</p>\r\n<p>Whilst
  destruction technologies exist, they are not appropriate for use in all circumstances.
  Through this competition we want to investigate novel or innovative new concepts
  or adapt current technologies. We expect these solutions will ultimately enable
  destruction methods to be more rapid, effective and flexible than those used for
  large stockpiles, and reduce logistical support requirements, whilst maximising
  ease of operation, transportability and ruggedness of the equipment. These improved
  capabilities will allow us to address a greater breadth of threats and in a wider
  range of circumstances.</p>\r\n<p>There are three main areas of interest for this
  competition:</p>\r\n<p>Access</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>how to gain access to munitions,
  IEDs and bulk containers without relying on the original design features, such as
  filling ports, which may or may not be present</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Disable</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>how
  to prevent munitions, IEDs and bulk agent being used as intended either temporarily
  or permanently</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Destroy</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>how to permanently
  and irreversibly destroy munitions, IEDs and bulk agents</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Key
  limitations of the traditional destruction technologies include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>significant
  logistical burden (large equipment footprint (a facility)), difficult to transport
  (size, weight), resource intensive (such as requiring large amounts of electricity
  or water);</li>\r\n<li>manpower intensive (significant set-up time, manually operated);</li>\r\n<li>low
  throughput and not designed for small-diameter or irregularly shaped items;</li>\r\n<li>large
  quantities of waste generated.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We're seeking novel and innovative
  technologies and approaches that will overcome these limitations and enhance the
  range of tools available for dealing with these devices. We're not anticipating
  a one-size-fits-all solution and envisage that the proposed approaches will result
  in a set of tools capable of addressing a range of problems. We expect that they
  will ultimately enable destruction methods to be more rapid, effective and flexible
  than those used for large stockpiles, and reduce logistical support requirements,
  whilst maximising ease of operation, transportability and ruggedness of the equipment.</p>\r\n<p>We're
  looking for new or improved capabilities that are adaptable to varying munition
  and container sizes and shapes, have higher throughput and can destroy a range of
  devices either in situ or with minimum displacement.&nbsp; The solution does not
  necessarily need to be reusable &ndash; it could be a sacrificial single-use approach.&nbsp;
  Your proposed technical solution must minimise the impact of any hazardous materials
  generated.</p>\r\n<p>We are also interested in proposals that develop existing technologies
  from other fields in a scalable and novel way.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Challenges</strong></p>\r\n<p>This
  call has three challenges. Your proposal must address one or more of these challenges.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Challenge
  1: Access &ndash; We are looking for novel and innovative technologies and approaches
  that can access munitions, IEDs and containers of bulk agent without relying on
  the original design features, such as filling ports, which may or may not be present.
  (A filling port is an access hole into a&nbsp;<a style=\"color: #4c2c92; border:

  rel=\"external\">container</a>&nbsp;that enables it to be filled or drained)</li>\r\n<li>Challenge
  2: Disable &ndash; We are seeking novel and innovative technologies and approaches
  that prevent munitions, IEDs and bulk agent being used as intended. This could be
  by delaying their deployment to such a degree that it prevents their imminent use.
  Your proposed technology or approach must prevent these munitions, IEDs or bulk
  agent from being used for their intended purpose either temporarily or, if possible,
  permanently</li>\r\n<li>Challenge 3: Destroy &ndash; We are looking for novel and
  innovative technologies and approaches that permanently and irreversibly destroy
  munitions, IEDs and bulk agent</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The devices to be accessed, disabled
  or destroyed may be munitions, IEDs or containers filled with chemical or biological
  agents. The munitions may be as large as 175mm&nbsp;<a style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color:

  could be unstable. The IEDs may be irregularly shaped and may also contain explosive
  materials. The containers may hold up to 1 metric tonne of bulk chemical or biological
  agent. The&nbsp;<a style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); border:

  or solids.</p>\r\n<p>We are seeking solutions which are readily transportable and
  satisfy one of two conditions:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Man-portable &ndash; the system
  and consumables fit in two standard military backpacks, and can be carried by two
  people</li>\r\n<li>Mobile &ndash; the system and consumables must not exceed the&nbsp;<a

  rel=\"external\">NATO 463L pallet size</a>&nbsp;and should be transportable by vehicle
  (land or air)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Ideally your solution would be capable of disabling
  or destroying up to one metric tonne of bulk chemical or biological agent and/or
  up to 48 munitions (as large as 175mm calibre) within 12 hours (in hostile territory)
  or 72 hours (in non-hostile territory), inclusive of equipment set-up and tear-down
  time.</p>\r\n<p>These are the aspirational targets for the final solution. Phase
  1 proposals that demonstrate proof-of-concept but are heavier, larger or have lower
  throughputs will be considered if there is a credible plan to increase throughput
  and/or reduce size/weight in potential later phases.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:

  Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\" />It is important that over the lifetime
  of DASA competitions, ideas are accelerated towards appropriate end-users, to enhance
  capability. How long this takes will be dependent on the nature and starting point
  of the innovation. Early identification and appropriate engagement with potential
  users during the competition and subsequent phases is essential. All proposals to
  DASA should articulate the development in TRL of the output over the lifetime of
  the contract and how this relates to improved operational capability. For this competition
  it is envisaged that proposals will start at a minimum of TRL 2. The deliverables
  in your proposal (especially the final proof-of-concept demonstration) should be
  designed to provide evidence that you have reached the intended TRL (at least TRL
  3) by the end of the contract. The final proof-of-concept demonstration should evidence
  that full development of the solution would indeed provide improved operational
  capability to the user. Subsequent phases, if applicable, will focus on TRL &gt;3.
  The evidence generated during Phase 1 should support the development of your potential
  bid(s) for Phase 2, with the aim of making it as easy as possible for potential
  collaborators to identify the innovative elements of your proposal in order to consider
  routes for exploitation / transition. It is important right from the start that
  DASA and end users understand how your idea will deliver longer term improvements
  to defence and/or security capability and how it could be integrated with other
  relevant capabilities. Therefore, you may wish to include some of the following
  information, where known, to help the assessors understand your exploitation / transition
  plans:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the intended defence and/or security users of your final
  product and whether you have engaged with these end-users or their procurement organisation</li>\r\n<li>the
  current TRL of the innovation and where you realistically think it will be by the
  end of Phase 1</li>\r\n<li>awareness of, and alignment to, any existing end user
  procurement programmes</li>\r\n<li>the anticipated benefits (for example, in cost,
  time or improved capability) that your solution will provide to the user</li>\r\n<li>whether
  it is likely to be a standalone product or integrated with other technologies or
  platforms</li>\r\n<li>expected additional work required beyond the end of the contract
  to develop an operationally deployable commercial products (for example, &lsquo;scaling
  up&rsquo; for manufacture, cyber security, integration with existing technologies
  or environmental operating conditions)</li>\r\n<li>additional future applications
  and markets for exploitation / transition</li>\r\n<li>wider collaborations and networks
  you have already developed or any additional relationships you see as a requirement
  to support exploitation / transition</li>\r\n<li>requirements for access Government
  Furnished Assets (GFA) for example data, equipment, materials and facilities (noting
  we cannot guarantee the availability of GFA)</li>\r\n<li>how you intend to demonstrate
  the outputs at the end of this phase, what form the proof-of-concept demonstration
  would take and whether it will require any special facilities (for example, outdoor
  space, specific venue)</li>\r\n<li>how your product could be tested in a representative
  environment in later phases</li>\r\n<li>any specific legal, commercial or regulatory
  considerations for exploitation / transition.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>How to
  apply</strong></p>\r\n<p>Proposals for funding to meet these challenges must be

  with clear milestones and deliverables must also be provided. Deliverables must
  be well defined and designed to provide evidence of progress against the project
  plan and the end-point for this phase. Please provide details in your proposal how
  you intend to demonstrate the functionality and capability of your development,
  including any materials you plan to use to represent the threat materials. A resourcing
  plan must also be provided that identifies, where possible, the nationalities of
  those proposed Research Workers that you intend working on this phase. In the event
  of proposals being recommended for funding, the DASA reserves the right to undertake
  due diligence checks including the clearance of proposed Research Workers. Please
  note that this process will take as long as necessary and could take up to 6 weeks
  in some cases for non-UK nationals. You must identify any ethical/legal/regulatory/environmental
  factors within your proposal and how the associated risks will be managed, including
  break points in the project if approvals are not received. Further details are available

  exchange of proposals, prototypes and associated information between the UK and
  US governments. However, this effective exemption from export controls only applies
  to the UK and US, not to third countries, and all bidders must therefore abide by
  the export control requirements of their originator country. All relevant export
  control regulations will apply if a company ultimately wants to sell a developed
  solution to a foreign entity. All bidders must ensure that they can obtain, if required,
  the necessary export licences for their proposals and developments, such that they
  can be supplied to the UK and US. If you cannot confirm that you can gain the requisite
  licences, your proposal will be sifted out of the competition. Additionally, if
  the project board believes that you will not be able to obtain export clearance,
  additional checks may be conducted, which may also result in your proposal being
  sifted out of the competition.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Specific to U.S. applicants:</strong>&nbsp;
  U.S. bidders must obtain the proper requisite export license before submitting technical
  information to the DASA.&nbsp; The Department of State's Directorate of Defense
  Trade Controls (DDTC) has been advised of the competition and is prepared to facilitate
  rapid processing of these licenses.&nbsp; In addition, bidders are strongly encouraged
  to review relevant export control sections of the International Traffic in Arms
  Regulations (ITAR), to ascertain if any sections pertain to the requested activity,
  noting that recent amendments expedite processing of licenses for export to the
  UK.&nbsp; Pertinent information should be referenced in the applicant&rsquo;s transmittal
  letter and in Block 20 (Purpose) of the permanent export license form (DSP-5) before
  submitting application to the DDTC.&nbsp; The bidder may wish to review the guidelines
  for an export license request prior to submission.&nbsp; This information can be
  found on the DDTC website: www.pmddtc.state.gov.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Public-facing
  information</strong></p>\r\n<p>A brief abstract will be requested if the proposal
  is funded. This will be used by DASA and other government departments as appropriate,
  to describe the project and its intended outcomes and benefits. It will be used
  for inclusion at DASA events in relation to this competition and placed on the DASA
  website, along with your company information and generic contact details.</p>\r\n<p>All
  proposals will be assessed in accordance with the standard&nbsp;<a style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color:

  assessment criteria</a>&nbsp;All proposals will be checked for compliance with the
  competition document and may be rejected before sifting or full assessment if they
  do not comply. In addition, we may undertake a pre-sift of proposals based on the
  competition scope and the standard DASA assessment criteria.</p>\r\n<p>Proposals
  will then be assessed by subject matter experts from the MOD (including Dstl), other
  government departments, front-line military commands as well as and US governments
  and US Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contractors. Suppliers
  will not have the opportunity to comment on assessors comments.</p>\r\n<p>DASA reserves
  the right to disclose on a confidential basis any information it receives from bidders
  during the procurement process (including information identified by the bidder as
  Commercially Sensitive Information in accordance with the provisions of this competition)
  to any third party engaged by DASA for the specific purpose of evaluating or assisting
  DASA in the evaluation of the bidder&rsquo;s proposal. In providing such information
  the bidder consents to such disclosure. Appropriate confidentiality agreements will
  be put in place.</p>\r\n<p>After assessment, proposals will be discussed internally
  at a Decision Conference where, based on the assessments, budget and wider strategic
  considerations, a decision will be made on the proposals that are recommended for
  funding.</p>\r\n<p>Proposals that are unsuccessful will receive brief feedback after
  the Decision Conference.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Things you should know about DASA contracts</strong></p>\r\n<p>Please

  terms and conditions</a>&nbsp;which contain important information for suppliers.
  For this competition we will be using the Short Form Contract (SFC).</p>\r\n<p>Funded
  projects will be allocated a Technical Partner, either from the US, UK or both.
  The Technical Partners will work with the supplier, acting as a technical reviewer
  of the deliverables and providing an interface between the UK and US stakeholder
  communities. Additionally, an Exploitation Partner will be assigned from DASA who
  will provide transition support to the supplier as the project progresses.</p>\r\n<p>Deliverables
  from DASA contracts will be made available to UK MOD, US DoD, front-line commands,
  and may be subject to review by relevant government departments.</p>\r\n<p>The full-rights
  outputs of funded work may be exposed to international government partners. This
  is to promote international collaboration and to give projects the best chance of
  exploitation / transition through exposure to a larger scope of requirements. This
  will only be done under the protection of existing inter-governmental memoranda
  of understanding.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Supporting event</strong></p>\r\n<p>On the 9
  October 2018, between 13:00 and 18:00 BST, we will be holding a series of 20 minute
  one-to-one teleconference sessions, giving you the opportunity to ask specific questions.
