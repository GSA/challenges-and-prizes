description: "<p>Women who are pregnant or new mothers struggling with Opioid Use
  Disorder face a variety of barriers in obtaining safe and effective care and treatment.
  Women and families in rural and under-resourced communities are particularly affected.
  Barriers may include but are not limited to:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n<li>limited
  access to:<br />\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n<li>local providers with both the training
  and capacity to meet patient treatment and recovery needs;</li>\r\n<li>family-centered,
  trauma-informed treatment and recovery approaches that include integrated supports;</li>\r\n<li>adequate
  care and long-term supports for infants born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>significant
  stigma, prejudice, and discrimination which may hamper seeking treatment;</li>\r\n<li>interactions
  with the criminal justice system; and</li>\r\n<li>limited social supports such as
  transportation, safe housing, and employment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The Addressing
  Opioid Use Disorder in Pregnant Women and New Moms Challenge will award $375,000
  in prizes to support tech innovations to improve access to quality health care,
  including substance use disorder treatment, recovery, and support services for pregnant
  women with opioid use disorders, their infants, and families, especially those in
  rural and geographically isolated areas.</p>"
