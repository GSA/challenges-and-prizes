description: "<p><span lang=\"EN\">In this Challenge, we are seeking insightful essays
  from U.S. high school students, aged 16 &ndash; 18, that describe a teen&rsquo;s
  understanding of a specific mental health issue and ideas that can promote better
  health and well-being in their communities with a particular emphasis on communicating
  with parents, peers, school leaders, policy makers, and health professionals.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">Based on diagnostic interview data from the National Comorbidity Survey
  Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A) the lifetime prevalence of any mental disorders among
  U.S. adolescents aged 15-16 and 17-18 is 49.3% and 56.7% respectively and an estimated
  49.5% of adolescents had some type of mental disorder, with 22.2% having severe
  impairment.&nbsp; Pairing this data with the relatively low percentage (51.5%) of
  young adults aged 18 -25, with any mental disorder who received treatment---compared
  to adults aged 26-49, 66.1%, and older adults aged 50 and older, 71.5%---it is clear
  we need to understand mental health stigma and the cultural barriers adolescents
  from different cultures face when seeking mental health treatment.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml#part_155771\">https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml#part_155771</a></span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">According to the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the
  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the Department of Health and Human
  Services, in 2016 suicide was the second leading cause of death for youths aged
  15 to 24, with 5,723 deaths (17.6%).&nbsp; Suicide for Asian American/Pacific Islander
  (AAPI) youths in this age group had the largest percentage, 30.8%, with 316 deaths
  in 2016.&nbsp; This data, and other statistics, can be found at <a href=\"https://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/leadcause.html\">https://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/leadcause.html</a>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The challenge of raising
  mental health awareness among AAPI communities is multifaceted but includes two
  key barriers: language issues and cultural barriers.&nbsp; To address these barriers,
  the Healthy Mind Initiative <a href=\"https://nimhd.blogs.govdelivery.com/2018/07/16/healthy-mind-initiative-an-innovative-model-to-address-emerging-mental-health-needs-among-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-youth/\">https://nimhd.blogs.govdelivery.com/2018/07/16/healthy-mind-initiative-an-innovative-model-to-address-emerging-mental-health-needs-among-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-youth/</a>
  was established to create a collaboration across the federal, state, county, and
  community sectors with two intents. The first aim is to improve mental health literacy
  in AAPI communities. The second aim is to address the mental health stigma and cultural
  barriers to seeking mental health treatment faced by AAPI youth and communities.
  </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The <em>Speaking Up About Mental Health!&nbsp;
  This Is My Story</em> Challenge was initiated to address this second aim and then
  further expanded to include any youth from any culture that may view mental health
  negatively or not at all due to stigma, lack of awareness and education, and differences
  in cultural conceptualization of mental health.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Solutions
  submitted to this Challenge could include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Creative
  ideas to start a conversation</span></li>\r\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Innovative ideas
  to remove/reduce/lower barriers</span></li>\r\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Suggested changes
  in school policies</span></li>\r\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Other areas of concern to
  individuals and their community</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Background:</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">This Challenge builds from the Health Mind Initiative. The founding
  members of the Healthy Mind Initiative include the U.S. Public Health Service Asian
  Pacific American Officers Committee as lead, working with the Substance Abuse and
  Mental Health Services Administration, the Montgomery County, Maryland, Department
  of Health and Human Service&rsquo;s Asian American Health Initiative, and the National
  Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD).&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the Calvin J. Li
  Memorial Foundation (CJL) have joined some of the original partners in the Healthy
  Mind Initiative to promote the Challenge and are not limiting the Challenge to AAPI
  communities but are opening the Challenge to all high school youths nationwide.</span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">The NIMH is a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
  an agency of the United States Government, and is authorized and established to
  conduct and support biomedical and behavioral research, health services research,
  research training, and health information dissemination with respect to the cause,
  diagnosis, treatment, control and prevention of mental illness.</span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">The NIMHD is also a component of the NIH and is authorized and established
  to conduct and support research, training, dissemination of information, and other
  programs with respect to minority health conditions and other populations with health
  disparities.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The Calvin J. Li Memorial Foundation
  is a nonprofit charitable organization and was established and funded by the Li
  family on September 16, 2015, to honor their beloved son, to support the welfare
  of Asian American children growing up in first generation immigrant families.&nbsp;
  The Foundation&rsquo;s mission is to promote the welfare of Asian American children
  and help create supportive social and family environments that empower children
  to define their own identities and pursue their own dreams.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span
  lang=\"EN\">Additional Information</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The
  National Institute of Mental Health is a research funding agency, but we provide
  a list of resources for informational purposes.&nbsp; If you or someone you know
  has a mental illness, there are ways to get help. Use these Resources <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/find-help/index.shtml\">https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/find-help/index.shtml</a>
  to find help for you, a friend, or a family member.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If
  you are in crisis and need immediate support or intervention, call, or go the website
  of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255 or <a href=\"https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/\">https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/</a>
  ). Your confidential and toll-free call goes to the nearest crisis center in the
  Lifeline national network, where trained crisis workers are available to talk 24
  hours a day, 7 days a week. These centers provide crisis counseling and mental health
  referrals. If the situation is potentially life-threatening, call 911 or go to a
  hospital emergency room.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Should the essay divulge
  information that would require the NIMH, NIMHD, or CJL Foundation to make a report,
  we will comply with the child abuse reporting law, which may require reporting to
  law enforcement.&nbsp; Should the essay divulge information that reveals the potential
  for future harm to self or others, NIMH may contact the participant and/or law enforcement
  as appropriate.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you have questions, contact:&nbsp;</span><a
