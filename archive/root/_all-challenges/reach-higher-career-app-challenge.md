description: With a constantly evolving career landscape, students often need support
  in planning for careers and college. While the current career guidance and counseling
  infrastructure plays a critical role in assisting students, one in five high schools
  nationwide lacks a school counselor. In 2013, the national average student-to-school-counselor
  ratio for K-12 counselors was 482:1. As a result, students receive only minutes
  of in-person time with their counselor annually, as they prepare to make postsecondary
  education and career decisions.    This Challenge seeks apps that will help students
  learn about all career options, while increasing the capacity of career counselors
  to assist students in planning for their futures. The apps should include integrated
  tools to assess student skills and interests, and offer information on occupations,
  education options, credentials, and career-seeking skills.    Those interested in
  participating in the Challenge should submit their mobile app solutions by December
  6, 2015. Up to five entrants will be selected to advance as finalists. Finalists
  will be awarded $25,000 each and will have the opportunity to improve upon their
  submissions during the Virtual Accelerator Phase, which will include access to mentorship
  from IBM and Microsoft.Â  The Challenge winner(s) will win the remainder of the prize
  money and additional prizes, including IBM Global Entrepreneurship Program Credits,
  Microsoft BizSpark Plus, and free hosting services. <br>   <strong>For a complete list
