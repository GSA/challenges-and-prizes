ideaSubmitFormInstruction: You will first have to create an account on Kaggle.com    You
  can select up to 2 submissions to be used to calculate your final leaderboard score.
  If 2 submissions are not selected, they will be chosen based on your best submission
  scores on the public leaderboard.    Your final score will not be based on the same
  exact subset of data as the public leaderboard, but rather a different private data
  subset of your full submission —your public score is only a rough indication of
  what your final score is.    You should thus choose submissions that will most likely
  be best overall, and not necessarily on the public subset.    You may submit algorithms
  on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-fisheries-steller-sea-lion-population-count/submit">Submit

rules: "<ul>    <li>Pretrained models can be used in this competition, provided
  that they are posted in the official discussion thread before the competition
  entry deadline.</li>  </ul>  <h3>One account per participant</h3>  You cannot
  sign up to Kaggle from multiple accounts and therefore you cannot submit from
  multiple accounts.  <h3>No private sharing outside teams</h3>  Privately sharing
  code or data outside of teams is not permitted. It's okay to share code if made
  available to all participants on the forums.  <h3>Team Mergers</h3>  Team mergers
  are allowed and can be performed by the team leader. In order to merge, the
  combined team must have a total submission count less than or equal to the maximum
  allowed as of the merge date. The maximum allowed is the number of submissions
  per day multiplied by the number of days the competition has been running.  <h3>Team
  Limits</h3>  There is no maximum team size.  <h3>Submission Limits</h3>  You
  may submit a maximum of 5 entries per day.    You may select up to 2 final submissions
  for judging.  <h3>Competition Timeline</h3>  Start Date: <strong>TBA</strong>

  'Competition'): NOAA Fisheries Steller Sea Lion Population Count    COMPETITION
  SPONSOR: NOAA    COMPETITION WEBSITE: https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-fisheries-steller-sea-lion-population-count
  \   PRIZES: $25,000 total    WINNER LICENSE TYPE: Non-Exclusive License    MAXIMUM
  TEAM SIZE: as listed above    MAXIMUM SUBMISSIONS PER DAY: as listed above  <h3>COMPETITION
  FRAMEWORK</h3>  These are the complete, official rules for the Competition (the
  'Competition Rules') and incorporate by reference the contents of the Competition
  Website listed above.    By downloading a dataset linked from the Competition
  Website, submitting an entry to this Competition, or joining a Team in this
  Competition, you are agreeing to be bound by these Competition Rules which constitute
  a binding agreement between you and the Competition Sponsor.    The Competition
  is sponsored by the Competition Sponsor listed above and hosted on the Sponsor's
  behalf by Kaggle Inc ('Kaggle').    The Competition will run from Start Date
  to End Date as listed on the Competition Website. Note that Competition deadlines
  are subject to change and additional hurdle deadlines may be introduced during
  the Competition. Any additional or altered deadlines not already described in
  these Competition Rules will be publicized to the Participants via the Competition
  Website. It is the Participant's responsibility in this Competition to check
  the website regularly throughout the Competition to stay informed of any new
  or updated deadlines. Neither Kaggle nor Competition Sponsor are responsible
  for any Participant's failure to do so.    Each registered individual or Team
  is referred to as a Participant. You may only participate using a single, unique
  Kaggle account registered at http://www.kaggle.com. Participating using more
  than one Kaggle account per individual Participant is a breach of these Competition
  Rules and Competition Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any Participant
  (or Team including Participant) who is found to breach these Competition Rules.
  \ <h3>ELIGIBILITY</h3>  The Competition is open to all individuals over the
  age of 18 at the time of entry and to all validly formed legal entities that
  have not declared or been declared in bankruptcy.    Officers, directors, employees
  and advisory board members (and their immediate families and members of the
  same household) of the Competition Sponsor, Kaggle and their respective affiliates,
  subsidiaries, contractors (with the express exception of Kaggle's authorized
  Kaggle Community Evangelists), agents, judges and advertising and promotion
  agencies are not eligible to participate in the Competition.    You are not
  eligible to receive any Prize in the Competition if you are a resident of a
  country designated by the United States Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets
  Control (see &lt;http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx&gt;
  for additional information).  <h3>SUBMISSIONS</h3>  'Submission' means the material
  submitted by you in the manner and format specified on the Website via the Submission
  form on the Website. You (or if you are part of a Team, your Team) may submit
  up to the maximum number of Submissions per day as specified above. All Submissions
  must be uploaded to the Website in the manner and format specified on the Website.
  Submissions must be received prior to the Competition deadline and adhere to
  the guidelines for Submissions specified on the Website.    Submissions may
  not use or incorporate information from hand labeling or human prediction of
  the validation dataset or test data records.    If the Competition is a multi-stage
  Competition with temporally separate training data and/or leaderboard data,
  one or more valid Submissions must be made and selected during each stage of
  the Competition in the manner described on the Competition Website.  <h3>INTELLECTUAL
  PROPERTY</h3>  <h4>DATA</h4>  'Data' means the Data or Datasets linked from
  the Competition Website for the purpose of use by Participants in the Competition.
  For the avoidance of doubt, Data is deemed for the purpose of these Competition
  Rules to include any prototype or executable code provided to Participants by
  Kaggle or Competition Sponsor via the Website. Participants must use the Data
  only as permitted by these Competition Rules and any associated data use rules
  specified on the Competition Website.    Unless otherwise permitted by the terms
  of the Competition Website, Participants must use the Data solely for the purpose
  and duration of the Competition, including but not limited to reading and learning
  from the Data, analyzing the Data, modifying the Data and generally preparing
  your Submission and any underlying models and participating in forum discussions
  on the Website. Participants agree to use suitable measures to prevent persons
  who have not formally agreed to these Competition Rules from gaining access
  to the Data and agree not to transmit, duplicate, publish, redistribute or otherwise
  provide or make available the Data to any party not participating in the Competition.
  Participants agree to notify Kaggle immediately upon learning of any possible
  unauthorized transmission or unauthorized access of the Data and agree to work
  with Kaggle to rectify any unauthorized transmission. Participants agree that
  participation in the Competition shall not be construed as having or being granted
  a license (expressly, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise) under, or any
  right of ownership in, any of the Data.  <h4>EXTERNAL DATA</h4>  Unless otherwise
  expressly stated on the Competition Website, Participants must not use data
  other than the Data to develop and test their models and Submissions. Competition
  Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any Participant
  who Competition Sponsor discovers has undertaken or attempted to undertake the
  use of data other than the Data, or who uses the Data other than as permitted
  according to the Competition Website and in these Competition Rules, in the
  course of the Competition.  <h4>CODE SHARING</h4>  Participants are prohibited
  from privately sharing source or executable code developed in connection with
  or based upon the Data, and any such sharing is a breach of these Competition
  Rules and may result in disqualification.    Participants are permitted to publicly
  share source or executable code developed in connection with or based upon the
  Data, or otherwise relevant to the Competition, provided that such sharing does
  not violate the intellectual property rights of any third party. By so sharing,
  the sharing Participant is thereby deemed to have licensed the shared code under
  the MIT License (an open source software license commonly described at &lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT&gt;).
  \ <h4>OPEN-SOURCE CODE</h4>  A Submission will be ineligible to win a prize
  if it was developed using code containing or depending on software licensed
  under an open source license:    * <em>other than</em> an Open Source Initiative-approved
  license (see &lt;http://opensource.org/&gt;); or  * an open source license that
  prohibits commercial use.  <h3>WINNING</h3>  <h4>DETERMINING WINNERS</h4>  This
  Competition is a challenge of skill and the final results are determined solely
  by leaderboard ranking on the private leaderboard (subject to compliance with
  these Competition Rules). Participants' scores and ranks on the Competition
  Website at any given stage of the Competition will be based on the evaluation
  metric described on the Competition Website, as determined by applying the predictions
  in the Submission to the ground truth of a validation dataset whose instances
  were a fixed set sampled from the Data.    The evaluation metric used for scoring
  and ranking Submissions will be displayed on the Competition Website.    Prize
  awards are subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these
  Competition Rules. All decisions of the Competition Sponsor and judges will
  be final and binding on all matters relating to this Competition. Competition
  Sponsor reserves the right to examine the Submission and any associated code
  or documentation for compliance with these Competition Rules. In the event that
  the Submission demonstrates a breach of these Competition Rules, Competition
  Sponsor may at its discretion take either of the following actions:    * disqualify
  your Submission(s); or  * require that you remediate within one week all issues
  identified in your Submission(s) (including, without limitation, the resolution
  of license conflicts, the fulfillment of all obligations required by software
  licenses, and the removal of any software that violates the software restrictions).
  \ <h4>RESOLVING TIES</h4>  A tie between two or more valid and identically ranked
  submissions will be resolved in favour of the tied submission that was submitted
  first.  <h4>DECLINING PRIZES</h4>  A Participant may decline to be nominated
  as a Winner by notifying Kaggle directly within one week following the Competition
  deadline, in which case the declining Participant forgoes any prize or other
  features associated with winning the Competition. Kaggle reserves the right
  to disqualify a Participant who so declines at Kaggle's sole discretion if Kaggle
  deems disqualification appropriate.  <h3>WINNERS' OBLIGATIONS</h3>  <h4>DELIVERY
  &amp; DOCUMENTATION</h4>  As a condition of receipt of the Prize, the Prize
  winner must deliver the final model’s software code as used to generate the
  winning Submission and associated documentation (consistent with the winning
  model documentation template available on the kaggle wiki at https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/WinningModelDocumentationTemplate)
  to the Competition Sponsor. The delivered software code must be capable of generating
  the winning Submission and contain a description of resources required to build
  and/or run the executable code successfully.    If a potential winning Participant
  or Team member is a U.S. citizen, potential winner must also sign and return
  an IRS W-9 form, or if a foreign resident, an IRS W-8BEN form, within the stated
  time in order to claim the prize.    Potential winners will be disqualified
  and the prize may be awarded to an alternate winner (the next-ranked qualified
  Participant on the leaderboard) if    * the required documentation is not returned
  within 14 days after receipt of any request to provide documentation;  * prize
  notification letter/email or prize is returned as undeliverable; or  * potential
  winner or winning Team member is disqualified for any reason.    By accepting
  any Prize, each Participant receiving a Prize thereby agrees to use of his/her
  name, address, likeness and/or Prize information by Kaggle and Competition Sponsor
  for promotional purposes in any medium without additional compensation.  <h4>PARTICIPANT
  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSING</h4>  As a further condition of receipt of a
  Prize, each winning Participant thereby licenses their winning Submission and
  the source code used to generate the Submission according to the Winner License
  Type specified above (note: if no Winner License Type is specified above, the
  Winner License Type is deemed to be Non-Exclusive License).  <h5>PUBLIC COMPETITIONS:
  NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE</h5>  If the Winner License Type for the Competition (see
  Winner License Type above) is a Non-Exclusive License then each Winner by accepting
  a Prize thereby:    * grants to Competition Sponsor and its designees a worldwide,
  non-exclusive, sub-licensable, transferable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual,
  irrevocable right to use, not use, reproduce, distribute, create derivative
  works of, publicly perform, publicly display, digitally perform, make, have
  made, sell, offer for sale and import their winning Submission and the source
  code used to generate the Submission, in any media now known or hereafter developed,
  for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without further approval
  by or payment to Participant; and  * represents that he/she/it has the unrestricted
  right to grant that license.  <h5>RESEARCH COMPETITIONS: OPEN SOURCE LICENSE</h5>
  \ If the Winner License Type for the Competition (see Winner License Type above)
  is Open Source License, then each Winner by accepting a Prize thereby:    *
  licenses their winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission
  under the MIT License (an open source software license commonly described at
  &lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT&gt;), unless another open source license
  is chosen explicitly from the list of those approved by the Open Source Initiative at
  &lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/&gt;; and  * represents that he/she/it has
  the unrestricted right to grant that license.  <h5>RECRUITING COMPETITION SUBMISSION
  LICENSE GRANT</h5>  If the Competition is classed above as a Recruiting Competition,
  Participant agrees to grant and hereby grants to Competition Sponsor a perpetual,
  irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, and sublicenseable right
  to use, review, reproduce, and internally distribute the Submission (including
  any and all submitted source code) in connection with evaluating Participant's
  suitability for employment, provided that the Submission licensed as set forth
  above will not be used for Competition Host’s commercial purposes except as
  may otherwise be set forth in this Agreement.  <h4>CHEATING</h4>  Participating
  using more than one Kaggle account is deemed cheating and, if discovered, will
  result in disqualification from the Competition and any other affected Competitions
  and may result in banning or deactivation of affected Kaggle accounts.  <h4>RECEIVING
  PRIZES</h4>  After verification of eligibility, each Prize winner will receive
  the prize in the form of a check or wire transfer made out to the Prize winner
  (if an individual, or to the individual Team members if a Team). Allow 30 days
  from final confirmation for Prize delivery. Any winners who are U.S. citizens
  will receive an IRS 1099 form in the amount of their prize at the appropriate
  time. Prize winners are responsible for any taxes, fees or other liability resulting
  from their receipt of a Prize.  <h3>TEAMS</h3>  <h4>FORMING A TEAM</h4>  Multiple
  individuals or entities may collaborate as a team (“Team”). You may not participate
  on more than one Team. Each Team member must be a single individual operating
  a separate Kaggle account. You must register individually for the Competition
  before joining a Team. You must confirm your Team membership to make it official
  by responding to the Team notification message which will be sent to your Account.
  \   Team membership may not exceed the Maximum Team Size.  <h4>TEAM MERGERS</h4>
  \ Teams may be permitted to merge at Kaggle’s discretion, so long as the merged
  Team meets all requirements in these Competition Rules. Kaggle will review any
  merger request and will either approve or reject the request within three business
  days. Merger requests may be rejected if the combined number of Entries made
  by the merging Teams exceeds the number of Entries permissible at the date of
  the merger request. Team merger requests will not be permitted within seven
  days of any deadline listed on the Competition Website.  <h4>TEAM PRIZES</h4>
  \ If a Team wins a monetary Prize, Competition Sponsor will allocate the Prize
  money in even shares between the Team members unless the Team unanimously contacts
  Kaggle via the Competition Website within three business days following the
  Submission deadline to request an alternative prize distribution.  <h3>WARRANTIES
  AND OBLIGATIONS</h3>  <h4>PARTICIPANT WARRANTIES AND OBLIGATIONS</h4>  By registering,
  you agree that (a) your Account is complete, correct and accurate and (b) your
  registration may be rejected or terminated and all Entries submitted by you

description: 'Steller sea lions in the western Aleutian Islands have declined 94 percent
  in the last 30 years. The endangered western population, found in the North Pacific,
  are the focus of conservation efforts which require annual population counts. Specially
  trained scientists at <a href="https://www.afsc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow
  noopener noreferrer">NOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science Center</a> conduct
  these surveys using airplanes and unoccupied aircraft systems to collect aerial
  images. Having accurate population estimates enables us to better understand factors
  that may be contributing to lack of recovery of Stellers in this area.<img class="alignright"

  alt="NOAA Stellar Sea Lions" width="221" height="221" />    Currently, it takes
  biologists up to four months to count sea lions from the thousands of images NOAA
  Fisheries collects each year. Once individual counts are conducted, the tallies
  must be reconciled to confirm their reliability. The results of these counts are
  time-sensitive.    In this competition, Kagglers are invited to develop algorithms
  which accurately count the number of sea lions in aerial photographs. Automating
  the annual population count will free up critical resources allowing NOAA Fisheries
  to focus on ensuring we hear the sea lion’s roar for many years to come. Plus, advancements
  in computer vision applied to aerial population counts may also greatly benefit
  other endangered species.    <hr />    Learn more about research being done to better
  understand what''s going on with the endangered Steller sea lion populations by
  joining scientists on a research vessel to the western Aleutian Islands in the video
