description: 'DREAMS is an ambitious partnership to reduce new HIV infections among
  adolescent girls and young women in 10 sub-Saharan African countries. The goal of
  DREAMS is help girls develop into <strong>Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-Free,
  Mentored,</strong> and <strong>Safe</strong> women. DREAMS is delivering a Core
  Package of evidence-informed approaches that go beyond the health sector, addressing
  the structural drivers that directly or indirectly increase girls HIV risk, including
  poverty, gender inequality, sexual violence, and lack of education.    The DREAMS
  Partnership has committed $85 million for the DREAMS Innovation Challenge to support
  solutions to address unmet needs not covered by the DREAMS Core Package.    The
  DREAMS Innovation Challenge seeks to award and implement innovative solutions in
  six focus areas that further DREAMS’ commitment to reduce HIV infections by infusing
  new thinking and high-impact approaches to meet the urgent, complex needs of adolescent
  girls and young women in the 10 DREAMS countries – Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique,
  South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The six Challenge
  Focus areas are:  <ul>   <li><strong>Focus 1: </strong>Strengthening capacity of
  communities for service delivery</li>   <li><strong>Focus 2: </strong>Keeping girls
  in secondary school</li>   <li><strong>Focus 3: </strong>Linking men to services</li>   <li><strong>Focus
  4: </strong>Supporting pre-exposure prophylaxis</li>   <li><strong>Focus 5: </strong>Providing
  a bridge to employment</li>   <li><strong>Focus 6: </strong>Applying data to increase
  impact</li>  </ul>'
