  interactive solution in the form of an application, application programming
  interface (API), and/or data mashup that utilizes federal data collected.  The
  technology solution should be innovative!  GSA does not want an analysis tool
  that tells what is already known, rather they should be forward-thinking solutions
  that enhance transparency.  </span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution
  should accomplish two tasks:</span>  <ol>   <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">
     </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visually display or transmit data
  in a way that will enhance the way federal government works; and  </span></li>   <li><span
  style="font-weight: 400;">    I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dentify
  relationships through the analysis of the data, if they exist, while providing
  valuable insights that could be gained through improved data collection efforts.</span></li>  </ol>  <b>3.
  DATA:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants will be provided all
  final project ideas, existing code, and publicly available datasets in advance
  of the event.  Event information will be posted on the following page,</span>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span><a href="http://open.gsa.gov/EarthDayHackathon/"><span

  PRIZES:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">GSA may award prizes of no more
  than $1,000 to each member of a winning team (3 team’s total).  GSA is not required
  to award all prizes if the judges determine that a smaller number of entries
  meet the scope and requirements laid out for this competition, or if the agency
  only plans to use code from a smaller number of entries.  </span>    <span style="font-weight:
  400;">Funding for this Government-wide Earth Day Hackathon will come from GSA.
   Prizes will be awarded to each member of a winning team via Electronic Funds
  Transfer (EFT), within 60 days of announcing the winner(s).  </span>    <b>5.
  ELIGIBILITY</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> :  </span><span style="font-weight:
  400;">Eligibility to participate in the Government-wide Earth Day Hackathon
  and win a prize is limited to entities/individuals:</span>  <ul>   <li>That
  have registered to participate in the competition and complied with the rules
  of the competition as explained in this posting; and</li>   <li style="font-weight:
  400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That have been incorporated in and maintain
  a primary place of business in the United States, and in the case of an individual,
  whether participating singly or in a group, the participant must be a citizen
  or permanent resident of the United States.</span></li>  </ul>  <span style="font-weight:
  400;">Participants may not be a federal entity or federal employee acting within
  the scope of employment.  However, an individual or entity shall not be deemed
  ineligible to win prize money because the individual or entity used federal
  facilities or consulted with federal employees during a competition if the facilities
  and employees are made available to all individuals and entities participating
  in the competition on an equitable basis.</span>    <span style="font-weight:
  400;">Participants agree to assume any and all risks and waive claims against
  the federal government and its related entities, except in the case of willful
  misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue, or

  in this competition, whether the injury, death, damage, or loss arose through
  negligence or otherwise.  Entrants are not required to obtain liability insurance
  or demonstrate financial responsibility in order to participate in this Hackathon.      </span>    As
  the Federal Government is under a strict duty not to give preferential treatment
  to any private organization or individual, participants must agree to take diligent
  care to avoid the appearance of Federal Government endorsement of competition
  participation and submission.  Participants must agree not to refer to to the
  Federal Government''s use of your submission (be it product or service) in any
  commercial advertising or similar promotions in a manner that could reasonably
  imply (in the judgment of a reasonable person) that the GSA or the Federal Government
  endorses, prefers, sponsors, or has an affiliation with participants’ products
  or services.  Participants agree that GSA’s trademarks, logos, service marks,
  trade names, or the fact that GSA awarded a prize to a participant, shall not
  be used by the participant to imply direct GSA endorsement of participant or
  participant’s submission.  Both participants and GSA may list the other party’s
  name in a publicly available customer or other list so long as the name is not
  displayed in a more prominent fashion than any other third-party name.    <b>6.

description: '<strong>GENERAL INFORMATION</strong>    The General Services Administration
  (GSA) is committed to being green, because we believe a green planet is a happy
  planet.  At GSA, we know that sustainability helps federal agencies meet their missions
  today, without sacrificing their ability to serve future generations.  But we can''t
  do it without you!  That''s why we''re inviting you to participate in the Government-wide
  Earth Day Hackathon, hosted by GSA''s <span style="font-weight: 400;">Office of
  Citizen Services, and, Innovative Technologies and 18F (OCSIT/18F)</span>.  We hope
  to see you on Earth Day, April 22, 2016, as we work together to keep our planet
  green and clean.    The goal of this competition is to have industry, academia and
  government develop smart technology solutions in the form of an application, application
  programming interface (API), web/mobile application, data mashup, and dashboards
  that have the capability to provide GSA with key insights and recommendations for
  future enhancements.    All coders, developers, designers, engineers, data scientists,
  and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from industry, academia, and federal government
  are invited to participate.  Participants will be competing on self-selected teams
  to develop smart technology solutions.    GSA’s OCSIT/18F Organization will be partnering
  with the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), the United States Environmental
  Protection Agency (EPA), the General Services Administration (GSA), the National
  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
  Administration (NOAA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the
  United States Forest Service (USFS).    <strong>PROJECTS - </strong>Listed below

  by agencies using data captured in the government-wide procurement system.  Show
  which agencies are putting their dollars towards environmentally sustainable products
  and services.</li>   <li><strong><strong>Assessment of Wildfire Hazard Location
  for Federal and Public Users: </strong></strong>Create a website or app that allows
  federal agencies or the public to assess whether or not their property is located
  in an area of wildfire risk as defined by the Wildland Urban Interface guidelines.</li>  </ul>  <p
  style="text-align: center;"><strong>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</strong></p>    <ul>   <li><strong>Develop
  a Method to Identify Fraudulent Reporting to the EPA:</strong> Using Benford’s law
  of statistical probability, build a tool to scan environmental data from industries
  or other regulated entities to identify potential cases of fraudulent reporting.</li>   <li><strong>Tailored
  UV Index Forecast for Beaches: </strong>The UV Index, a numeric index of the strength
  of cancer-causing UV rays from the sun, is a forecast produced by the National Weather
  Service.  The forecast data are run through the EPA’s Envirofacts and put out to
  the public through our app and widget.  The app has been featured on nationwide
  media and TV.  Develop code that can be deployed on Android and iOS mobile apps
  that displays UV Index forecast information specific to a defined beach.</li>   <li><strong>Climate
