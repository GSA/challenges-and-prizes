rules: '<h3><strong><u>Eligibility</u></strong><strong>:</strong></h3>  To compete
  in the Campus RainWorks Challenge, student teams must be affiliated with a degree-granting
  public or private institution of higher education located in the U.S. and be
  sponsored by a faculty advisor. All team members must be enrolled in an undergraduate
  or graduate degree program at an eligible college or university as of August
  31, 2017.  <h3><strong><u>Submission Categories</u>:</strong></h3>  To encourage
  participating teams to assess the environmental, economic, and social benefits
  of green infrastructure at a range of spatial scales, EPA is accepting submissions
  in two design categories:  <h4><strong>Demonstration Project Category</strong></h4>  For
  submissions in the Demonstration Project category, EPA is seeking proof-of-concept
  level designs that examine how green infrastructure could be integrated into
  a particular site on the team’s campus to meet multiple environmental, educational,
  and economic objectives. Entries in this category should include detailed information
  on the design and performance of the proposed demonstration project, and should
  reflect extensive consultation with the facilities planning department to assess
  project feasibility.  <h4><strong>Master Plan Category</strong></h4>  For submissions
  in the Master Plan category, EPA is seeking conceptual designs that examine
  how green infrastructure could be integrated into a broad area of the team’s
  campus. Entries in this category should be coordinated with existing campus
  master plans and should describe how green infrastructure could be used to enhance
  the long-term sustainability of the campus.  <h4><strong>Submission Requirements  </strong></h4>  To
  compete in EPA’s Campus RainWorks Challenge, registered teams must submit the
  following which describe an innovative green infrastructure project for a location
  on their campus:  <ul>    <li>One (1) Project Narrative</li>    <li>One (1)
  Design Board</li>    <li>One (1) Video Pitch</li>    <li>One (1) Letter of Support</li>  </ul>  Submissions
  should provide detailed information of sufficient quality to enable the judges
  to evaluate the design. Submissions should describe overall project goals, how
  the project fits within the context of the campus or watershed, existing conditions
  along with the problem to be solved, proposed green infrastructure approaches,
  and expected outcomes.  <h4><strong>Project Narrative</strong></h4>  The intent
  of the project narrative is to provide a summary of each team''s approach to
  meeting the challenge criteria.  <ul>    <li>Each team must prepare a project
  narrative not to exceed twelve (12) 8.5” x 11” pages (including images, graphics,
  and tables; excluding cover page, abstract, and an additional allowance of two
  pages for calculations and references only). Note that additional pages will
  not be reviewed. Pages should be consecutively numbered with 1” margins, and
  text should be single-spaced in standard 12-point font. Headings may be larger
  than 12-point font; text labels for graphics or images may be smaller than 12-point
  font; page numbers may be outside of the 1” margin.</li>    <li>The project
  narrative must include a cover page. The cover page must display the team’s
  registration number, project title, names and academic majors of team members,
  and the name and academic department of the team’s faculty advisor. The cover
  page must also include a project abstract of no more than 250 words.</li>    <li>Teams
  must provide an electronic copy of the project narrative in Adobe Acrobat® PDF
  format. Instructions on submitting deliverables are provided below.<strong>  </strong></li>  </ul>  <h4><strong>Design
  Board</strong></h4>  <ul>    <li>The intent of the design board is to provide
  a visual understanding of the site context, design elements, and design performance.</li>    <li>The
  design board must focus on visual elements and limit the amount of text. The
  design board should supplement, not duplicate, graphics within the project narrative.</li>    <li>Each
  team must prepare one 24” x 36” design board. The design board must include
  the team’s registration number (see Registration section) in the upper right
  hand corner.</li>    <li>The design board must include a site plan. Additional
  elements might include cross sections, conceptual drawings, or graphics representing
  anticipated benefits.</li>    <li>Teams must provide an electronic copy of the
  design board in Adobe Acrobat® PDF format. Submission instructions are provided
  below.</li>  </ul>  <h4><strong>Video Pitch</strong></h4>  <ul>    <li>Each
  team must prepare a video pitch about the project not to exceed 3 minutes. Videos
  longer than 3 minutes will not be viewed.</li>    <li>The video pitch should
  be persuasive in illustrating the potential environmental, economic, and social
  benefits of the project.</li>    <li>The video pitch could include, but is not
  limited to: a tour of the potential site; discussion of design components; interviews
  with team members, faculty or industry practitioners; or financing options.

  enthusiasm are encouraged and appreciated.</li>    <li>Teams must upload their
  video pitch to YouTube or a similar video-sharing website and provide a link
  with their submission (see submission instructions). Videos should be set as
  “unlisted” or “private” so that entries cannot be detected by search engines
  prior to the submission deadline. Once the submission deadline has passed, teams
  should set their videos to “public”.  See below for instructions on uploading
  project videos to YouTube and setting videos as “Unlisted” on YouTube:</li>    <li><a
  href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop">How
  to upload a video on YouTube</a></li>    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?hl=en">How
  to change a video''s privacy settings on YouTube</a></li>  </ul>  <h4><strong>Letter
  of Support</strong></h4>  <ul>    <li>The intent of the letter of support is
  to demonstrate consultation with the college or university’s facilities planning
  department to develop a feasible design. Each team must submit a letter from
  a member of the college or university’s facilities planning department demonstrating
  support for the proposed design.</li>    <li>The letter does not count against
  the 12 page limit of the Project Narrative. Letters of support are not to exceed
  two 8.5” by 11” pages. Note that pages in excess of two will not be reviewed.</li>    <li>The
  letter must be on appropriate letterhead. Additionally, the letter must be signed
  by a member of the facilities planning department, and include the registration
  number and project title.</li>    <li>The letter must be provided in Adobe Acrobat
  PDF format. Instructions on submitting project files are provided below.</li>  </ul>'

description: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Water is pleased
  to announce the 6th annual Campus RainWorks Challenge, a design competition that
  is open to colleges and universities in the United States and its territories. Through
  the Campus RainWorks Challenge, EPA seeks to engage with undergraduate and graduate
  students to foster a dialogue about responsible stormwater management and showcase
  the environmental, economic and social benefits of green infrastructure practices.    Stormwater
  runoff is a major source of water pollution in urban communities across the United
  States. Traditionally, stormwater is drained through engineered collection systems,
  or “gray infrastructure,” and discharged into nearby waterbodies. Stormwater doesn’t
  like to travel alone:  as it moves through the landscape it captures and carries
  trash, bacteria, heavy metals and other pollutants from the urban environment. These
  contaminants degrade water quality and threaten public health. High stormwater flows
  also cause erosion and flooding, damaging habitat, property, and infrastructure.
  Green infrastructure offers flexible solutions for managing stormwater runoff.    The
  term “green infrastructure” refers to a variety of practices that restore or mimic
  natural hydrological processes. While “gray” stormwater infrastructure is largely
  designed to convey stormwater away from the built environment, green infrastructure
  uses soils, vegetation and other media to manage rainwater where it falls through
  capture and evapotranspiration. By integrating natural processes into the built
  environment, green infrastructure provides a wide variety of community benefits,
  including improving water and air quality, reducing urban heat island effects, creating
  habitat for pollinators and other wildlife, and providing aesthetic and recreational
  value. Green infrastructure solutions can also be cheaper to install and maintain
  than traditional gray infrastructure.    Water pollution associated with stormwater
  runoff is a problem that is growing in scope and magnitude. Communities need planners,
  designers, engineers, and other professionals to create dynamic, resilient, and
  affordable solutions for stormwater management. Today's scholars are tomorrow's
  design professionals. The Campus RainWorks Challenge will recruit their creativity
  and expertise to jointly advance EPA's mission of protecting public health and water
  quality.
