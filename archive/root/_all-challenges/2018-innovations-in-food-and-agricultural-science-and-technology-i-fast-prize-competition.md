rules: "<strong>Eligibility Rules for Participating in the Competition: </strong>
  \   <strong><em>The I-FAST Competition is open to teams (“Teams” or “Participants”)
  that are made up of individuals from academic/university institutions that have
  received a prior NIFA award in a scientific or engineering field relevant to
  the proposed innovation that is currently active or that has been active within
  five years from the closing date of the Pre-Application Open Period.</em></strong>
  The prior award could range from a modest single-investigator award to a large,
  distributed center and also includes awards involving students.    To be eligible
  to win a prize under the Competition, Teams:  <ul>    <li>Shall have registered
  to participate in the Competition under the rules;</li>    <li>Shall have complied
  with all the requirements of the Competition rules;</li>    <li>May not include
  a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment;
  and</li>    <li>In the case of a private entity Team member, the member shall
  be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States.
  In the case of an individual Team member, shall be a citizen or permanent resident
  of the United States.</li>  </ul>  Makeup of I-FAST Competition Teams: Each
  Team shall consist of three members:  <ul>    <li>Entrepreneurial Lead (EL)</li>
  \   <li>I-FAST Team Mentor</li>    <li>Principal Investigator (PI)</li>  </ul>
  \ I-FAST teams are made up of individuals from an academic/university institution
  except for the Mentor who may reside with a non-academic institution as described
  below. Also described below, are the responsibilities of each team member should
  the Team be selected as a winner of the competition.    The Entrepreneurial
  Lead (EL) could be a postdoctoral scholar, graduate, or other student with relevant
  knowledge of the technology located at the academic/university institution and
  a deep commitment to investigate the commercial landscape surrounding the innovation.
  The EL should also be capable and have the will to support the transition of
  the technology to commercial viability. The EL will be responsible for: 1) developing
  the team to include the mentor and PI, 2) leading the development of the pre-application,
  participating in the I-FAST interviews and developing the full application,
  if selected, 3) starting and completing all training activities in the Entrepreneurial
  Immersion course provided by the NSF I-Corps program, 4) communicating and coordinating
  with team members to achieve the goals of the team, 5) developing and monitoring
  team activity milestones from the Entrepreneurial Immersion course, 6) ensuring
  the team milestones are completed on time, and 7) ensuring the team is in communication
  with the NIFA I-FAST Competition Director and the NSF I-Corps Program Director
  as needed.    Ideally, the I-FAST Teams Mentor will be an experienced or emerging
  entrepreneur with proximity to the academic/university institution and have
  prior experience developing and commercializing other products within the broader
  technology space related to the specific project under development. The Mentor
  should be selected as a third-party resource, or may be a person that has an
  established relationship with the team (e.g., Board Member, consultant), but
  cannot be an employee nor directly involved with the technology development.
  The EL will need to identify a Mentor that has business expertise in the proposed
  technology sector and has entrepreneurial experience. A Mentor will be someone
  with appropriate contacts in the technology area of commercialization which
  are critical for propelling the technology towards commercialization. The EL
  of the team should seek input from their University Technology Transfer Office
  for potential Mentors. The I-FAST Team’s Mentor will be responsible for guiding
  the team forward using existing entrepreneurial experience and tracking the
  team’s progress through regular communication with the EL, PI, the NIFA I-FAST
  competition director, and the NSF I-Corps Program Director, as needed.    The
  PI is expected to have in-depth knowledge of the innovation developed under
  the prior NIFA Grant and, if selected, will be responsible for: 1) coordinating
  with the university on the transfer of prize funds from NIFA, 2) tracking of
  the prize funding for team activities, 3) reporting to NIFA on disbursements
  and obligations of the prize funding, 4) guiding the EL and Mentor on technical
  aspects of the innovation, 5) communicating as needed with the NIFA I-FAST Competition
  Director and the NSF I-Corps Program Director, 6) ensuring the EL meets the
  required milestones for the NSF I-CORP training, and 7) participating as a team
  member. The Principal Investigator who received the earlier NIFA grant for the
  technology is allowed to participate on the team, but cannot be the Entrepreneurial
  Lead.    During the I-Corps course, each participating team, including all its
  team members, must:  <ul>    <li>Attend, in person, an evening reception and
  3-day kick-off Entrepreneurial Immersion course;</li>    <li>Conduct approximately
  100 customer interviews over the 6-week program, and submit interview summary
  reports. This process of customer discovery includes in-person face to face
  meetings with potential customers and requires the team to be “outside the building”
  for these activities. It is expected that the team will not use telephone or
  online conferencing during the customer discovery process. It is expected the
  team will require a minimum of 15 hours and a maximum of 40 hours per week</li>
  \   <li>Participate in 5 weekly webinar sessions and submit regular updates
  to the team’s business model canvas. In addition, it is expected that I-Corps
  teams will take advantage of instructor office hours; and</li>    <li>Attend,
  in person, the final 2-day course close out/lessons learned session (to be held
  in the same region as the kick-off course).</li>  </ul>  If one or more team
  members cannot meet these requirements, the team should not submit an application.

judging-criteria-description-0: 'Judging:  The information on the Competition
  will be provided via www.challenge.gov.   NIFA will screen all entries for eligibility
  and completeness. Entries from Teams that do not meet the eligibility requirements
  and/or that fail to include required submission elements will not be evaluated
  or considered for award. Eligible and complete entries will be judged by a fair
  and impartial panel of individuals from NIFA and NSF (the “Judging Panel”).  Pre-Application
  Evaluation: The Judging Panel will evaluate the pre-application to determine
  the following:  1) Did the technology proposed receive past NIFA funding within
  the specified timeframe?  2) Does the team have the required team members and
  are the roles of each team member clearly described and meet the noted responsibilities?  3)
  Does the commercialization plan provide a good understanding of the team’s knowledge
  of the current state of the art and how the technology could enter into a potential
  market?  4) Were the page limits met?   Following the evaluation, the Judging
  Panel will conduct a phone interview with each selected team. This will emphasize
  the time commitment and availability of the entire team to complete the NSF
  I-CORPS program during one of the fall 2018 cohorts.  Full-Application Evaluation:
  The Judging Panel will evaluate the Full-application to determine the following
  and approximately equal consideration will be given to each criterion except
  for item (3), which will receive twice the value of any of the other items:  1.
  I-Corps Team: Does the application clearly describe: the I-Corps team, the rationale
  for the team’s formation, members'' entrepreneurial expertise, relevance to
  the innovation effort, and members'' experience in collaborating?  2. Lineage
  of the Proposed Innovation: Does the application provide a table of previous
  NIFA awards and identify the original Principle Investigator (PI)? Does the
  application clearly describe how this research has led the Team to believe that
  a commercial opportunity exists for the effort moving forward?  3. Description
  of the Potential Commercial Impact: Does the application clearly describe the
  profile of a typical customer of the proposed innovation? Does the application
  describe the customer needs to be met by the proposed innovation? Does the application
  describe how the customer currently meets those needs with the current state
  of the art and does the customer believe this innovation is better than the
  current technology? Does the application clearly describe the proposed innovation
  and how it relates to the fundamental research already conducted under previous
  award(s)? Does the application describe how much a customer would pay for the
  solution?  4. Project plan: Does the project plan clearly describe the current
  status including the stage of development? Does the application provide a description
  of the proof-of-concept or technology demonstration that will be provided at
  the end of the project?  5. Page Limits: Did the application meet the required
  page limits?'

description: "<strong>SUMMARY:</strong> The National Institute of Food and Agriculture
  (NIFA), USDA, is announcing the I-FAST prize competition (the “I-FAST Competition”
  or the “Competition”) to develop and implement the Innovations in Food and Agricultural
  Science and Technology (I-FAST) Program. NIFA will partner with the National Science
  Foundation (NSF) Innovation Corps (I-Corps) to provide entrepreneurship training
  to NIFA grantees under this I-FAST pilot program. The goals are to identify valuable
  product opportunities that can emerge from NIFA supported academic research. Selected
  NIFA I-FAST project teams will participate in the educational programs with NSF
  I-Corps Program. Over a period of six months the NIFA supported teams in the I-FAST
  program will learn what it will take to achieve an economic impact with their particular
  innovation. The final goal of the I-FAST Competition is to facilitate technology
  transfer of innovations that can make an impact in the marketplace and the global
  economy.    <strong>Subject of Challenge Competition:</strong>    The National Institute
  of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), USDA, mission is to invest in and advance agricultural
  research, education, and extension to solve societal challenges. As part of this
  mission NIFA is charged with providing grant funding for research, education, and
  extension that address key problems of national, regional, and multi-state importance
  in sustaining all components of agriculture. A majority of NIFA grant funding is
  provided to academic institutions to focus on developing research in the areas of
  farm efficiency and profitability, ranching, renewable energy, forestry (both urban
  and agroforestry), aquaculture, rural communities and entrepreneurship, human nutrition,
  food safety, biotechnology, and conventional breeding.    NIFA will partner with
  the NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) who will provide an Entrepreneurial Immersion
  course and training to NIFA grantees through this I-FAST Competition. The goals
  of this Competition are to spur translation of fundamental research to the market
  place, to encourage collaboration between academia and industry, and to train NIFA-funded
  faculty, students and other researchers to understand innovation and entrepreneurship.
  \   The purpose of the I-FAST Competition is to identify NIFA-funded research teams
  (an I-FAST team includes the Principal Investigator (PI), the Entrepreneurial Lead,
  and the Mentor) who will receive additional support, in the form of mentoring, training,
  and funding to accelerate the translation of knowledge derived from fundamental
  research into emerging products and services that can attract subsequent third-party
  funding. NIFA-funded research teams will be required to participate in Entrepreneurial
  Immersion courses provided by the NSF I-Corps program. The NSF I-Corps is a program
  specifically designed to broaden the impact of select, basic research projects by
  preparing scientists and engineers to focus beyond the laboratory. Leveraging experience
  and guidance from established entrepreneurs and a targeted curriculum within the
  NSF I-Corp program, NIFA I-FAST teams will learn to identify valuable product opportunities
  that can emerge from NIFA supported academic research. The I-FAST Competition will
  help create a stronger national ecosystem for innovation that couples scientific
  discovery with technology development to address agricultural and societal needs.
