description: '<b>Boldline Religious Freedom (RF) </b>is the U.S. Department of State’s
  partnership accelerator aimed to support and scale innovative public-private partnerships
  (P3s) to promote and defend religious freedom around the world.  Boldline RF will
  support stakeholders who are leading social good P3s that align with U.S. foreign
  policy priorities and focus on giving them tools to scale their missions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
  </span>The main goal of Boldline RF is to build and deploy strategic collaborations
  aimed at advancing religious freedom globally by: a) facilitating connectivity between
  the private sector and governments; b) fostering innovative partnership models;
  and c) providing mentoring and training. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>    Through
  this accelerator program, Boldline RF will take the often dotted lines between government,
  private sector and civil society and create a bold line between the sectors through
  partnerships.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Department defines
  a partnership as a collaborative working relationship that includes non-governmental
  partners in which the goals, structure, and governance, as well as roles and responsibilities,
  are mutually determined and decision-making is shared.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
  </span>Successful partnerships entail shared objectives, transparency, mutual risks
  and benefits, and accountability.  <h4><b>The Accelerator</b></h4>  The U.S. Department
  of State, in close collaboration with industry leaders, will organize a three-day
  partnership building accelerator program that will bring together selected stakeholders
  of public-private partnerships, including civil society organizations, public institutions,
  corporations, innovation companies, entrepreneurship support organizations, and
  financial institutions to galvanize interest for the participating partnerships
  and to help build the framework for these partnerships in their respective countries. 
  We are seeking the participation of stakeholders representing partnerships that
  are in the early development stages or are ready to scale their activities and/or
  engage additional partners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Through
  a three-day accelerator and ongoing support, Boldline will provide the individuals
  and institutions behind these partnerships with mentorship, skills building, government
  relations, and global networks needed to scale their impact. The accelerator will
  take place in October 2018 in Washington, D.C., and participation in the program
  will be highly competitive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Funding
  for participation and travel will not be paid for by the U.S. Department of State.  <h4><b>Who
  We Are</b></h4>  The U.S. Department of State’s Office of Global Partnerships and
  Office of International Religious Freedom are working in collaboration to provide
  the Boldline RF accelerator program.    The U.S. Department of State’s Office of
  Global Partnerships is a center of excellence for collaboration between the U.S.
  Department of State, the public and private sectors, and civil society.  The Office
  aims to strengthen and deepen U.S. diplomacy and development around the world through
  partnerships that leverage the creativity, innovation, and core business resources
  of partners for greater impact.  The Department recognizes that it takes more than
  governments to address many global issues and believes that partnerships with the
  private sector, civil society, philanthropy and other non-governmental organizations
  are necessary for our national security and diplomacy objectives.    The U.S. Department
  of State’s Office of International Religious Freedom leads the U.S. government’s
  efforts to promote and defend freedom of religion, conscience, and belief for all
  people around the world. The Office monitors abuse and discrimination by governments
  and societal actors and develops and implements policies and programs to address
  these challenges.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Created by the International
  Religious Freedom Act of 1998, the Office is led by Ambassador at Large for International
  Religious Freedom Sam Brownback who serves as a principal advisor to the President
  and the principal advisor to the Secretary of State on matters impacting religious
  freedom abroad.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>'
