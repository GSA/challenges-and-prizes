  *"Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning
  are paving the way to automate business processes ... Let us ride the digital
  wave of transformation together." -- Keith Nakasone, Deputy Assistant
  Commissioner for Acquisition, General Services Administration (GSA)*


  *"AI & ML leveraged successfully are force multipliers; transitioning historically resource intensive activities into high-speed-low-drag transactions.  Huge thank you in advance for your participation and contributions!" -- Sean C. Zerges, Director, Office of the Chief Technology Officer, GSA*


  The goal of this challenge is to develop an artificial intelligence (AI), or machine learning (ML) solution that will review end-user license agreements (EULA) for terms and conditions that are unacceptable to the government. On average it takes all parties involved approximately 7-14 days to review an EULA and ensure that all unacceptable terms and conditions are identified.


  A EULA details the rights and restrictions which apply to the use of software or services. It can also be known as a software license agreement or acceptable use policy. As part of the acquisition process of software or services, GSA reviews the associated EULAs. This review must be completed prior to awarding new contracts or modifying existing contracts. A GSA contracting officer (CO) reviews applicable EULAs for terms and conditions that are not in accordance with Federal law and regulations. The CO may also coordinate a legal review with the Office of General Counsel if they feel it is warranted. Should EULAs contain language that would conflict with Federal law and regulations, the CO must negotiate changes to the EULA to remove the problematic language.    


  We are looking for a solution that will use AI and/or ML to improve this manual process. The solution will include a user interface that GSA will use to process the documents and identify unacceptable clauses/terms in the EULAs. **[Watch our AI / ML challenge video](https://youtu.be/uOBFIqoOJ8k) to learn more about the desired solution.**


  This solution will decrease the time spent manually reviewing EULAs and free resources to focus on other aspects of the acquisition process.  It will also improve the accuracy and consistency of the review process.

  #### Ownership


  Any applicable ownership of IP in the submission will remain with the solver. By participating in the challenge the solver is not transferring any exclusive IP rights in applicable patents, pending patent applications, or copyrights in connection with the submission. However, by entering the submission, the solver agrees to grant the federal government certain license rights, as set forth in this section.


  Namely, the solver grants the government the right to review the submission, to publicly describe the submission in any materials created in connection with this challenge, to screen and evaluate the submission, and to have the judges, the Challenge administrators, and the designees of any of them review the submission. The government is also granted the right to publicize Solver names and, as applicable, the names of solver team members and/or organizations that participated in the submission following the conclusion of the challenge.


  In addition, a solver that receives a cash prize from this challenge agrees to grant the government the following license rights in the submission: 


  1. a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, paid-up, royalty-free license to practice or have practiced for or on the government’s behalf, throughout the world, any invention created by the Solver that covers the Submission; and 

  2. a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, paid-up, royalty-free license to reproduce, distribute publicly, prepare derivative works, and publicly perform and display the submission by or on behalf of the government, worldwide in any format, whether electronically or in print.


  By participating in the challenge, each solver (individual, team, or legal entity) represents and warrants that he or she is the sole author or owner of IP in connection with the submission, or otherwise has the necessary rights to use the submission for purposes of the challenge, including having any and all rights necessary to grant the license rights identified in this section. Each solver further represents and warrants that the Submission does not infringe any copyright or any other rights of any third party of which the solver is aware. To participate in the challenge, each solver warrants that there are no legal obstacles to granting the license rights of this section to the government.


  Use of open source, unless otherwise stated in the challenge rules above, if open source code is used in the model to generate a solution, then you must only use open source code licensed under an open source initiative-approved license (see [www.opensource.org](http://www.opensource.org)) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.

By participating in the challenge, each solver (individual, team, or legal entity) represents and warrants that he or she is the sole author or owner of IP in connection with the submission, or otherwise has the necessary rights to use the submission for purposes of the challenge, including having any and all rights necessary to grant the license rights identified in this section. Each solver further represents and warrants that the Submission does not infringe any copyright or any other rights of any third party of which the solver is aware. To participate in the challenge, each solver warrants that there are no legal obstacles to granting the license rights of this section to the government.

Use of open source, unless otherwise stated in the challenge rules above, if open source code is used in the model to generate a solution, then you must only use open source code licensed under an open source initiative-approved license (see [www.opensource.org](http://www.opensource.org)) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.

The winners of a cash prize for the Challenge (collectively, "Winners") may be featured on Federal websites, in newsletters, social media, and in other print and electronic outreach materials.

Except where prohibited, participation in the challenge constitutes the consent of each winner to the government’s and its agents’ use of each winner’s name, likeness, photograph, voice, opinions, public summary, and/or hometown and state information for promotional purposes through any form of media, worldwide, without further permission, payment, or consideration.

Finally, the government will continue to communicate the resulting winner’s solution only if it continues to deliver mutual benefit to the government in achieving its mission to provide relevant services.  In order to measure this and continue to improve programs and services, the Solver or Solver team must share platform use data with the government.

### Judging
