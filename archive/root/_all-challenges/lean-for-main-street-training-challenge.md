  the SBA will award up to five cash prizes of $25,000 each.  Additionally, scholarships
  with a value of up to $1,200 each will be issued by the SBA for two representatives
  of each winning organization to attend a 7 week  I-Corps™  in person and virtual
  train the trainer program.  The in person component of the training will take
  place in Washington, DC March 29 through April 1, 2016 and again May 11 through
  14; virtual sessions will take place on April 7, 14, 21, 28, and May 5.  On
  May 14, winners will participate in a forum with I-Corps instructors to discuss
  and refine their customized lean programs which will then be piloted by the
  winners. \r\n\r\nThe scholarships portion of the prize will be disbursed in
  the form of two vouchers for the two representatives from each winning organization
  to attend the I-Corps™ training event in early 2016.  The cash prize portion
  of the award will be disbursed in a series of three payments. The first payment,
  equal to 60 percent of a winner’s total prize amount, will be disbursed upon
  award once all initial requirements in the Official Rules have been met. The
  second payment, equal to 20 percent of a winner's total prize amount, will be
  disbursed after a winner has presented a modified I-Corps™ program to the SBA
  and Agency staff has deemed that solution satisfactory. This solution must be
  presented within six (6) months of the date of the award unless otherwise specified
  by the SBA. The remaining 20 percent of the total prize amount will be disbursed
  after a winner submits a written assessment that includes, but is not limited
  to, the outcomes and outputs of the pilot implementation as measured by the
  metrics outlined in its proposal, a summary of any lessons learned and best
  practices, and suggestions for any improvements to the design or implementation
  of similar competitions in the future. The written assessment must be submitted
  to SBA no later than 12 months after a winner receives its first prize payment."

rules: '<p><u>1. Subject of Challenge Competition</u>: Given the success and growing
  popularity of the National Science Foundation’s I-Corps™ program (see http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/about.jsp),
  the SBA is interested in the potential for using adapted versions of that program
  as a means to assist a broader array of small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs
  operating outside the I-Corps™ program’s current focus on technology-based businesses
  or commercialization concepts. For reference, the I-Corps™ program involves
  expert business trainers helping teams of scientists and entrepreneurs apply
  “lean principles”—a collection of practices and concepts for business model
  analysis—to those scientists’ and entrepreneurs’ nascent entrepreneurial efforts. 
  Given the SBA’s esteem for the success of this program, the SBA has partnered
  with the National Science Foundation (NSF) to offer the Lean for Main Street
  Training Challenge to current SBA Women’s Business Centers, Small Business Development
  Centers, and SCORE Chapters (“Contestants”). Contestants selected as winners
  will participate in the development and deployment of innovative “lean startup”
  resources that can be delivered to small businesses in sectors or regions that
  have not had significant exposure or access to these resources. Winning Contestant
  representatives will participate in an in-person and virtual train-the-trainer 
  program and forum with I-Corps™ national instructors to develop an innovative
  framework for exposing lean methodology to businesses in traditional sectors. 
  Winners will then implement these newly-developed lean training resources to
  businesses in their respective communities on a pilot basis and provide SBA
  with an assessment of their effectiveness.</p>    <p><u>2. Eligibility Rules for Participating
  in the Competition</u>: Only current recipients in good standing of grants and
  cooperative agreements from SBA under the Women’s Business Center, Veterans''
  Business Outreach Center, Small Business Development Center (both lead and service
  centers are eligible), or SCORE programs (“Resource Partners”) are eligible
  to take part in this competition.</p>  To be eligible to win a prize under this

  Selection of Winners</u>:  Winners will be selected based upon how well they
  address the following criteria on their application forms:  <ul>   <li>Audience:
  SBA’s Resource Partners interact with a diverse group of small business owners
  and entrepreneurs. While lean materials aimed towards tech startups are commonly
  available, entrepreneurs in different industries, with different backgrounds,
  or from different geographies may find these materials less applicable to their
  immediate circumstances. In order to be successful, a Contestant should clearly
  identify the specific audience for which their solution would be developed.
  Contestants are free to define their audience according to their own parameters
  (e.g. Sector, Business Phase (pre-venture, startup, existing businesses) Geography,
  Historically Disadvantaged or Underserved Status , etc.)</li>   <li>Adaptation:
  To kick off the adaptation of the I-Corps program, each winner will send two
  representatives to NSF’s I-Corps gathering in Washington, DC, where they will
  work in dedicated groups with I-Corps instructors as part of a specialized Train
  the Trainer program. Applications should outline exactly how representatives
  intend to benefit from this experience, including any specific knowledge gaps
  that representatives are looking to fill through their participation. They should
  also give a clear idea of the demonstrated ability of each representative to
  adapt and deliver new resources to small businesses. Please note that while
  SBA is interested in your knowledge and experience with lean methods, preexisting
  expertise in lean methodology is NOT a requirement for this Competition.</li>   <li>Implementation:
  An entrepreneurial development program is only as good as the people it can
  reach. While the ability to adapt and customize entrepreneurial development
  resources is clearly important, equally important will be the Contestants’ solution
  to delivering their curriculum to small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs
  in their target audience. An application should delineate, as clearly as possible,
  how the Resource Partner intends to leverage their existing relationships, the
  curriculum that they will develop, and the funds awarded to bring lean methods
  into their communities on a pilot basis. Applications should also give a clear
  idea of how they intend to assess the effectiveness of their program, including
  specific metrics that the Resource Partner will track.</li>  </ul></p>  <p><u>7. Applicable

judging-criteria-description-0: SBA’s Resource Partners interact with a diverse
  group of small business owners and entrepreneurs. While lean materials aimed
  towards tech startups are commonly available, entrepreneurs in different industries,
  with different backgrounds, or from different geographies may find these materials
  less applicable to their immediate circumstances. In order to be successful,
  a Contestant should clearly identify the specific audience for which their solution
  would be developed. Contestants are free to define their audience according
  to their own parameters (e.g. Sector, Business Phase (pre-venture, startup,
  existing businesses) Geography,  Historically Disadvantaged or Underserved Status
  , etc.)

judging-criteria-description-1: To kick off the adaptation of the I-Corps program,
  each winner will send two representatives to NSF’s I-Corps gathering in Washington,
  DC, where they will work in dedicated groups with I-Corps instructors as part
  of a specialized Train the Trainer program. Applications should outline exactly
  how representatives intend to benefit from this experience, including any specific
  knowledge gaps that representatives are looking to fill through their participation.
  They should also give a clear idea of the demonstrated ability of each representative
  to adapt and deliver new resources to small businesses. Please note that while
  SBA is interested in your knowledge and experience with lean methods, preexisting
  expertise in lean methodology is NOT a requirement for this Competition.

  entrepreneurial development resources is clearly important, equally important
  will be the Contestants’ solution to delivering their curriculum to small businesses
  and aspiring entrepreneurs in their target audience. An application should delineate,
  as clearly as possible, how the Resource Partner intends to leverage their existing
  relationships, the curriculum that they will develop, and the funds awarded
  to bring lean methods into their communities on a pilot basis.  Applications
  should also give a clear idea of how they intend to assess the effectiveness
  of their program, including specific metrics that the Resource Partner will
  track.

  SBA Announces Winners of Lean for Main Street Training Challenge\r\n
  \r\nWASHINGTON – The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) today announced
  the winners of the “Lean for Main Street Training Challenge” competition. The
  training challenge is designed to give representatives from SBA’s resource partner
  network – Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs), SCORE chapters, Women’s
  Business Centers (WBCs), and Veteran Business Outreach Centers (VBOCs) – the
  opportunity to adapt an existing curriculum to help Main Street small businesses
  and entrepreneurs utilize the insights of lean business methodologies. \r\n
  \r\nLean methodology has been long popular in technology start-ups, driving
  companies to move away from a traditional business plan to a more simplified,
  step-by-step approach.  It involves a cycle of consumer feedback and adaption
  to quickly take products to market.</p>  <p>The SBA has a national network of resource
  partners who are uniquely well positioned to make the most cutting edge tools
  accessible to new businesses in all corners of the country.\r\n \r\n“The lean
  start-up approach has the potential to empower entrepreneurs well beyond Silicon
  Valley and traditional tech hubs,” said SBA Administrator Maria Contreras-Sweet.
  \ “The lean methodology is focused on helping entrepreneurs get the right things
  to the right place at the right time, while minimizing waste and maintaining
  flexibility.  Through a partnership with the National Science Foundation’s I-Corps
  program, we are training and building the capacity of five of those organizations
  to become experts in I-Corps instruction, and we’ll work closely with them as
  they adapt and deliver new variations of the program to targeted audiences in
  their regions.”</p><p>I-Corps, the curriculum developed by the National Science
  Foundation (NSF), provides a framework of principles and practices challenging
  conventional notions about business model planning.\r\n \r\nThe winning resource
  partners will attend NSF’s I-Corps program in Washington, D.C. this spring,
  where they will receive guidance from instructors on how to adapt the curriculum
  to their own communities. Throughout the learning cycle, they will work with
  I-Corps master trainers to observe, reflect, and adapt the current curriculum
  for use in their centers, and in counseling their local area businesses.</p>
  The winners are as follows:<br>•           Community Business Partnership
  (SBDC) – Springfield, Va.<br>•           McLennan SBDC – Waco, Texas<br>•           Renaissance
  Entrepreneurship Center (WBC) – San Francisco, Calif.<br>•           University
  of Pittsburgh (SBDC) – Pittsburgh, Pa.<br>•           Mississippi State University
  (VBOC) – Mississippi State, Miss.<p>Each winning center will also receive
  $25,000 in prize money to support travel expenses associated with the I-Corps
  program, the adaptation and development of a new curriculum, and the delivery
  of that curriculum in their local communities.  The SBA plans to leverage these
  adapted curricula by making them available to all members of the SBA’s resource
  partner network.</p><p>The five winning contestants represent a geographically
  diverse group.  Applicants aimed their proposed curricula at a number of different
  audiences, including disadvantaged Main Street districts, and women from minority
  and immigrant communities.</p>"

  of the Lean for Main Street Training Challenge. Please see
  the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/content/sba-announces-winners-lean-main-street-training-challenge-0"
  target="_blank">press release</a> for winner information. <br>Thank you to all applicants!</strong>     <strong></p><p><em>Note:
  This challenge is limited only to entities that are currently part of SBA’s Resource

  Development Centers (both lead and service centers are eligible), Women’s Business
  Centers, Veteran''s Business Outreach Centers, and SCORE Chapters. Please see the
  Rules section for more information, or contact leanchallenge@sba.gov with additional
  questions.</em></strong></p>    <p>Given the success and growing popularity of the National
  Science Foundation’s I-Corps™ program (see http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/about.jsp),
  the SBA is interested in the potential for using adapted versions of that program
  as a means to assist a broader array of small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs
  operating outside the I-Corps™ program’s current focus on technology-based businesses
  or commercialization concepts.</p> <p>For reference, the I-Corps™ program involves expert
  business trainers helping teams of scientists and entrepreneurs apply “lean principles”—a
  collection of practices and concepts for business model analysis—to those scientists’
  and entrepreneurs’ nascent entrepreneurial efforts.</p> <p>Given the SBA’s esteem for
  the success of this program, the SBA has partnered with the National Science Foundation
  (NSF) to offer the Lean for Main Street Training Challenge to current SBA Women’s
  Business Centers, Small Business Development Centers, and SCORE Chapters (“Contestants”).    Contestants
  selected as winners will participate in the development and deployment of innovative
  “lean startup” resources that can be delivered to small businesses in sectors or
  regions that have not had significant exposure or access to these resources. Winning
  Contestant representatives will participate in an in-person and virtual train-the-trainer 
  program and forum with I-Corps™ national instructors to develop an innovative framework
  for exposing lean methodology to businesses in traditional sectors.</p> <p>Winners will
  then implement these newly-developed lean training resources to businesses in their
  respective communities on a pilot basis and provide SBA with an assessment of their
  effectiveness. For more information, please see the Rules section.</p>'
