    <h4><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></h4>
    <p>Nutrient pollution, one of our most widespread, costly and challenging environmental problems, is caused by excess nitrogen and phosphorus in water.</p>
    <p>Too much nitrogen and phosphorus in the water causes algae to grow faster than ecosystems can handle. This growth &nbsp;causes major environmental damage as well as serious health problems in people and animals.</p>
    <p>Nutrient pollution and resulting algal blooms cost billions, hurting industries and sectors that depend on clean water. Federal, state and local governments spend billions of dollars per year to combat nutrient pollution or prevent its effects.</p>
    <h4><strong>CHALLENGE</strong></h4>
    <p>The Nutrient Sensor Action Challenge builds upon the&nbsp;<em>2014&nbsp;</em><a href="http://www.act-us.info/nutrients-challenge/"><em>Nutrient Sensor Challenge</em></a>, which helped develop affordable, high-performing, continuous nutrient sensors and analyzers. The&nbsp;<em>2017&nbsp;</em>challenge&nbsp;calls for demonstrations showing:</p>
    <p><strong>1)&nbsp;</strong><span>the effective use of low-cost continuous sensors,&nbsp;</span><strong>2)</strong><span>&nbsp;innovative partnerships to pilot the sensors and manage data, and&nbsp;</span><strong>3)</strong><span>&nbsp;how collected information can be used in state and local decision-making &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>By building successful strategies for incorporating nutrient sensors into existing water monitoring efforts, the Challenge can help states and local communities overcome barriers to preventing and reducing nutrient pollution.</p>

    <div><strong>Continuous Nitrate Monitoring on the Galena River:&nbsp; A Basis for Change&nbsp;</strong></div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>Team Lead:&nbsp; Beth Baranski, The League of Women Voters of Jo Daviess County in Illinois</div>
    <div>
    <p>The League of Women Voters of Jo Daviess County in Illinois (LWV-JDC) has been actively seeking water quality data in order to increase&nbsp;local knowledge. The ultimate goal is to achieve science-based stewardship of local water resources. This project proposes that two sensors be deployed, one each at the top and bottom of the Lower Galena River subwatershed to gather continuous data on nitrate levels in this portion of the Galena River. The League has been building relationships throughout the area for over six years and those relationships will provide valuable avenues for communicating the results of the data obtained through continuous nitrate monitoring.&nbsp;&nbsp;These data will be used as a basis for shifting landowners to best management practices designed to reduce nutrient pollution.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Development of a Real-time, Continuous Nutrient Monitoring Network for Western Lake Erie to Address Management of HABs and Hypoxia&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>Team Lead:&nbsp; Thomas Johengen, Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR), University of Michigan&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Since the 1990s, Lake Erie has been experiencing increased water quality impairment, primarily in the form of extensive toxic cyanobacterial blooms.&nbsp; To combat the growing impacts on the ecosystem health and services of these tremendous natural resources, the Governments of Canada and the United States developed revised binational phosphorus reduction targets for Lake Erie with a goal of 40% lower loading rates then established under the 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA).&nbsp;To determine progress toward meeting nutrient reduction targets and verifying the response in the lake, active surveillance of nutrients in the lake is essential. Phosphorus concentrations in Lake Erie are highly variable in time and space, making it difficult to determine long-term trends. Deployment of continuous monitoring sensors to provide nearly continuous data will be a critical component of successful nutrient management.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>High Frequency Nitrogen Sensors in Portland, Maine</strong>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>Team Lead:&nbsp; Curtis C. Bohlen, Casco Bay Estuary Partnership&nbsp;</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>Casco Bay borders Portland and South Portland, Maine's principal economic and technological hub.&nbsp;This project&nbsp;proposes the use high frequency nitrate plus nitrite data collected near Portland's East End to provide data applicable to evaluating the impact of the East End discharges on Casco Bay, clarify the relative importance of riverine inputs, wastewater discharges, stormwater, and combined sewer overflows as sources of nutrients to the waters around Portland, support Maine DEP's RP analyses, provide information on the range of nutrient concentrations experienced by eelgrass beds,&nbsp;and provide data to support development of a better model&nbsp;of nutrient processes in Casco Bay.</div></p>

    <p><strong>Monitoring the Effects of Storms and Conowingo Dam Inputs on Nutrients in the Upper Chesapeake Bay</strong></p>
    <p>Lora Harris (Team Lead) &amp; Jeremy Testa, University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Mike Trice, Maryland Department of Natural Resources</p>
    <p>The Chesapeake Bay estuary has a long history of degraded water quality&nbsp;associated with elevated inputs of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sediments from its large watershed that spans six states and the District of Columbia. The Conowingo Dam, which is located in the lower Susquehanna River - the Bay's largest source of nutrients and freshwater - is decreasingly effective at holding back silt from entering the Upper Chesapeake Bay. As a result, additional nutrients associated with those silts are entering Chesapeake Bay and nutrient and sediment reduction strategies are being developed to address the increased nutrient load. The impact of these "new" nutrient inputs to Chesapeake Bay, however, remains poorly understood. This project would place two sensors in the Upper Chesapeake Bay and provide much data on how the nutrient load changes over time and in response to storm events. This can help validate models and give insight into the effect these nutrients will have on phytoplankton production and associated oxygen depletion in the estuary.</p>

    <p><strong>Quantifying the impact of dam removals on nitrate retention using low cost nitrate sensors</strong></p>
    <p>Team Lead:&nbsp; Dr.Wilfred Wollheim, Department of Natural Resources and Environment, University of New Hampshire</p>
    <p>Current understanding of how reservoirs affect nitrogen moving through river systems is based on a small number of studies in larger reservoirs. These studies also looked at annual estimates rather than evaluating how nutrient retention varied through&nbsp;time. Dams and their reservoirs are increasingly being removed from the landscape, often because they are aging and would need costly repairs, have no significant utility and/or to improve anadromous fish passage and connectivity with spawning areas. Because reservoirs created by dams are potentially effective at removing nitrogen, such dam removals come with tradeoffs, including reduced nitrate removal. We propose to deploy sensors upstream and downstream of several reservoirs in coastal New England to quantify nitrate removal across seasons and storm events. We will&nbsp;also take advantage of ongoing dam removals and management activities to quantify the nitrogen removal by reservoirs.</p>

<h4><strong>E. Data:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>1. Solution Architecture:</strong>&nbsp;Provide a diagram which illustrates the overall configuration of the proposed data solution. The diagram should provide information about how data is taken from the sensor and loaded into the data storage and how the data repository will be accessed for judging (e.g. web services)</p>
<p><strong>2. QA/QC</strong>: Describe how quality assurance and data validation will be addressed</p>
<p><strong>3. Data Sharing</strong>: Teams are required to make the sensor data accessible for judging using web services that follow Open Geospatial Consortium data standards for communicating and sharing continuous monitoring data. (<a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sos">www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sos</a>, <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/waterml">www.opengeospatial.org/standards/waterml</a>). &nbsp;Describe any additional plans for sharing data.</p>
<p><strong>4. Metadata</strong>: &nbsp;Teams are expected to provide metadata that will explain the data content. &nbsp; Describe your metadata approach and identify and describe the naming convention for characterizing the nutrient data. &nbsp; Teams may consider using one of the formats below:</p>
<p>- NOAA/IOOS metadata standards and SOS guidelines:&nbsp;<a href="http://ioos.github.io/sos-guidelines/">http://ioos.github.io/sos-guidelines/</a></p>
