description: "<p>Submissions for this challenge will be accepted on the <a href=\"https://mchbgrandchallenges.hrsa.gov/challenges/remote-pregnancy-monitoring\">Maternal
  and Child Health Bureau Grand Challenges site.</a></p>\r\n<p>The Remote Pregnancy
  Monitoring Challenge will award $375,000 in prizes to support the creation of tech
  innovations to help prenatal care providers remotely monitor the health and wellbeing
  of pregnant women, as well as place health data into the hands of pregnant women
  themselves as a tool to monitor their own health and make informed decisions about
  care. Solutions would especially benefit women who live in rural and medically underserved
  areas who have limited access to on-site prenatal care.</p>\r\n<p>Many women who
  are low-income in both rural and urban communities face barriers in accessing prenatal
  care. And once pregnant, conflicting priorities such as work, child care, and transportation
  make it difficult to make the approximately 15 recommended prenatal visits to their
  provider's office, which include critical medical assessments and instructions about
  self-care. This Challenge is designed to make technology work for pregnant women
  by increasing access to care, improving communications between patients and providers
  and across providers, and empowering pregnant women to take charge of their health
  and their care.</p>"
