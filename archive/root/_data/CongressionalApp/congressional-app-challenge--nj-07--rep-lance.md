  you with updates about the Challenge.</strong>    &nbsp;    The Congressional App
  Challenge is a competition aimed at encouraging U.S. high school students to learn
  how to code by creating their own applications. The Challenge is intended to highlight
  the value of computer science and STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering
  and Math).    The House of Representatives knows how crucial these skills are and
  wants to encourage students to engage in these fields. By encouraging and recognizing
  our nation’s young programming talent, Congress hopes to shine a light on the growing
  importance of these skills.    Please note that this competition is open to all<em> </em>students,
  regardless of coding experience. We strongly encourage students of <em>all</em> skill
  levels to participate, to learn how to create their own apps.    &nbsp;'
