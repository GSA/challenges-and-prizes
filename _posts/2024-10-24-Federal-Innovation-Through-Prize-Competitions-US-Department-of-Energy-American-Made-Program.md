<p>At the Challenge and Prize Community Office Hours in September 2024, we held an Ask Me Anything (AMA) with representatives from the Department of Energy (DOE) American-Made Challenges program. The Challenge.gov team recently hosted a webinar on Federal Innovation Through Prize Competitions with our colleagues at the Department of Energy. We invited the speakers to Office Hours so members of the community could have a deeper discussion about important topics raised at the event.</p>

<p>This conversation led to a great question from a community member from the Department of Justice (USDOJ): what are some ideas and examples of successful non-monetary prizes and incentives?</p> 
<p>Here are some of the creative ideas we discussed: 
<ul>
<li>DOE provides vouchers to small businesses, technology companies, jurisdictions, and manufacturers with access to valuable support services and premier facilities across DOE National Laboratories.</li>
<li>Some agencies set up Partnership Intermediary Agreements (PIA) with winners. PIAs are contracts between government agencies and non-profit, state, or local governments to facilitate technology transfers and commercialization.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>And finally, our colleagues at NASA have lots of fun ideas for non-monetary incentives, including:
  <ul>
<li>Creating digital badges winners can display on social media.</li> 
<li>Flying student artwork in space.</li>
<li>In-person events with agency leadership.</li>
<li>Inviting solvers to Johnson Space Center.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

<p><em>Office Hours are for Federal challenge managers, the Challenge & Prize Community of Practice, and other federal employees interested in learning more about prize competitions. They are held on the 4th Wednesday of the month at 12 pm ET via Zoom.gov. <a href="https://gsa.zoomgov.com/meeting/register/vJIscOuurjkuGRsY2rziMZDcn5cGAVax8XM#/registration">Register here.</a></em></p>
