description: Think about your friends, family, neighbors, and co-workers.  You probably
  know someone with hearing loss—an elderly grandparent or a veteran who served our
  country—and you probably know how hearing loss impacts one’s ability to communicate. 
  According to the Committee on Accessible and Affordable Hearing Health Care for
  Adults, there are 30 million Americans over 12 that have hearing loss, and hearing
  loss worsens as we age.  Many with hearing loss do not seek or receive hearing health
  care because of cost, availability of services, stigma, lack of realization that
  they have hearing loss, and belief that nothing can help them.    While some hearable
  technologies (i.e., hearing aids and assistive listening devices) can enhance hearing
  for many individuals, there are situations where these technologies do not perform
  optimally.  One particularly challenging situation for people with hearing impairment
  is understanding conversation in a noisy environment such as a restaurant.  Inability
  to hear clearly because of background noise and intermittent peaks in noise makes
  following a conversation difficult.  Amplification of speech sounds will also amplify
  the background noise.    The National Science Foundation seeks solutions to process
  audio data to augment speech recognition in noisy environments.  The goal of this
  challenge is to demonstrate solutions such as algorithms or methods that improve
  clarity of conversation in a noisy setting.
