   <strong> </strong>    <b>PRIZES:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  GSA may
  award prizes of no more than $1,000 to each member of a winning team (3 team’s
  total).  GSA is not required to award all prizes if the judges determine that
  a smaller number of entries meet the scope and requirements laid out for this
  competition, or if the agency only plans to use code from a smaller number of
  entries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:
  400;"> </span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding for the Grace Hopper
  Day Hackathon awards will come from GSA. Prizes will be awarded to each member
  of a winning team via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), within 60 days of announcing
  the winner(s). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>    <b>ELIGIBILITY:</b><span
  style="font-weight: 400;">  Eligibility to participate in the Grace Hopper Day
  Hackathon and win a prize is limited to entities/individuals:</span>  <ul>    <li
  style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That have registered
  to participate in the competition and complied with the rules of the competition
  as explained in this posting; and</span></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li style="font-weight:
  400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That have been incorporated in and maintain
  a primary place of business in the United States.  In the case of an individual,
  whether participating singly or in a group, the participant must be a citizen
  or permanent resident of the United States. Participants must be at least </span><b>18</b><span
  style="font-weight: 400;"> years of age to participate in this event. </span></li>  </ul>  <span
  style="font-weight: 400;">Participants may not be a federal entity or federal
  employee acting within the scope of employment. However, an individual or entity
  shall not be deemed ineligible to win prize money because the individual or
  entity used federal facilities or consulted with federal employees during a
  competition if the facilities and employees are made available to all individuals
  and entities participating in the competition on an equitable basis.</span>    <span
  style="font-weight: 400;">Participants agree to assume any and all risks and
  waive claims against the federal government and its related entities, except
  in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of
  property, revenue, or profits, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising
  from participation in this competition, whether the injury, death, damage, or
  loss arose through negligence or otherwise.  Entrants are not required to obtain
  liability insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility in order to participate
  in this Hackathon. </span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">As the federal
  government is under a strict duty not to give preferential treatment to any
  private organization or individual, participants must agree to take diligent
  care to avoid the appearance of federal government endorsement of competition
  participation and submission.  Participants must agree not to refer to the federal
  government’s use of their submission (be it product or service) in any commercial
  advertising or similar promotions in a manner that could reasonably imply (in
  the judgment of a reasonable person) that the GSA or the federal government
  endorses, prefers, sponsors, or has an affiliation with participants’ products
  or services.  </span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants agree
  that GSA’s trademarks, logos, service marks, trade names, or the fact that GSA
  awarded a prize to a participant, shall not be used by the participant to imply
  direct GSA endorsement of participant or participant’s submission.  Both participants
  and GSA may list the other party’s name in a publicly available customer or
  other list so long as the name is not displayed in a more prominent fashion
  than any other third-party name.</span>    <b>REQUIREMENTS:</b><span style="font-weight:
  400;">  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final solution should be
  open source code submitted as a pull request to the https://github.com/GSA/open-gsa-redesign
  GitHub repository.</span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Open source” refers
  to a program in which the source code is available to the general public for
  use and/or modification from its original design free of charge.  In order to
  be Open Source Initiative Certified, the solution must meet the following nine
  criteria:</span>  <ol>    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The author or
  holder of the license of the source code cannot collect royalties on the distribution
  of the code. </span></li>    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distributed
  software must make the source code accessible to the user. </span></li>    <li><span
  style="font-weight: 400;">The author must allow modifications and derivations
  of the work under the software’s original name. </span></li>    <li><span style="font-weight:
  400;">No person, group, or field of endeavor can be denied access to the software.
  </span></li>    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rights attached to the
  software must not depend on the software being part of a particular software
  distribution.</span></li>    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The licensed
  software cannot place restrictions on other software that is distributed with
  it.</span></li>    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution must be
  an online, interactive solution that meets the goals and objectives provided
  in this document.</span></li>    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution
  must include documentation of all data sources used.</span></li>    <li>The
  solution must include a description of how the solution can be updated with
  additional data from other agencies, if applicable.</li>  </ol>  <span style="font-weight:
  400;">The winner(s) of the competition will, in consideration of the prize(s)
  to be awarded, grant to GSA a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license
  to use any and all intellectual property to the winning entry for any governmental
  purpose, including the right to permit such use by any other agency or agencies
  of the federal government.  All other rights of the winning entrant will be
  retained by the winner of the competition.</span>    <b>SCOPE:</b><span style="font-weight:
  400;">  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any federal data and information
  that is publicly available is included in the scope of this challenge.  </span>    <b>JUDGES:</b><span
  style="font-weight: 400;">  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will
  be a panel of judges, each with expertise in government-wide policy, information

description: 'In celebration of one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I
  computer in 1944, we are inviting you to join us for the Grace Hopper Day Hackathon.
  Grace was an innovative, out-of-the-box thinker and doer and her legacy reflects
  this. Grace invented the first compiler for a computer programming language, and
  was one of those who popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages
  which led to the development of COBOL, one of the first high-level programming languages.    We
  are holding a competition for all open source contributors to redesign the GSA Open
  website, open.gsa.gov. Open.gsa.gov is the current developer portal for all GSA
  data, APIs, and source code open to the public. This competition is hosted by GSA’s
  IT Digital Services team and will be held on Friday, December 9, 2016, to coincide
  with Grace Hopper''s birthday.    The goal of this redesign is to improve public
  engagement with GSA''s digital assets and increase understanding and awareness of
  agency open technology. GSA is challenging developers and designers from industry,
  academia and federal government to create solutions using the site product roadmap
  provided on the competition details webpage.    <strong>DATES: </strong>Online registration
  for this event will open on November 22, 2016<strong>,</strong> and will close Tuesday,
  December 6, 2016, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST).  The competition will
  take place on Friday, December 9, 2016, from 9:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard
  Time (EST); check in will begin at 8:00 a.m. (EST).    <strong>ADDRESSES:  </strong>  <ul>    <li><u>Registration</u><strong>: 
  </strong>Registration for this event will be accomplished online at the following
  link: <a href="http://open.gsa.gov/grace-hopper-hackathon">http://open.gsa.gov/grace-hopper-hackathon</a>.
  The event space is limited to the first 100 people; once registration is complete,
  participants will receive a confirmation email.</li>    <li><u>Event Location</u>:

  Avenue, NW, Washington, DC, 20408.  The National Archives Building is located between
  Seventh and Ninth Streets, NW. Participants are to enter through the Pennsylvania
  Avenue entrance. A government-issued ID shall be  required to gain access into the
  building.</li>  </ul>  <strong>PURPOSE:</strong> In this competition, participants
  are asked to redesign the GSA Open website, open.gsa.gov. This website is the current
  developer portal for GSA data, APIs, and source code open to the public.    <strong>DETAILS
  OF CHALLENGE: </strong>Participants will be asked to redesign the current developer
  portal open.gsa.gov. The solution should be a usability-driven feature to encourage
  public engagement with the site and GSA digital assets. Predetermined teams (consisting
  of up to <strong>five</strong> individuals) are welcome to include a stand-alone
  or mix of private industry, academia, and eligible individuals.  Cash prizes will
  be awarded to the best projects.    <strong>DATA: </strong>Event information will
  be posted on the event page at <a href="http://open.gsa.gov/grace-hopper-hackathon/">http://open.gsa.gov/grace-hopper-hackathon/</a>.    <strong>PROJECT</strong>:
