rules: "<p><span lang=\"EN\">By the Challenge deadline, Solvers should submit
  a white paper submission detailing the proposed method for continuous streamflow
  monitoring, including a thorough description of the physical principles underlying
  the proposed method, all equipment and operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) procedures
  required to implement the method, and estimated costs.&nbsp; The total award
  for the Stage I Challenge is $75,000.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Submissions
  to this Challenge must be received by 11:59 PM (US Eastern Time) on April 8,
  2019.&nbsp; Late submissions will not be accepted.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If
  Stage I produces winning concepts and Reclamation determines future competitions
  would be beneficial, Reclamation may launch subsequent staged challenges contingent
  on the outcome of previous stages and on availability of funds.&nbsp; A possible
  Stage 2 of this challenge is envisioned to be reduction-to-practice challenge
  seeking the development of prototype systems to be tested in a controlled environment
  such as a hydraulics laboratory, canal, regulated stream channel (e.g., stream
  channel below a dam), or other location where flow and measurement conditions
  can be well regulated. Testing will focus on verifying that the prototype system
  functions as intended and provides accurate measurements under controlled conditions.&nbsp;
  A possible Stage 3 challenge would also be a reduction-to-practice challenge
  seeking the development of prototype systems to be tested in the field. Testing
  in Stage 3 will focus on evaluating the prototype systems under a broader range
  of flow and environmental conditions. The anticipated total award for Stages
  2 and 3 is $450,000. Stage 2 and 3 would be shaped based on the outcome of the
  previous stage.&nbsp; Participation in Stage 1 would not be required to be eligible
  to participate in future stages.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">After the
  Challenge submission deadline, a Judging Panel of subject matter experts will
  evaluate the submissions and decide which Solvers are selected for an award
  in Stage 1 of this Challenge. The Judging Panel may be composed of Federal and/or
  Non-Federal scientists, engineers, and other technical experts, including subject
  matter experts from the listed collaborators for this Challenge.&nbsp; All persons
  or entities that submit a proposal will be notified on the status of the submissions.&nbsp;
  Decisions by Reclamation cannot be contested.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>Eligibility</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">To receive an award in Stage 1 of this Challenge, the Solvers will
  not have to transfer their exclusive IP rights to Reclamation. Instead, Solvers
  will grant to Reclamation a non-exclusive license to practice their solutions.
  The Solver will not receive an Award if Solver cannot provide Reclamation with
  the non-exclusive license to the Solution IP on the terms set forth in the Challenge-Specific
  Agreement. Solvers who have transferred their IP rights in their solution to
  another party, or otherwise entered into any commercial exclusive arrangement
  with another for the exploitation of their IP rights in their solution prior
  to the end of the Challenge shall not be eligible for a Challenge award.&nbsp;
  Please note that any proposal submitted will not be treated as confidential
  information.&nbsp; Accordingly, Solvers should take whatever steps they deem
  necessary to protect their proprietary rights in their solutions prior to submitting
  their written proposal for consideration in the Challenge (e.g. filing provisional
  or full patent applications on the solution described in the written proposal
  submitted prior to submission).&nbsp; See the Challenge-Specific Agreement for
  full details.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This Challenge is being conducted
  by Reclamation under the authority of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act
  of 2010 (15 U.S. Code &sect; 3719) as amended by the American Innovation and
  Competitiveness Act of 2017, which states that cash prize purse awards for this
  prize competition may only be given to an individual that is a citizen or permanent
  resident of the United States, or an entity that is incorporated in and whose
  primary place of business is in the United States, subject to verification before
  cash prize purses are awarded. </span></p>\r\n<p><strong> <span lang=\"EN\">Cash
  prize purse payments:</span></strong><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp; Payments will
  be paid in full to the eligible registered individual, entity, or team selected
  as a winner.<br /><br /><strong>Registering as a team:</strong>&nbsp; Teams
  must register to compete by having the Team Leader form a Team Project Room.&nbsp;
  The Team Leader must be a U.S. citizen, permanent U.S. resident, or representative
  of a U.S. entity eligible to receive a cash prize.&nbsp; In the case of a team
  registration, the cash prize purse can be split and paid directly to eligible
  team members as directed by the registered eligible team leader.&nbsp; The Reclamation

description: "<p><span lang=\"EN\">The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and US
  Geological Survey (USGS) are seeking new and innovative methods to significantly
  reduce the cost of continuous streamflow monitoring compared to current methods.&nbsp;
  The prize purse for this Stage I challenge is $75,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; Future stages
  are envisioned including lab and field testing of prototype systems.</span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">This Stage I challenge is a theoretical competition seeking a white
  paper submission detailing the proposed method for continuous streamflow monitoring,
  including a thorough description of the physical principles underlying the proposed
  method, all equipment and operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) procedures required
  to implement the method, and estimated costs.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Water
  resources planning, management, and research rely extensively on accurate and reliable
  streamflow data. Long-term streamflow records, for example, are critical to the
  design of water supply and flood control projects, as well as infrastructure in
  and adjacent to stream channels. Similarly, water managers rely on real-time streamflow
  data to support water supply and flood control operations, including forecast and
  early warning systems for droughts and floods. Long-term and real-time streamflow
  data also support a broad range of water resources and environmental research. <br
  /><br />Despite the importance of streamflow data, the existing network of continuous
  streamflow monitoring stations (also referred to as stream gages) in the United
  States has generally declined over the past several decades. The number of stream
  gages operated by the US Geological Survey peaked in the late 1960s and declined
  nearly 20% by the late 1990s. The primary driver of this decline is the cost of
  installing, operating, and maintaining stream gages. Between 2000 and 2009, additional
  funding was made available to reactivate approximately half of the deactivated gages;
  however, the cost of installing, operating, and maintaining stream gages remains
  a significant challenge to Federal, Tribal, State, and local water agencies.<br
  /><br />This prize competition seeks new methods or technologies to significantly
  reduce the equipment and/or labor costs of continuous streamflow monitoring. Methods
  must be applicable to continuous monitoring of the volumetric flow rate of water
  in open channels, including natural channels (e.g., streams and rivers) and engineered
  channels (e.g., aqueducts, canals, and drainage channels). Methods should be applicable
  across wide range of flow rates, channel sizes, and channel geometries, and the
  accuracy and reliability of methods should be comparable or better than current
  methods.<br /><br />A brief video describing this Challenge can be found <a href=\"https://www.usbr.gov/research/challenges/streamflow.html\">here</a>.<br
  /><!--[endif]--></span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Challenge is set to launch Friday,
  February 22, 2019, 12:00 PM ET.&nbsp; Submissions will be accepted for 45 days (concludes
  April 8, 2019 at 11:59 PM ET).</span></p>"
