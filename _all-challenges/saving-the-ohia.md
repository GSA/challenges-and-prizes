description: "<p>Devastating fungi are killing Hawaii&rsquo;s iconic ʻŌhiʻa trees.</p>\r\n<p>Countless
  native species depend&nbsp;on the shade of the ʻŌhiʻa for their growth. Without
  its presence, native birds will lose a roosting habitat, and rainfall will erode
  the Hawaii's delicate island soils. Even the cycle of creation after a lava flow
  would be disrupted without the ʻŌhiʻa to help bring life back to the land.</p>\r\n<p>Are
  you ready to invent a way to help us find the fungus before it wipes out this hallmark
  of Hawaii's landscape? Take up the challenge, be a HERO, win up $70,000, and establish
  yourself as a leader in the fungus world!</p>\r\n<h4><strong>The Challenge</strong></h4>\r\n<p><a

  width=\"500\" alt=\"Incidences of ceratocystis confirmed in 2017 and before, video launch on conservation efforts to save Hawaii's sacred tree, the Ohi'a\"/></a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.savetheohia.org\" target=\"_blank\"
  rel=\"noopener\">Saving the ʻŌhiʻa</a> is an innovation competition that seeks novel
  turn-key tools and creative solutions to rapidly and inexpensively detect the fungal
  species <em>Ceratocystis lukuohia</em> and <em>Ceratocystis huliohia</em> in asymptomatic
  trees (i.e., trees that do not show signs of infection) as well as at the landscape
  scale in larger stands. We also seek tools that can detect the potential invasion
  transmission pathways (e.g., wind, streams, transported soil, forest products, tools,
  equipment, etc.) and potential reservoirs of the fungi that lead to its spread.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Help
  Others Develop Their Solutions</strong></h4>\r\n<p>We encourage applicants to create
  a project profile in Conservation X Labs Digital Makerspace <a href=\"http://www.conservationx.com\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://conservationx.com/</a> to assist the
  applicant in the development of their proposed solution to the Challenge.</p>\r\n<p>The
  Digital Makerspace is an online open community working toward creating tech solutions
  for conservation's greatest problems. Please see a detailed description of the <a
  href=\"https://www.savetheohia.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ohi'a Challenge</a>
  at the Conservation X Lab page. Note:&nbsp;The application needs to be submitted
  through \"Submit\" function on Challenge.gov.</p>"
