description: "<strong>HHS Announces Health Data Provenance Challenge Winners</strong>
  \   &nbsp;    The Department of Health and Humans Services Office of the National
  Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) today announced the Phase 2
  winners of the “Oh the Places Data Goes: Health Data Provenance” Challenge.    The
  winning solutions were submitted by 1upHealth and RAIN Live Oak Technology.  1upHealth
  piloted the use of its partner’s provider application to surface provenance information
  and help providers find aggregated data from various sources using Fast Health Interoperability
  Resources (FHIR) along with proposed improvements afforded by smart contracts on
  the blockchain’s public ledger.    RAIN Live Oak created a software toolkit enabling
  health information systems of any size to integrate provenance into their data-flow
  without disrupting existing practices or data repository requirements.    Provenance
  of data is important in making sure that the person or entity that receives the
  information can be confident in the authenticity, trustworthiness, and reliability
  of the data – and the organization or person that originally sent the data electronically
  is just as trustworthy. The winners of Phase 2 of the challenge submitted a recorded
  demonstration, solution guide, and lessons learned focused on prototyping and testing
  the effectiveness of their solution.    The need for health data provenance, and
  standard approaches to capture it, is an important priority across the health information
  technology system. It is complex and plays a role in almost everything related to
  the use and exchange of electronic data. The winning submissions demonstrated some
  innovative and standardized solutions that could lead to improvements in the provenance
  of health data will help the healthcare industry better maximize health data that
  is already digitized and ready to share."
