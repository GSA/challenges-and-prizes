  1: Integrated Chemistry Database for Translational Innovation in Pain, Opioid
  Use Disorder and Overdose.</strong> The first Challenge rewards and spurs solutions
  to the development of an open-source, controlled-access database that will contain
  extensive chemical, biological and clinical data on currently available pain
  drugs, opioids and treatments for addiction and overdose. The database should
  include but is not limited to the structures of known analgesics and opioids;
  information on the corresponding drug targets and, if available, known/predicted
  mechanisms of action; information on the structure and chemical synthesis; available
  in vitro and in vivo biological screening data; and any clinical data relevant
  to the effectiveness, as well as side effects, including risk of addiction etc.
  In order to serve its purpose of the <strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges,
  all deposited information (including chemical structures, published chemical
  synthesis steps and conditions, safety data, etc.) is required to be in a format
  that is suitable for use in training and validating advanced machine learning
  applications. The data can be aggregated from available public (assembled from
  publications and public databases) and/or private (including industry-based
  collaborators) sources. If using data from non-public sources, innovators must
  provide the license and terms under which such data are provided for this Challenge.
  Pursuant to Rule 15 of the Challenge, by participating in this Challenge, each
  individual (whether participating singly or in a group) assures NCATS that any
  data used for the purpose of submitting an entry for this Challenge competition
  were obtained legally through authorized access to such data. It is expected
  that the developed database will be utilized by other innovators in other <strong>NCATS
  ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges during the Reduction-to-Practice stage that
  is envisioned to follow the Design Challenge.</p>\r\n<h4>Judging criteria:</h4>\r\n<h4>Evaluation

description: "<h3><strong>SUMMARY OF NCATS ASPIRE DESIGN CHALLENGE 1</strong></h3>\r\n<h4><strong>Integrated
  Chemistry Database for Translational Innovation in Pain, Opioid Use Disorder and
  Overdose</strong></h4>\r\n<p><strong>Challenge 1</strong> aims to address the need
  for an open source, controlled access database that incorporates all currently available
  chemical, biological and clinical data of known opioid and non-opioid based analgesics,
  drugs of abuse, and drugs used to treat drug abuse. This challenge requires submission
  of only a detailed description of the design of a database, not the final working
  database. In order to serve the purpose of the <strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong> Program,
  the database should be highly disease-specific (focusing only on opioid and non-opioid
  based analgesics, drugs of abuse, and drugs used to treat drug abuse), but able
  to be adapted for scalability and/or use for other disorders; &nbsp;data and data
  management system could be accessed and utilized using an application programming
  interface (API); the database should offer effective visualizations through a built-in
  graphical user interface (GUI) representing an analytics dashboard and/or an external
  porting mechanism to other visualization tools; and it should offer functionality
  that facilitates data use in training and validating advanced machine learning algorithms
  or applications developed in Challenge 3.The design should address the following
  judging criteria and will be evaluated based on the potential to achieve these criteria.
  &nbsp;Winners from this challenge will be strongly encouraged to develop their designs
  to compete in an envisioned follow-up reduction-to-practice challenge.</p>\r\n<p>Evaluation
  criteria that reviewers will be asked to address are specified under the \"Judging
  Criteria\" tab.</p>\r\n<p>For complete details on the challenge,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ncats.nih.gov/aspire/challenges/challenge1\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">visit the NCATS ASPIRE Design Challenge 1 details
  page</a>.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>About NCATS ASPIRE Design Challenges</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The
  National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), part of the National
  Institutes of Health (NIH) is inviting novel design solutions for A Specialized
  Platform for Innovative Research Exploration (<strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong>) Challenges
  as part of the <strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong> Program. The goal of the <strong>NCATS
  ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges is to reward and spur innovative and catalytic
  approaches towards solving the opioid crisis through development of: (1) novel chemistries;
  (2) data-mining and analysis tools and technologies; and (3) biological assays that
  will revolutionize discovery, development and pre-clinical testing of next generation,
  safer and non-addictive analgesics to treat pain, as well as new treatments for
  opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose. The first phase of these prize competitions
  is implemented through a suite of concurrent companion design challenges that comprises
  a separate challenge for each of four areas: chemistry database, electronic laboratory
  knowledge portal for synthetic chemistry, algorithms, and biological assays; and
  an additional challenge for a combined solution to at least two Challenge areas.
  At this stage, innovators are expected to submit designs, not final products or
  prototypes. NCATS envisions following these design challenges with a follow-on,
  but distinct, final reduction-to-practice challenge, which will aim to invoke further
  scientific and technological development of the model system. Winners of the design
  challenges will be invited to present their designs so that, in the envisioned follow-up
  Reduction-to-Practice Challenge, an open competition, teams will be able to form
  multi-disciplinary collaborations to advance and integrate the most feasible and
  promising approaches to the multiple challenges into a single integrative platform.
  Innovators will be invited to demonstrate final solutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>NCATS
  ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges are part of the of the NIH&rsquo;s Helping to
  End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national
  opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative will bolster research across
  NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain
  management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at: &nbsp;<a
  href=\"https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative.\">https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative.</a></p>\r\n<p>NCATS
  refers to participants in the <strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges as
  &ldquo;innovators&rdquo; because all solutions will require highly innovative approaches
  to achieve success. &nbsp;Innovators should clearly state how and why the proposed
  solution would provide significant advances over currently available tools. Innovators
  may choose to compete in one or more individual challenges to address a single area
  (Challenges 1-4) or propose a combined solution for at least two Challenge areas
  (Challenge 5).</p>\r\n<p><p>For further information send an email to <a
