  lang=\"EN\">The Million Hearts&reg; Hypertension Control Challenge is open to
  public and private individual clinicians, practices, and health systems providing
  health care services to patients in a U.S. state or territory. To be eligible
  to be recognized as a Hypertension Control Champion, the applicant must:</span></p>\r\n<p>1.
  Be a U.S. licensed clinician, practicing in any U.S. setting, who provides continuing
  care for adult patients with hypertension. In the case of an individual, whether
  participating singly or in a group, the individual must be a citizen or permanent
  resident of the United States.</p>\r\n<p>2. Or be a U.S. incorporated clinical
  practice, defined as any practice with two or more U.S. licensed clinicians
  who by formal arrangement share responsibility for a common panel of patients,
  practice at the same physical location or street address, and provide continuing
  medical care for adult patients with hypertension.</p>\r\n<p>3. Or be a health
  system, incorporated in and maintaining a primary place of business in the U.S.
  that provides continuing medical care for adult patients with hypertension.</p>\r\n<p>4.
  In the case of a private entity, the private entity shall be incorporated in
  and maintain a primary place of business in the U.S.</p>\r\n<p>5. The United
  States means a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
  and any other territory or possession of the United States.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">In addition, the clinician, practice, or health system:</span></p>\r\n<p>1.
  Must treat all adult patients with hypertension in the practice seeking care,
  not a select subgroup of patients.</p>\r\n<p>2. Must treat a minimum of 500
  adult patients (aged 18 years and older) annually.</p>\r\n<p>3. Must have completed
  the application form in its entirety.</p>\r\n<p>4. Must have a data management
  system (electronic or paper) that allows CDC or their contractor to verify data
  submitted.</p>\r\n<p>5. Must have a hypertension control rate of at least 80%

  patient population. Must have a data management system (electronic or paper)
  that allows for verification of data submitted.</p>\r\n<p>6. Must agree to:</p>\r\n<p
  style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">a. Participate in a data validation process to
  be conducted by a reputable independent contractor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Data will be
  kept confidential by the contractor to the extent applicable law allows and
  will be shared with the CDC, in aggregate form only (e.g., the hypertension
  control rate for the practice not individual patients&rsquo; hypertension values).</p>\r\n<p
  style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">b. Sign, without revisions, a HIPAA compliance
  Business Associate Agreement with the contractor conducting the data validation.</p>\r\n<p
  style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">c. Be recognized if selected and agree to participate
  in an interview to develop a success story that describes the systems and processes
  that support hypertension control among patients. Champions will be recognized
  on the Million Hearts&reg; website. Strategies used by Champions that support
  hypertension control may be written into a success story, placed on the Million
  Hearts&reg; website, and attributed to Champions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:
  30px;\">d. Provide information through a 60 minute, or other similar, interview
  about their clinical strategies and protocol implementation for the development
  of a success story document.</p>\r\n<p>7. Individual applicants and individuals
  in a group practice must be free from convictions or pending investigations
  of criminal and health care fraud offenses such as felony health care fraud,
  patient abuse or neglect; free of felony convictions for other health care-related
  fraud, theft, or other financial misconduct; and felony convictions relating
  to unlawful manufacture, distribution, prescribing, or dispensing of controlled
  substances as verified through the <a href=\"http://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/background.asp\">Office
  of the Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals and Entities</a>.&nbsp;Individual
  applicants must be free from serious sanctions, such as those for misuse or
  mis-prescribing of prescription medications. Such serious sanctions will be
  determined at the discretion of CDC consistent with CDC&rsquo;s public health
  mission. CDC&rsquo;s contractor may perform background checks on individual
  clinicians or medical practices.</p>\r\n<p>8. Eligibility status of individual
  applicants with serious sanctions will be determined at the discretion of CDC.</p>\r\n<p><!--
  [if !supportLists]-->9.&nbsp;<!--[endif]-->Health systems must have a written
  policy in place about conducting periodic background checks on all providers
  and taking appropriate action based on the results of the check. CDC&rsquo;s
  contractor may also request to review the policy and any supporting information
  deemed necessary. In addition, a health system background check will be conducted
  by CDC or a CDC contractor that includes a search for The Joint Commission sanctions
  and current investigations for serious institutional misconduct (e.g., attorney
  general investigation). Eligibility status, based upon the above-referenced
  written policy, appropriate action, and background check, will be determined
  at the discretion of CDC consistent with CDC&rsquo;s public health mission.
  The background check should ensure that staff are free from convictions of pending
  investigations of criminal and health care fraud offenses such as felony health
  care fraud, patient abuse or neglect; felony convictions for other health care-related
  fraud, theft, or other financial misconduct; and felony convictions relating
  to unlawful manufacture, distribution prescribing, or dispensing of controlled
  substances as verified through the <a href=\"http://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/background.asp\">Office
  of the Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals and Entities</a>.&nbsp;The
  policy must ensure that staff are free from serious sanctions, such as those
  for misuse or mis-prescribing of prescription medication. Such serious sanctions
  well be determined at the discretion of the CDC consistent with CDC&rsquo;s
  public health mission.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->10.&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Centers

  information includes:</span></p>\r\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->1.&nbsp;<!--[endif]-->The
  size of the applicant&rsquo;s adult patient population defined as the number
  of adult patients (age 18 years and older) served during the reporting year
  regardless of diagnosis, a summary of known patient demographics (e.g., age
  distribution), and any noteworthy patient population characteristics. The reporting
  year (continuous 12-months) should reflect the most currently available data
  with an end date no earlier than 3 months prior to the date of submission.</p>\r\n<p><!--
  [if !supportLists]-->2.&nbsp;<!--[endif]-->The percent of the applicant&rsquo;s
  adult patient population identified above that were seen during the reporting
  year and had a hypertension diagnosis (i.e., hypertension prevalence). There
  are an estimated 11 million people who are unaware of their hypertension. Most
  of these people are hiding in plain sight&mdash;they are in clinical treatment
  with elevated blood pressure documented, but hypertension is neither diagnosed
  nor treated. Applicants selected as finalists will have their reported hypertension
  prevalence (i.e., percentage of their practice or system population with the
  condition) assessed for alignment with their predicted hypertension prevalence.
  Initially, a rough estimate of the applicant&rsquo;s predicted hypertension
  prevalence will be calculated using the reported age distribution of their patient
  population and hypertension prevalence findings from national studies, using
  the Million Hearts&reg; Hypertension Prevalence Estimator Tool <span lang=\"EN\"><a

  If the applicant&rsquo;s reported prevalence varies considerably from this rough
  estimate, the applicant may be asked to describe possible reasons for this disparity
  during the data validation process. If the reported hypertension prevalence
  is extreme and there is not a justifiable reason, the applicant may be excluded
  from further participation in the Challenge.</p>\r\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->3.&nbsp;<!--[endif]-->The
  hypertension control rate should be for the provider&rsquo;s or health system&rsquo;s
  entire adult hypertensive patient population, ages 18-85, not limited to a sample.
  The provider&rsquo;s or health system&rsquo;s hypertensive population age 18-85
  should include only patients in primary care or in cardiology care in the case
  of a cardiology clinic. Patients seen only in dental care or behavioral health
  care should not be included.&nbsp; Examples of ineligible data submissions include
  hypertension control rates that are limited to treatment cohorts from research
  studies or pilot studies, patients limited to a specific age range (such as
  18-35), or patients enrolled in limited scale quality improvement projects.</p>\r\n<p><!--

  90 mmHg diastolic among adult hypertensive patients ages 18-85.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><!--
  [if !supportLists]-->6.&nbsp;<!--[endif]-->A description of clinic systems or

  phase 2 consists of a medical chart review. In addition, background checks will
  be conducted by an independent source for individual or small practice applicants
  to ensure there are no serious sanctions or that other misconduct has occurred
  (as outlined in the Eligibility section). For large providers or health systems,
  their background check policy and implementation will be reviewed for compliance

  the criteria used to include patients as \"controlled\" and a list with each
  hypertensive patient found to have blood pressure in control. Thirty patient
  records will be selected randomly for file review for compliance. For the thirty
  records selected, electronic copies of all of the pertinent medical records
  will be submitted through a secure FTP site with a secure login. Criteria for
  compliance with the measure include having documentation of having at least
  one outpatient encounter with a diagnosis of hypertension during the first 6
  months of the measurement period and evidence that the patient&rsquo;s most
  recent blood pressure is adequately controlled (a reading of &lt;140/&lt;90
