    <p>Data collection and capture are fundamental to water and environmental science and management. Scientists, engineers, and technicians are increasingly using mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones to capture data in the field. Numerous apps are available to support general data collection, however existing apps do not provide the functionality and flexibility needed to support the broad range of water and environmental monitoring needs. More importantly, these existing apps do not support the development and sharing of new features and functions by individual users and communities of practice.</p>
    <p>The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey, is seeking development of an application (app) framework to support electronic data collection and capture using mobile devices across a diverse range of data collection situations. The app framework should be flexible, extensible, and open source to enable future improvement and development of added features by a community of app developers and users. This Ideation Challenge is the first (Stage 1) of a planned three-stage Challenge.</p>
    <p>This Ideation stage asks for ideas focusing on identifying robust and efficient software architecture concepts and software technologies for development of the desired app framework.</p>
