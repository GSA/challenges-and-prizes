  Protecting the public from heat-related illness and death during extreme heat
  events or in connection with other disasters is an important part of disaster
  preparedness and resilience and the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS)
  mission. This Challenge is seeking innovative climate-friendly cooling
  solutions that can provide access to cooling to people in public and
  residential areas. DHS is looking for novel ways to protect those at risk of
  heat-related illness or death, including first responders, households or group
  quarters without access to conventional cooling systems or experiencing
  sustained power outages, and displaced or homeless populations. Relative to
  current cooling solutions, these new designs will be more eco-friendly and
  energy efficient, while being cost effective, scalable, durable, and allowing
  for alternate power sources. These features will make them well suited for
  mitigating emerging risks associated with extreme heat conditions from or
  during disasters. Cascading impacts resulting from catastrophic damages or
  loss of power during disasters exacerbate risks of heat-related illness, when
  conventional air conditioning (A/C) is not available during extreme heat
  conditions. Climate change is also driving local heat events that exceed
  historic temperature extremes. During heat events, those at the greatest risk
  of heat-related illness include infants and young children; people 65 years of
  age or older; people with illnesses or chronic health conditions; and homeless
  or displaced populations. First responders or those required to work outdoors
  in support of community lifelines are also at risk for heat-related illness or
  require solutions to support encounters with heat-related illness. 


  This Challenge is part of the DHS’s effort to implement a proactive approach to climate change adaptation and resilience. This will be the first in a series of Challenges to address hazards posed by extreme weather due to climate change.


  **BACKGROUND**


  Promoting national resilience against the many threats associated with climate change, including extreme heat, is a DHS priority.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),[ extreme heat events have become more common across the United States](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-heat-related-deaths) in recent decades and are expected to become more common, more severe, and longer lasting as global temperatures continue to rise.


  Extreme heat events and their effects significantly impact the United States. Extreme heat events are one of the leading causes of [weather-related deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/features/trackingheat/index.html) in the United States, and a reason for many emergency departments visits and hospital stays.  For example, record-breaking heat indexes in the Pacific Northwest in June 2021 caused more than [2,500 people to seek emergency department treatment for heat-related illness](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7029e1.htm?s_cid=mm7029e1_w).  In addition to causing extreme heat events, rising global temperatures produce extreme weather conducive to wildfires, flooding, and hurricanes, and that extreme weather can have large cascading effects of extended power outages coupled with high temperatures. This is causing large populations in communities across the country to be more vulnerable to heat-related illness. In the wake of the extended power outages caused by Hurricane Ida, for example, [Louisiana has recorded several heat-related deaths](https://weather.com/news/news/2021-09-09-heat-hurricane-ida-new-orleans-louisiana-power-outages).


  There are some simple [safety measures](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/features/trackingheat/index.html) that people can take to protect themselves from heat-related illnesses or death, including avoiding unnecessary sun exposure, avoiding unnecessary hard work or activities outdoors, drinking water often, wearing light and loose-fitting clothing, and staying in an air-conditioned area during the hottest hours of the day.  However, many Americans who experience extreme heat events lack access to conventional air conditioning.  Solutions are needed to protect them, and to do so in an energy-efficient, user-friendly, and cost-effective way.

  awarding of cash prizes.  


  Submissions should explain how well the proposed solution(s) address the cooling problem and use cases based on the criteria below for both Stage 1 and Stage 2. Overall, the judging will consider how user-friendly (easy-to-install or retro-fit and easy-to-use) and cost effective the solution is, and how well it meets the judging criteria. 


  Stage 1 Finalists will be based on how well the proposed solution(s) addresses the cooling problem and Use Cases including:


  * How well does the submission address the problem and criteria?  This can include evaluation and demonstration of the solution and applicability to use case(s).

  * How unique is solution?  What is the value proposition, how has the technology been used and validated, and are there potential benefits or tradeoffs?

  * What is the business model or financial plans?    


  Stage 2 will be judged on the following criteria:


  * All the criteria indicated in Stage 1

  * Cooling capacity – The solution must achieve a cooling temperature within 10% variance of difference between the dry and wet bulb temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (for both indoor and outdoor scenarios). Ability to sustain the reduced temperature for 95% of the time that the temperature remains at 35 degrees Celsius during a 6-hour test scenario.

  * Energy usage – Demonstrate 35-50% reduction in energy consumption compared to a traditional Air Conditioning (A/C) cooling baseline unit.

  * Water consumption – Demonstrate 25-50% reduced water consumption compared to a traditional A/C cooling baseline unit, as applicable.

  * Emissions – Produces zero greenhouse emissions during use.

  * Refrigerant – Does not contain ozone depleting cooling agents or hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).

  * Ease of Operation – Does not require a designed-in engineering solution; easily portable for reuse in a variety of environments; does not require specialized training; minimum operating instructions; plug-and-play; deployable within 10-minutes or less; ability to operate using a backup power source; no special storage requirements.

  * Affordability – Cost must not exceed 2x the cost of a comparable, traditional A/C cooling baseline unit.

# Judging Criteria

**JUDGING AND USE CASES:**  This Challenge is in two stages. Below are the judging criteria and “Use Cases” that provide context for Challenge and awarding of cash prizes.  

Submissions should explain how well the proposed solution(s) address the cooling problem and use cases based on the criteria below for both Stage 1 and Stage 2. Overall, the judging will consider how user-friendly (easy-to-install or retro-fit and easy-to-use) and cost effective the solution is, and how well it meets the judging criteria. 

Stage 1 Finalists will be based on how well the proposed solution(s) addresses the cooling problem and Use Cases including:

* How well does the submission address the problem and criteria?  This can include evaluation and demonstration of the solution and applicability to use case(s).
* How unique is solution?  What is the value proposition, how has the technology been used and validated, and are there potential benefits or tradeoffs?
* What is the business model or financial plans?    

Stage 2 will be judged on the following criteria:

* All the criteria indicated in Stage 1
* Cooling capacity – The solution must achieve a cooling temperature within 10% variance of difference between the dry and wet bulb temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (for both indoor and outdoor scenarios). Ability to sustain the reduced temperature for 95% of the time that the temperature remains at 35 degrees Celsius during a 6-hour test scenario.
* Energy usage – Demonstrate 35-50% reduction in energy consumption compared to a traditional Air Conditioning (A/C) cooling baseline unit.
* Water consumption – Demonstrate 25-50% reduced water consumption compared to a traditional A/C cooling baseline unit, as applicable.
* Emissions – Produces zero greenhouse emissions during use.
* Refrigerant – Does not contain ozone depleting cooling agents or hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).
* Ease of Operation – Does not require a designed-in engineering solution; easily portable for reuse in a variety of environments; does not require specialized training; minimum operating instructions; plug-and-play; deployable within 10-minutes or less; ability to operate using a backup power source; no special storage requirements.
* Affordability – Cost must not exceed 2x the cost of a comparable, traditional A/C cooling baseline unit.
* No FDA compliance / medical technologies.
* Applicability to Use Case(s).

**Use Cases:** Submissions should indicate and address at least one of the Use Cases:

*Use Case 1: Assisting First Responders*

* Applicable to both first responder personal use and using on survivors at risk of heat-related stress.

*Use Case 2: Personal Use*

* Applicable to individual use in indoor/outdoor environments.

*Use Case 3: Household, group quarter or multi-person use as an alternative to conventional Air Conditioning or built-in cooling solutions:*

* Many currently available home-cooling technologies consume large amounts of power.  That energy use makes these technologies not only expensive but also unavailable during a sustained power outage.

*Use Case 4: Indoor/outdoor venues accessible to homeless or displaced populations in public settings*

* For example, public cooling areas on streets, in schools, stadiums, subway and bus stations, or other solutions for individuals that do not have access to cooling.

**Judging Panel:**

A judging panel will consist of DHS, and other Federal partner representatives.  The judging panel could include State and local, and non-governmental emergency response partners related to preparedness or response mission areas.
