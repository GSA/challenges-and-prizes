### Description

This NIWC Atlantic Tech Bridge Prize Challenge is seeking submissions for two topics: Multilevel Security, Assured Position Navigation and Timing (PNT). This prize challenge is being run under 10 USC § 2374a and is considered an independent effort.  However, the results of this prize challenge may result in an additional follow-on acquisition opportunity.

**Topic 1: Multilevel Security**

Multilevel Security (MLS) allows the sharing of sensitive information across security boundaries and multiple communities of interest. Having information of different security levels on the same computer systems poses a real threat.  It is not a straight-forward matter to isolate different information security levels, even though different users log in using different accounts, with different permissions and different access controls. Ideal solutions for MLS applications would simultaneously permits access by users with different security clearances and access levels while denying access for users who lack authorization.

**Topic 2: Assured Position Navigation and Timing (PNT)** 

Alternative strategy to provide Position Navigation and Timing (PNT) inputs in environments where input may not be available or not as reliable from the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) constellation. Any viable alternative must operate under conditions where radio frequency PNT signals are temporarily or permanently denied, degraded, or unreliable. Ability to overcome additional constraints of the operating environment (such as environments indoors, underground, or where radio frequency signals cannot be received) is also of value. Ideal solutions should be able to support diverse use cases in support of small, mobile systems, including dismounted Marines using an alternative PNT data input to locate and track oneself, and others (by feeding such input into a network). Use cases include, but are not limited to, individuals/units navigating within a building or across large geographic areas, and using alternative PNT data input to locate and track individuals, small unmanned surface, subsurface, or air vehicles.

**The Challenge will go through a two-stage judging process.** 

***Stage 1: Initial Submissions.*** Submissions will be judged by panel members with resident knowledge of the subject.  Judging panel members will evaluate each submission based on the criteria outlined in the judging criteria below.  Each topic will be evaluated separately and independently from one another.  The goal of Stage 1 for the evaluators is to select five (5) participants and one (1) alternate for each topic, to present oral presentations at the CDCA Defense Summit on Dec. 7-9, 2021.  In the event that one of the first five (5) participants selected for oral presentations cannot attend the CDCA Summit, the alternate’s representative will be contacted for interest in presenting an oral presentation. 

***Stage 2: Oral Presentations at the CDCA Summit.*** The top five (5) participants for each technology category will be invited to present, at their own cost, the technology topic associated with their initial submission.  Participants selected to give oral presentations will give two (2) presentations at the CDCA Summit on December 7-9, 2021.

* ***Presentation 1: Pitch Jam On Stage at CDCA Summit*** – Selected participants will give a live presentation, on-stage in the exhibit hall at the CDCA Defense Summit. The audience will be made up of both CDCA Conference attendees and Government representatives. This presentation should be high-level and is not to exceed 10 minutes. There will not be a question and answer period for this presentation. At the conclusion of this presentation, conference attendees will vote on a People’s Choice Best in Show winner for each topic. Each topic winner will be presented with a Best in Show award on the third day of the CDCA Summit, 9 December 2021.
* ***Presentation 2: Private Orals with the Government*** - The second presentation will be conducted privately with the Government evaluators and other government representatives interested in the exchange. Only the participants and Government representatives will be present for this presentation. The oral presentation should be limited to a not to exceed 30 minute period followed by approximately 20 minutes of questions and answers. Only the government evaluators will ask questions. At the conclusion of all oral presentations, the Government judging panel team will privately discuss the oral presentations to determine the Prize Challenge winner and a runner up. The Prize Challenge Winner for each topic will be announced on the third day of the CDCA Summit, 9 December 2021.  Each topic winner will be presented with a Prize of $7,500, and the runner up will receive an Honorable Mention.

Prizes will be distributed to the eligible winners via electronic funds transfer (EFT), within 90 business days of the announcement of the winner(s).  NIWC Atlantic will distribute the funds evenly to all team members. Eligibility to receive an award is based upon the participant’s adherence to all rules for this Challenge. Funding for this Challenge will come from both overhead and direct funding.

1. If the Prize Challenge winners have previously done business with the US Government and have a CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code, the winner will be able to provide that information to the contest organizers.  The contest organizers will use it to complete the SF 1034, public voucher other than personnel.   The winner will then submit the completed voucher to vendor pay.  Vendor pay would then certify the payment.
2. If the winners do not already have a CAGE code, they need go to the System for Award Management (SAM) URL https://www.sam.gov/SAM/ to create an account and register their business.  Once they have the CAGE code, they would give the CAGE code to the contest organizers, who would use it to complete the SF 1034.

### Prizes

**Total Prizes:** $15,000 in cash and concessions valued at $30,000

NIWC Atlantic anticipates that two (2) prizes across two (2) challenge topics will be provided at one per topic each with a value of $7,500 payable to the Participant (Company, Academic Institution, or Team Lead for submission). Participants that are selected to participate in Stage II, will be invited to present an oral presentation at the Charleston Defense Contractors Association (CDCA) Summit in front of a Government judging panel. The cost of participating in Stage II (e.g., travel, hotel, etc.) will not be reimbursed by the Government and is the sole responsibility of the Participant. Additionally, selected participants will be provided two (2) complimentary Summit Exhibit Hall Passes to the 2021 CDCA Defense Summit provided by the CDCA with a value of $500 per company.  In addition, companies selected to present at the CDCA summit will receive from Advanced Technology International (ATI) a credit for membership in up to five (5) 10 USC § 2371b consortia’s managed by Advanced Technology International (ATI) with a value of approximately $2,500 per company.  Participants are encouraged to visit the CDCA website (https://www.charlestondca.org/14th-annual-cdca-defense-summit) for more Summit details and additional information on obtaining full Summit access.
