description: "<p>The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB)
  Design by Biomedical Undergraduate Teams (DEBUT) Challenge is open to teams of undergraduate
  students working on projects that develop innovative solutions to unmet health and
  clinical problems. NIBIB&rsquo;s mission is to improve health by leading the development
  and accelerating the application of biomedical technologies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The
  goals of the DEBUT Challenge are 1) to provide undergraduate students valuable experiences
  such as working in teams, identifying unmet clinical needs, and designing, building
  and debugging solutions for such open-ended problems; 2) to generate novel, innovative
  tools to improve healthcare, consistent with NIBIB&rsquo;s purpose to support research,
  training, the dissemination of health information, and other programs with respect
  to biomedical imaging and engineering and associated technologies and modalities
  with biomedical applications; and 3) to highlight and acknowledge the contributions
  and accomplishments of undergraduate students.</p>\r\n<p>The NIBIB DEBUT Challenge
  solicits design projects that develop innovative solutions to unmet health and clinical
  problems. Areas of interest for the biomedical engineering projects include, but
  are not limited to: diagnostics, therapeutics, technologies for underserved populations
  and low resource settings, point-of-care systems, precision medicine, preventive
  medicine, technologies to aid individuals with disabilities and HIV/AIDS prevention
  and care. Student teams participating in capstone design projects are especially
  encouraged to enter the challenge.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To support and expand
  the DEBUT Challenge, the NIBIB has joined forces with VentureWell, a not-for-profit
  leader in funding, training, coaching and early investment that brings student innovations
  to market. This public-private partnership on DEBUT, allows student teams to compete
  for prizes offered by both NIBIB and VentureWell by submitting one application.</p>\r\n<p>Student
  teams entering the challenge will have the option to have their entries also considered
  for prizes offered by VentureWell. VentureWell prizes will be selected and awarded
  by VentureWell following a separate judging process. The rules for the VentureWell
  prizes and the additional submission components that are required to compete for
  them can be found at <a href=\"http://venturewell.org/students/debut/guidelines\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://venturewell.org/students/debut/guidelines</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Statutory
  Authority to Conduct the Challenge:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>The general purpose
  of NIBIB is the conduct and support of research, training, the dissemination of
  health information, and other programs with respect to biomedical imaging, biomedical
  engineering, and associated technologies and modalities with biomedical applications.
  NIBIB is conducting this challenge under the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully
  Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science (COMPETES) Reauthorization
  Act of 2010, 15 U.S.C. 3719. In line with these authorities, by challenging undergraduate
  students to identify unmet clinical needs and develop innovative solutions for them,
  NIBIB targets the education of biomedical engineers who have the background, skills,
  and confidence to make outstanding contributions to biomedical technologies.&nbsp;
  Engaging undergraduate students to work in teams to design, build and debug solutions
  to real-world problems/needs in healthcare, not only prepares them to function effectively
  in their future work environment, but also yields novel, innovative biomedical tools
  that can transform healthcare.&nbsp;</p>"
