    <p>Measuring <span class="il">arsenic</span> in the environment and in drinking water is important for protecting human health. Drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities are subject to <span class="il">arsenic</span> regulations in order to limit human exposure and environmental contamination. While current analytical methods are suitable for ensuring regulatory compliance, there is a need for rapid, low-cost monitoring of <span class="il">arsenic</span> that would benefit water treatment plant operations, wastewater monitoring, contaminated site remediation, private well owners, scientific research and other interested parties.</p>
