description: <p>The goal of this challenge is to develop a job-matching tool
  that will be piloted in a <a
  href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/vets/programs/tap" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">Transition Assistance Program (TAP)</a> Employment Workshop at
  selected base locations. If the tool is effective, it could be added to the
  Employment Workshop curriculum for all transitioning service members.</p>
  <p>In 2018, the Department of Labor (DOL), the Department of Defense (DOD),
  and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) began a cross-agency effort to
  understand the transition of a Service member from active duty to civilian
  employment, from the perspective of the individual navigating this process—not
  the perspective of the Federal organizations that exist to support a plethora
  of programs. <a href="https://www.performance.gov/mapping-cx-journey/"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">The agencies built a journeymap of this process
  and found a recurring theme:&nbsp; navigating the “sea of support” and
  resources relating to the job search can be a challenging task.</a></p>

  alt="Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Labor, Department of
  Defense seals"></p> <p>Veterans complete their military service with unique
  and technical skillsets that bring value to all sectors of the economy, but
  can encounter challenges framing their experience and skills for civilian
  employers. American businesses report that they are also missing an
  opportunity to attract and retain a capable, competent workforce, and
  recognize the value in veterans and spouses.</p> <p>Many job boards, veteran
  hiring programs, and other initiatives exist, but there are disparate
  platforms of valuable data. Traversing across these resources can be
  overwhelming for both first-time job-seeking veterans and businesses with
  limited time to fill urgent needs. Additionally, most job search tools for
  Service members are based purely on military occupational specialties, which
  do not accurately represent the breadth of experiences many individuals have.
  Finally, small businesses in particular do not have the staff capacity to
  build out robust skills profiles that better describe hiring needs.</p>
  <p>There is a need for both a more sophisticated matching mechanism and a
  simpler interface that can pull from existing data sources (from Federal
  platforms like <a href="https://www.onetonline.org/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">O*NET</a>, the <a
  href="https://www.militaryonesource.mil/military-life-cycle/separation-transition/employment-education/credentialing-your-military-experience"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Credentialing Opportunities On-Line (COOL)
  program</a>, and the <a href="https://veterans.usnlx.com/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">National Labor Exchange</a>, to LinkedIn profiles, resumes, or
  job descriptions that individuals and businesses have created).</p> <p>The
  Government wants to be mindful of not prescribing what the platform should
  look like or how it will work, but wanted to note some of what job-seekers and
  Federal employees have shared throughout the research process of designing
  this competition. In particular, the agencies heard a need for:</p> <ul> <li>A
  matching-oriented application for the job-searching process. A platform that
  could determine likeness of fit, reveal matches, and allow both the employers
  and job-seekers to opt-in and share more information with each other and
  potentially interact more (connecting with Veterans at the company, chatting,
  etc.).</li> <li>A platform that has functions like a “ZocDoc” for job
  searching. Employers can self-input information (like doctors input their
  location, office hours, and information about their practice), external
  reviews from users are included, and users can actually take an action (book
  an appointment) in one place.</li> <li>A one-stop-shop verification system of
  employers. Employers on the platform could be matched automatically with
  databases that note if they are Federal contractors, have earned a <a
  href="https://www.hirevets.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIRE Vets
  Medallion</a>, or display information to help form a profile indicating
  whether the employer is who it claims to be (e.g.,
  Google/Glassdoor/Yelp/Better Business Bureau/etc.).</li> </ul> <p>This
  competition is divided into phases that will enable Solvers to further engage
  users in their design process and gather feedback on working prototypes. The
  most important requirement of this competition is that the platform solves
  challenges faced by the actual users, understanding what’s most useful and
  helpful to them, rather than being tool-led.</p> <p>Here is some of what we
  heard about the gap that exists:</p> <h4>Job-Seeker Needs</h4> <ul>
  <li>Ability to filter opportunities that match skillsets based on personally
  important components such as benefits offered, location, and culture.</li>
  <li>Recommendations of opportunities outside occupational analysis, if
  necessary, to describe the skills and role in a familiar manner that Service
  members better understand.</li> <li>Confidence in individual privacy and data
  protections at the highest standard.</li> <li>Ability to “Turn on / Turn off”
  when you’re looking for opportunities.</li> <li>Ability to control what
  information is shared with employers of potentially “matched” opportunities
  (e.g., if you match with an opportunity, what level of information is shown to
  an employer to either contact you or learn more about you).</li> <li>Ability
  to take an action directly (such as API to apply for a job or contact an
  employer)—minimizing the need to update multiple platforms or re-enter data
  multiple times.</li> <li>Ability to connect with other veterans at a specific
  company.</li> <li>Ability to easily remove a particular profile and all
  related data from the platform.</li> </ul> <h4>Employer Needs</h4> <ul>
  <li>Present themselves—in particular, small business with limited HR
  capacities—through a profile that contains standardized information, as well
  as information about the organization.</li> <li>Post specific available
  opportunities in a manner that is designed to address service member and
  veteran-specific priorities, including:&nbsp; position descriptions, required
  skillsets, benefits, and work environment (e.g., support for Veterans,
  training, onboarding, mentorship opportunities). This could include options to
  connect a job-seeker directly to veterans currently employed at the
  company.</li> <li>Generate “match lists” of qualified candidates.</li>
  <li>Provide technology-enabled solutions to allow for direct outreach to
  candidates through mechanisms they regularly check (existing email accounts,
  text messages) rather than a separate message management system that requires
  additional login (only if candidates have set their profiles to allow for
  direct contact).</li> </ul> <h4>Federal Government Needs</h4> <ul> <li>Access
  to a feedback loop to learn more about matches made, types of users, most
  useful feature, and other raw data to inform Federal program efforts and
  ultimately track outcomes, including employment that is initiated beyond 180
  days, wage rates, and/or retention statistics.</li> <li>Ability to fold
  in/link to existing government data efforts when they reach maturity.</li>

  agents’ use of each winner’s name, likeness, photograph, voice, opinions,
  public summary, and/or hometown and state information for promotional purposes
  through any form of media, worldwide, without further permission, payment, or
  consideration. </p> <p>Finally, the Government will continue to communicate
  the resulting winner’s solution only if it continues to deliver mutual benefit
  to the job seekers, employers, and Government in achieving its mission to
  provide relevant services to these populations. In order to measure this and
  continue to improve programs and services, the Solver or Solver team must
  share platform use data with the Government.</p>

### Description

<p>The goal of this challenge is to develop a job-matching tool that will be piloted in a <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/vets/programs/tap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transition Assistance Program (TAP)</a> Employment Workshop at selected base locations. If the tool is effective, it could be added to the Employment Workshop curriculum for all transitioning service members.</p>
<p>In 2018, the Department of Labor (DOL), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) began a cross-agency effort to understand the transition of a Service member from active duty to civilian employment, from the perspective of the individual navigating this process—not the perspective of the Federal organizations that exist to support a plethora of programs. <a href="https://www.performance.gov/mapping-cx-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The agencies built a journeymap of this process and found a recurring theme: navigating the “sea of support” and resources relating to the job search can be a challenging task.</a></p>
<p><img style="width: 500px; float: right;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/Vets-Employment-Challenge-sealsV1.jpg" alt="Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Labor, Department of Defense seals"></p>
<p>Veterans complete their military service with unique and technical skillsets that bring value to all sectors of the economy, but can encounter challenges framing their experience and skills for civilian employers. American businesses report that they are also missing an opportunity to attract and retain a capable, competent workforce, and recognize the value in veterans and spouses.</p>
<p>Many job boards, veteran hiring programs, and other initiatives exist, but there are disparate platforms of valuable data. Traversing across these resources can be overwhelming for both first-time job-seeking veterans and businesses with limited time to fill urgent needs. Additionally, most job search tools for Service members are based purely on military occupational specialties, which do not accurately represent the breadth of experiences many individuals have. Finally, small businesses in particular do not have the staff capacity to build out robust skills profiles that better describe hiring needs.</p>
<p>There is a need for both a more sophisticated matching mechanism and a simpler interface that can pull from existing data sources (from Federal platforms like <a href="https://www.onetonline.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">O*NET</a>, the <a href="https://www.militaryonesource.mil/military-life-cycle/separation-transition/employment-education/credentialing-your-military-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Credentialing Opportunities On-Line (COOL) program</a>, and the <a href="https://veterans.usnlx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Labor Exchange</a>, to LinkedIn profiles, resumes, or job descriptions that individuals and businesses have created).</p>
<p>The Government wants to be mindful of not prescribing what the platform should look like or how it will work, but wanted to note some of what job-seekers and Federal employees have shared throughout the research process of designing this competition. In particular, the agencies heard a need for:</p>
<ul>
 <li>A matching-oriented application for the job-searching process. A platform that could determine likeness of fit, reveal matches, and allow both the employers and job-seekers to opt-in and share more information with each other and potentially interact more (connecting with Veterans at the company, chatting, etc.).</li>
<li>A platform that has functions like a “ZocDoc” for job searching. Employers can self-input information (like doctors input their location, office hours, and information about their practice), external reviews from users are included, and users can actually take an action (book an appointment) in one place.</li>
<li>A one-stop-shop verification system of employers. Employers on the platform could be matched automatically with databases that note if they are Federal contractors, have earned a <a href="https://www.hirevets.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIRE Vets Medallion</a>, or display information to help form a profile indicating whether the employer is who it claims to be (e.g., Google/Glassdoor/Yelp/Better Business Bureau/etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>This competition is divided into phases that will enable Solvers to further engage users in their design process and gather feedback on working prototypes. The most important requirement of this competition is that the platform solves challenges faced by the actual users, understanding what’s most useful and helpful to them, rather than being tool-led.</p>
<p>Here is some of what we heard about the gap that exists:</p>
<h4>Job-Seeker Needs</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to filter opportunities that match skillsets based on personally important components such as benefits offered, location, and culture.</li>
<li>Recommendations of opportunities outside occupational analysis, if necessary, to describe the skills and role in a familiar manner that Service members better understand.</li>
<li>Confidence in individual privacy and data protections at the highest standard.</li>
<li>Ability to “Turn on / Turn off” when you’re looking for opportunities.</li>
<li>Ability to control what information is shared with employers of potentially “matched” opportunities (e.g., if you match with an opportunity, what level of information is shown to an employer to either contact you or learn more about you).</li>
<li>Ability to take an action directly (such as API to apply for a job or contact an employer)—minimizing the need to update multiple platforms or re-enter data multiple times.</li>
<li>Ability to connect with other veterans at a specific company.</li>
<li>Ability to easily remove a particular profile and all related data from the platform.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Employer Needs</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Present themselves—in particular, small business with limited HR capacities—through a profile that contains standardized information, as well as information about the organization.</li> 
<li>Post specific available opportunities in a manner that is designed to address service member and veteran-specific priorities, including: position descriptions, required skillsets, benefits, and work environment (e.g., support for Veterans, training, onboarding, mentorship opportunities). This could include options to connect a job-seeker directly to veterans currently employed at the company.</li>
<li>Generate “match lists” of qualified candidates.</li>
<li>Provide technology-enabled solutions to allow for direct outreach to candidates through mechanisms they regularly check (existing email accounts, text messages) rather than a separate message management system that requires additional login (only if candidates have set their profiles to allow for direct contact).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Federal Government Needs</h4>
<ul>
<li>Access to a feedback loop to learn more about matches made, types of users, most useful feature, and other raw data to inform Federal program efforts and ultimately track outcomes, including employment that is initiated beyond 180 days, wage rates, and/or retention statistics.</li>
<li>Ability to fold in/link to existing government data efforts when they reach maturity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Description: </strong>The concept paper phase invites all eligible entities to submit a concept white paper outlining their technology, the potential impact for job seekers and employers, the innovative idea / concept behind how their platform could work and leverage existing efforts, and how this is informed by user needs they have identified. Each concept and wireframe will be reviewed by a tri-agency panel. Only the first two pages (inclusive of any visual representations or graphics) of the concept description document will be reviewed along with the wireframe sketch submission and its one page description, if any. During the Phase I review process, the concept paper and wireframe sketch will be redacted for both applicant and any specific organizational partner names referenced (versus broader categories of organizational partners) and reviewed by Federal evaluators screened to avoid conflicts of interest. Department of Labor (DOL) will provide additional criteria throughout the various phases to further define requirement expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Prize: </strong>Up to 10 applicants with the highest ranking white papers will advance to Phase II.</p>
