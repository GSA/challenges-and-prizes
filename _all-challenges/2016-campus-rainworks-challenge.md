rules: "<h3><strong><u>Eligibility</u>:</strong></h3>  To compete in the Campus
  RainWorks Challenge, each student team must be affiliated with a degree-granting
  public or private institution of higher education located in the U.S. and sponsored
  by a  faculty advisor. All team members must be enrolled in an undergraduate
  or graduate degree program at an eligible college or university as of August
  31, 2016.  <h3><strong><u>Submission Categories</u>:</strong></h3>  To encourage
  participating teams to assess the environmental, economic, and social benefits
  of green infrastructure at a range of spatial scales, EPA is accepting submissions
  in two design categories: a Demonstration Project category and a Master Plan
  category.  <h4><strong>Demonstration Project Category</strong></h4>  For submissions
  in the Demonstration Project category, EPA is seeking proof-of-concept level
  designs that examine how green infrastructure could be integrated into a particular
  site on the team’s campus to meet multiple environmental, educational, and economic
  objectives. Entries in this category should include detailed information on
  the design and performance of the proposed demonstration project, and should
  reflect extensive consultation with the facilities planning department to assess
  project feasibility.  <h4><strong>Master Plan Category</strong></h4>  For submissions
  in the Master Plan category, EPA is seeking conceptual designs that examine
  how green infrastructure could be integrated into a broad area of the team’s
  campus. Entries in this category should be coordinated with existing campus
  master plans and should describe how green infrastructure could be used to enhance
  the long-term sustainability of the campus.  <h4><strong>For Both Categories</strong></h4>
  \ This year’s competition asks student teams to incorporate climate resiliency
  considerations into their stormwater management designs. For both submission
  categories, teams should examine and describe the current and/or potential impacts
  of climate change on their college or university communities. Entries should
  qualitatively and/or quantitatively demonstrate how the predicted performance
  of the team’s proposed green infrastructure project can mitigate and build resiliency
  to those impacts while effectively managing stormwater runoff (e.g., manage
  localized flooding, prepare for drought, reduce or eliminate irrigation, reduce
  urban heat impacts, lower energy demands).  <h5><strong>Submission Requirements
  \ </strong></h5>  To compete in EPA’s Campus RainWorks Challenge, registered
  teams must submit the following which describe an innovative green infrastructure
  project for a location on their campus:  <ul>    <li>One (1) Project Narrative,</li>
  \   <li>Two (2) Design Boards, and</li>    <li>One (1) Letter of Support</li>
  \ </ul>  Submissions should provide information of sufficient quality to enable
  the judges to evaluate the design. Submissions should describe the overall project
  goals, project context within the campus or watershed, existing conditions along
  with the problem to be solved, proposed green infrastructure approaches, and
  expected outcomes.  <h5><strong>Project Narrative</strong></h5>  <ul>    <li>The
  intent of the Project Narrative is to provide a summary of each team’s approach
  to addressing the challenge criteria (see Judging section).</li>    <li>Each
  team must prepare a Project Narrative not exceeding ten (10) 8.5” x 11” pages
  (including images, graphics, and tables; excluding cover page, abstract, and
  an additional allowance of two pages for calculations and references only).
  Note that pages in excess of ten will not be reviewed. Pages should be consecutively
  numbered with 1” margins, and text should be single-spaced in standard 12-point
  font. Headings may be larger than 12-point font; text labels for graphics or
  images may be smaller than 12-point font; page numbers may be outside of the
  1” margin.</li>    <li>The Project Narrative must include a cover page (including
  registration number, project title, first and last names and disciplines of
  team members, and name and discipline of faculty advisor) and a project abstract
  (250 word maximum).</li>    <li>Teams must provide 1 electronic copy of the
  Project Narrative in Adobe Acrobat® PDF format. Instructions on submitting deliverables
  are provided below.</li>  </ul>  <h5><strong>Two Design Boards</strong></h5>
  \ <ul>    <li>The intent of the Design Boards is to provide a visual explanation
  of the site context, design elements, and design performance.</li>    <li>The
  design boards must focus on visual elements and limit the amount of excess text.
  The design boards should supplement, not duplicate, graphics within the Project
  Narrative.</li>    <li>Each team must prepare two 24” x 36” design boards. Each
  board must include the team’s registration number (see Registration section)
  in the upper right hand corner.</li>    <li>The design boards must include a
  site plan. Additional elements might include cross sections, conceptual drawing(s),
  or graphics representing anticipated benefits.</li>    <li>Teams must provide
  electronic copies of each design board in Adobe Acrobat® PDF format. Instructions
  on submitting deliverables are provided below.</li>  </ul>  <h5><strong>Letter
  of support</strong></h5>  <ul>    <li>The intent of the letter of support is
  to demonstrate consultation with the college or university’s facilities planning
  department to develop a feasible design.</li>    <li>The letter of support does
  not count against the ten (10) page limit of the Project Narrative.</li>    <li>Each
  team must submit a letter from a member of the college or university’s facilities
  planning department demonstrating support for the proposed design. Letters of
  support are not to exceed two 8.5” by 11” pages. Note that pages in excess of
  two will not be reviewed.</li>    <li>The letter of support must be on appropriate
  letterhead, must be signed by a member of the facilities planning department,
  and must include the registration number and project title.</li>    <li>Letters
  of Support must be provided in Adobe Acrobat PDF format. Instructions on submitting
  project files are provided below.</li>  </ul>  For complete eligibility requirements
  and rules, please visit the Campus RainWorks Challenge website to read the competition

description: <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Water is pleased
  to announce the 5th annual Campus RainWorks Challenge for undergraduate and graduate
  students. EPA is inviting student teams to design an innovative green infrastructure
  project for a location on their campus. Student teams will collaborate with a faculty
  advisor to develop a project narrative and design boards describing the project.
  Winning teams will be awarded a student prize to be divided evenly among student
  team members, as well as a faculty prize to support green infrastructure research
  or training.   </p><p>  The Campus RainWorks Challenge is designed to engage students in
  reinventing our water infrastructure. In most developed areas, stormwater is drained
  through engineered collection systems and discharged into nearby waterbodies. This
  stormwater carries trash, bacteria, heavy metals, and other pollutants from the
  urban landscape, degrading water quality. Higher flows can also cause erosion and
  flooding in nearby streams, damaging habitat, property, and infrastructure. As our
  cities and towns grow, more of our streams, lakes, and bays will be at risk. At
  the same time, these cities and towns will demand even more clean water to meet
  household and industry needs.  </p><p>  Green infrastructure refers to systems and practices
  that use or mimic natural processes. While “gray” stormwater infrastructure is largely
  designed to convey stormwater away from the built environment, green infrastructure
  uses soils, vegetation, and rainwater harvesting to manage rainwater near to where
  it falls. By weaving natural processes into the built environment, green infrastructure
  can also provide many community benefits, including improving air quality, reducing
  urban heat island impacts, reducing energy consumption, enhancing wildlife habitat,
  and providing community amenities.  </p><p>  As communities develop and climate patterns
  shift, both urban stormwater impacts and urban water needs are expected to grow.
  Our nation and our planet need innovative planners, designers, engineers, and other
  professionals to create resilient and affordable solutions. The Campus RainWorks
  Challenge is designed to encourage college and university students to become part
  of these solutions.</p>
