description: <p>In 2014, nearly two million Americans aged 12 or older either abused or were dependent on opioid painkillers, and&nbsp;61% of drug overdose deaths involved either an opioid painkiller or heroin.&nbsp; Naloxone is an antidote for an opioid overdose, whether from prescription opioids or heroin.&nbsp; It is a prescription drug with few side effects that rapidly reverses the effects of opioid overdoses.&nbsp; Although most frequently used in emergency&nbsp;rooms and on ambulances,&nbsp;many states have recently&nbsp;taken steps to make it easier for&nbsp;people in the general public, including family and friends of drug users, to carry and administer naloxone.</p>
    <p>Despite&nbsp;the increasing availability of naloxone,&nbsp;people carrying naloxone&nbsp;are often&nbsp;unaware when&nbsp;an overdose occurs nearby.&nbsp; Currently, there are no mechanisms to alert carriers of naloxone to a person in need of the&nbsp;medication.&nbsp; This is where you come in!</p>
    <p>FDA is hosting the <strong>2016 FDA Naloxone App Competition</strong> to encourage computer scientists, public health advocates, clinical researchers and entrepreneurs to develop creative solutions to this problem. &nbsp;Specifically, we are looking for innovative ideas for a smartphone app that connects people experiencing an opioid overdose to nearby carriers of naloxone.&nbsp; We are most interested in concepts that are readily scalable, free or low-cost to the end-user, and take advantage of existing systems for naloxone distribution and use.</p>

prizes: <p><strong>First Prize:&nbsp; $40,000.00</strong></p>
    <p>The entrant with the highest score will be awarded a prize of $40,000.</p>
    <p>Won by:&nbsp; Pwrdby<br />Solution:&nbsp; OD Help<br />Description:&nbsp; OD Help&rsquo;s concept is a simple, easy-to-use mobile app designed to connect potential opioid overdose victims with a crowd-sourced network of naloxone carriers. OD Help can easily be tailored for use in rural or urban areas by expanding or contracting the radius within which naloxone carriers are sought. An additional innovative feature of OD Help is the optional interface with a breathing monitor to detect when a victim&rsquo;s breathing rate is dangerously low, a sign of an opioid overdose. Hence, if the victim is alone and unable to call for help, OD Help will detect the diminished breathing and alert a naloxone carrier of the potential overdose. Other features of OD Help include:&nbsp; only alerting people in one&rsquo;s support network and allowing naloxone carriers to disable alerts when they are unable to respond. The app also provides instructions on how to correctly diagnose an overdose and administer naloxone and helps contact emergency medical services when help is required.</p>

    <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
    <p>The 2016 FDA Naloxone App Competition (the competition), announced on Sept. 20, 2016 in the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/20/2016-22550/announcement-of-requirements-and-registration-for-the-2016-food-and-drug-administration-naloxone-app">Federal Register</a>, encourages computer programmers, public health advocates, clinical researchers, entrepreneurs, and innovators from all disciplines to create teams focused on the development of innovative strategies to combat the rising epidemic of opioid overdose.&nbsp; Specifically, the competition invites submissions for an app that increases the likelihood of timely naloxone administration by connecting opioid users experiencing an overdose with nearby naloxone carriers. FDA is most interested in concepts that are readily scalable, free or low-cost to the end-user, and take advantage of existing systems for naloxone distribution and use. FDA&rsquo;s expectation is that any app developed through the competition will be used only with FDA-approved naloxone products.</p>
    <p>As explained in the Federal Register Notice, announcing the competition, FDA is sponsoring the competition under section 105 of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-258). FDA will be provided with technical expertise by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). NIDA and SAMHSA will each provide one (1) judge with experience in relevant fields including drug use and misuse, clinical trial design, development of mobile medical applications, and public health. Additionally, NIDA and SAMHSA will provide information to competition entrants at the code-a-thon on key issues, including (1) patterns of opioid use and misuse, (2) characteristics of populations at risk of opioid overdose, and (3) data collection and evaluation considerations.</p>
    <p>The Federal Register Notice stated, &ldquo;To be eligible to win a prize under this Challenge, an entrant (individual or entity):&nbsp; Shall have registered and entered a submission on <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">http://www.Challenge.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">http://www.YouTube.com</a> under the rules promulgated by FDA.&rdquo; Additionally, the notice points entrants to these rules for additional details on required components of a submission, and the minimum requirements for the proposed app. Accordingly, this document sets forth the official rules, terms and conditions (rules) that apply to the 2016 FDA Naloxone App Competition. These rules and should be read carefully before submitting a proposal.</p>
    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
    <p>Registration for the competition will open Sept. 23, 2016 and will close Oct. 7, 2016. To register, visit <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">http://www.Challenge.gov</a>, search for the 2016 FDA Naloxone App Competition, and follow the instructions.&nbsp; FDA strongly encourages entrants to register as teams, though individual registrations will be accepted. Throughout the competition, all interested parties will have online access to background information regarding the opioid epidemic and the public health recommendations for the safe and appropriate use of naloxone.</p>
    <p>The competition will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will consist of a code-a-thon at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) campus in Silver Spring, Maryland, for registered entrants to develop concepts and initial prototypes for an app that alerts carriers of naloxone to a nearby opioid overdose. Entrants are encouraged, but not required, to participate in the code-a-thon. Entrants will receive an email confirming registration and participation in the code-a-thon, if applicable. The code-a-thon will occur on Oct. 19-20, 2016.&nbsp; The code-a-thon event space is limited to the first 50 individuals who indicate interest in on-site participation during the registration process. There will be a virtual component to the code-a-thon for the first 100 individuals who indicate interest in remote participation during the registration process. At the code-a-thon, federal agency subject matter experts will provide background information to entrants on topics including, but not limited to the opioid epidemic, public health, and mobile medical applications and medical device development. All code developed through the code-a-thon will be made open-source and publicly accessible on the GitHub platform, a web-based code repository.</p>
    <p>In Phase 2,&nbsp;all registered entrants will independently refine their concepts into a functional prototype, a video of which will be uploaded to YouTube (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/">http://www.YouTube.com</a>). The video URL will be submitted, accompanied by a short summary/description of the prototype as detailed below, on <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">http://www.Challenge.gov</a> by the submission deadline of Nov. 7, 2016.&nbsp; Entrants will be permitted to submit questions before and during the code-a-thon to FDA, NIDA, and SAMHSA subject matter experts with backgrounds in opioids, drug use, public health, and mobile medical devices.&nbsp; All entrants will have access to submitted questions and their answers, which will be publicly posted online.&nbsp; Submissions will be evaluated by a panel of judges appointed by FDA based on the criteria set forth in these rules.</p>
    <p>The winning submission will be awarded a prize of $40,000. The prize awarded under this competition will be paid by electronic funds transfer and may be subject to federal income taxes. FDA will comply with the Internal Revenue Service withholding and reporting requirements, where applicable.&nbsp; The total prize pool for the FDA Naloxone App Competition will be $40,000.&nbsp; FDA reserves the right to not award a prize if no submission is deemed worthy.&nbsp; FDA also reserves the right to suspend, postpone, terminate, cancel, or otherwise modify the competition, or any entrant&rsquo;s participation in the competition, at any time at the discretion of the agency.</p>
    <p>During all phases of app development, all entrants should consider strategies to minimize legal risk and maximize regulatory compliance, including for the developer and the end-user. To ensure adequate consideration of potential liability, privacy and regulatory concerns, FDA strongly encourages all entrants to obtain independent legal counsel.</p>
    <p>Entrants may not test or evaluate their app using real people, including opioid users and naloxone carriers, during the competition. Following the competition, entrants may consider seeking grant funding from the NIDA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, to further develop competition concepts through testing and evaluation.&nbsp; As with all other National Institutes of Health funding applications, NIDA staff will provide dedicated assistance and guidance about the NIH grant submission process, including submissions for the NIDA SBIR grants. The SBIR grant program is open to all small businesses (which may include competition entrants) that meet applicable eligibility requirements set forth in the SBIR funding opportunity announcement. More information is available at <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-16-302.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-16-302.html</a>. For competition entrants and projects that meet all applicable SBIR requirements, the NIDA SBIR program may provide the opportunity to further develop Competition concepts through field testing and evaluation.</p>

### Description


<p>In 2014, nearly two million Americans aged 12 or older either abused or were dependent on opioid painkillers, and&nbsp;61% of drug overdose deaths involved either an opioid painkiller or heroin.&nbsp; Naloxone is an antidote for an opioid overdose, whether from prescription opioids or heroin.&nbsp; It is a prescription drug with few side effects that rapidly reverses the effects of opioid overdoses.&nbsp; Although most frequently used in emergency&nbsp;rooms and on ambulances,&nbsp;many states have recently&nbsp;taken steps to make it easier for&nbsp;people in the general public, including family and friends of drug users, to carry and administer naloxone.</p>
<p>Despite&nbsp;the increasing availability of naloxone,&nbsp;people carrying naloxone&nbsp;are often&nbsp;unaware when&nbsp;an overdose occurs nearby.&nbsp; Currently, there are no mechanisms to alert carriers of naloxone to a person in need of the&nbsp;medication.&nbsp; This is where you come in!</p>
<p>FDA is hosting the <strong>2016 FDA Naloxone App Competition</strong> to encourage computer scientists, public health advocates, clinical researchers and entrepreneurs to develop creative solutions to this problem. &nbsp;Specifically, we are looking for innovative ideas for a smartphone app that connects people experiencing an opioid overdose to nearby carriers of naloxone.&nbsp; We are most interested in concepts that are readily scalable, free or low-cost to the end-user, and take advantage of existing systems for naloxone distribution and use.</p>

### Prizes


<p><strong>First Prize: $40,000.00</strong></p>
<p>The entrant with the highest score will be awarded a prize of $40,000.</p>
<p>Won by: Pwrdby<br />Solution: OD Help<br />Description: OD Help&rsquo;s concept is a simple, easy-to-use mobile app designed to connect potential opioid overdose victims with a crowd-sourced network of naloxone carriers. OD Help can easily be tailored for use in rural or urban areas by expanding or contracting the radius within which naloxone carriers are sought. An additional innovative feature of OD Help is the optional interface with a breathing monitor to detect when a victim&rsquo;s breathing rate is dangerously low, a sign of an opioid overdose. Hence, if the victim is alone and unable to call for help, OD Help will detect the diminished breathing and alert a naloxone carrier of the potential overdose. Other features of OD Help include: only alerting people in one&rsquo;s support network and allowing naloxone carriers to disable alerts when they are unable to respond. The app also provides instructions on how to correctly diagnose an overdose and administer naloxone and helps contact emergency medical services when help is required.</p>

### Rules 


<p>Official Rules, Terms and Conditions</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The 2016 FDA Naloxone App Competition (the competition), announced on Sept. 20, 2016 in the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/20/2016-22550/announcement-of-requirements-and-registration-for-the-2016-food-and-drug-administration-naloxone-app">Federal Register</a>, encourages computer programmers, public health advocates, clinical researchers, entrepreneurs, and innovators from all disciplines to create teams focused on the development of innovative strategies to combat the rising epidemic of opioid overdose.&nbsp; Specifically, the competition invites submissions for an app that increases the likelihood of timely naloxone administration by connecting opioid users experiencing an overdose with nearby naloxone carriers. FDA is most interested in concepts that are readily scalable, free or low-cost to the end-user, and take advantage of existing systems for naloxone distribution and use. FDA&rsquo;s expectation is that any app developed through the competition will be used only with FDA-approved naloxone products.</p>
<p>As explained in the Federal Register Notice, announcing the competition, FDA is sponsoring the competition under section 105 of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-258). FDA will be provided with technical expertise by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). NIDA and SAMHSA will each provide one (1) judge with experience in relevant fields including drug use and misuse, clinical trial design, development of mobile medical applications, and public health. Additionally, NIDA and SAMHSA will provide information to competition entrants at the code-a-thon on key issues, including (1) patterns of opioid use and misuse, (2) characteristics of populations at risk of opioid overdose, and (3) data collection and evaluation considerations.</p>
<p>The Federal Register Notice stated, &ldquo;To be eligible to win a prize under this Challenge, an entrant (individual or entity): Shall have registered and entered a submission on <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">http://www.Challenge.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">http://www.YouTube.com</a> under the rules promulgated by FDA.&rdquo; Additionally, the notice points entrants to these rules for additional details on required components of a submission, and the minimum requirements for the proposed app. Accordingly, this document sets forth the official rules, terms and conditions (rules) that apply to the 2016 FDA Naloxone App Competition. These rules and should be read carefully before submitting a proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Registration for the competition will open Sept. 23, 2016 and will close Oct. 7, 2016. To register, visit <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">http://www.Challenge.gov</a>, search for the 2016 FDA Naloxone App Competition, and follow the instructions.&nbsp; FDA strongly encourages entrants to register as teams, though individual registrations will be accepted. Throughout the competition, all interested parties will have online access to background information regarding the opioid epidemic and the public health recommendations for the safe and appropriate use of naloxone.</p>
<p>The competition will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will consist of a code-a-thon at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) campus in Silver Spring, Maryland, for registered entrants to develop concepts and initial prototypes for an app that alerts carriers of naloxone to a nearby opioid overdose. Entrants are encouraged, but not required, to participate in the code-a-thon. Entrants will receive an email confirming registration and participation in the code-a-thon, if applicable. The code-a-thon will occur on Oct. 19-20, 2016.&nbsp; The code-a-thon event space is limited to the first 50 individuals who indicate interest in on-site participation during the registration process. There will be a virtual component to the code-a-thon for the first 100 individuals who indicate interest in remote participation during the registration process. At the code-a-thon, federal agency subject matter experts will provide background information to entrants on topics including, but not limited to the opioid epidemic, public health, and mobile medical applications and medical device development. All code developed through the code-a-thon will be made open-source and publicly accessible on the GitHub platform, a web-based code repository.</p>
<p>In Phase 2,&nbsp;all registered entrants will independently refine their concepts into a functional prototype, a video of which will be uploaded to YouTube (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/">http://www.YouTube.com</a>). The video URL will be submitted, accompanied by a short summary/description of the prototype as detailed below, on <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">http://www.Challenge.gov</a> by the submission deadline of Nov. 7, 2016.&nbsp; Entrants will be permitted to submit questions before and during the code-a-thon to FDA, NIDA, and SAMHSA subject matter experts with backgrounds in opioids, drug use, public health, and mobile medical devices.&nbsp; All entrants will have access to submitted questions and their answers, which will be publicly posted online.&nbsp; Submissions will be evaluated by a panel of judges appointed by FDA based on the criteria set forth in these rules.</p>
<p>The winning submission will be awarded a prize of $40,000. The prize awarded under this competition will be paid by electronic funds transfer and may be subject to federal income taxes. FDA will comply with the Internal Revenue Service withholding and reporting requirements, where applicable.&nbsp; The total prize pool for the FDA Naloxone App Competition will be $40,000.&nbsp; FDA reserves the right to not award a prize if no submission is deemed worthy.&nbsp; FDA also reserves the right to suspend, postpone, terminate, cancel, or otherwise modify the competition, or any entrant&rsquo;s participation in the competition, at any time at the discretion of the agency.</p>
<p>During all phases of app development, all entrants should consider strategies to minimize legal risk and maximize regulatory compliance, including for the developer and the end-user. To ensure adequate consideration of potential liability, privacy and regulatory concerns, FDA strongly encourages all entrants to obtain independent legal counsel.</p>
<p>Entrants may not test or evaluate their app using real people, including opioid users and naloxone carriers, during the competition. Following the competition, entrants may consider seeking grant funding from the NIDA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, to further develop competition concepts through testing and evaluation.&nbsp; As with all other National Institutes of Health funding applications, NIDA staff will provide dedicated assistance and guidance about the NIH grant submission process, including submissions for the NIDA SBIR grants. The SBIR grant program is open to all small businesses (which may include competition entrants) that meet applicable eligibility requirements set forth in the SBIR funding opportunity announcement. More information is available at <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-16-302.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-16-302.html</a>. For competition entrants and projects that meet all applicable SBIR requirements, the NIDA SBIR program may provide the opportunity to further develop Competition concepts through field testing and evaluation.</p>
