winner-solution-description-0: "<p>From http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2014/14-156.html<br>The
  recipients were:</p> <p>David M. Rubenstein Prize ($150,000): Room to Read    <br>Room
  to Read, founded in 2001, believes that world change starts with educated children
  and that the best way to create long-term systemic change in the developing
  world is through literacy and gender equality in education. It focuses on literacy
  as the foundation of all other learning by developing reading skills and the
  habit of reading among primary-school children. To achieve this goal, Room to
  Read increases access to culturally relevant, age-appropriate reading materials;
  increases the effectiveness of instructors teaching literacy skills; and improves
  the existing school environment so that it is more conducive to learning. The
  organization also aims to equalize the educational experience for girls by supporting
  them in completing secondary school with the academic and life skills necessary
  to succeed in school and beyond. Room to Read’s service area is Africa and Southeast
  Asia.</p><p>The American Prize ($50,000): SMART<br>The third-grade reading
  level is widely recognized as a key indicator of a child’s future educational
  success. A student who cannot read on grade level by third grade is four times
  less likely to graduate by age 19 than a child who does read proficiently in
  third grade. In 1992, the Oregon Children’s Foundation created a program to
  address the growing number of elementary school children who were reading significantly
  below grade level. Start Making a Reader Today (SMART) now operates at more
  than 250 program sites throughout the U.S. and serves approximately 9,000 children
  each year.</p><p>The International Prize ($50,000): Mother Child Education
  Foundation<br>The Mother Child Education Foundation (AÇEV) was started in 1993
  and is the largest literacy organization in Turkey. Its mission is to empower
  the Turkish people through education and enable them to improve the quality
  of their lives. It operates a variety of projects designed to address family,
  adult and early childhood literacy. At the time of AÇEV’s founding, only one
  in 10 children received any form of preschool education before starting primary
  school, resulting in large deficits in readiness to learn. AÇEV developed the
  Mother Child Education Program (MOCEP) for low-income mothers and children without
  access to preschool education. However, early MOCEP trials revealed that not
  all participating mothers were literate and therefore many were unable to carry
  out the collaborative cognitive exercises with their children, pushing AÇEV
  into a complementary area of need, adult literacy.</p>"
