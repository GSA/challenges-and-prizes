judging-criteria-description-0: 'Stage 1 Finalist Selection Criteria    The judges
  will use the selection criteria to select up to five (5) Finalists from the
  pool of eligible entries in Stage 1, which will be submitted to the U.S. Department
  of Homeland Security (“DHS”) for final approval. Criteria for Stage 2 will be
  announced at a later date.    When evaluating Stage 1 entries, judges will assign
  each submission one to five points in each of the criteria categories below
  (for a total of up to 30 points):   • Originality. Presents a novel approach
  to the problem, and offers creative solutions and unique hypotheses.    • Impact.
  Has the potential to significantly advance current city-level practices and
  resources for identifying biothreat signals, and simultaneously complements
  existing resources.    • Feasibility. Demonstrates significant potential to
  rapidly detect patterns with a high degree of confidence, ideally within a day
  of exposure and no longer than ten days from exposure, and uses technically
  sound methods that are backed by credible supporting evidence.    • Sustainability.
  Makes use of freely available and/or low-cost data sources that are readily
  accessible to city-level operators and DHS on a consistent and long-term basis.    •
  Scalability. Has the ability or potential to expand to other geographic areas,
  or signals indicative of biothreat incidents or other scenarios of concern for
  homeland security.    • Team. Demonstrates an appropriate level of experience,
  commitment, and ability to move from concept to system design within the timeline
  of the Challenge.     If any potential Finalist is found to be ineligible, has
  not complied with these Official Rules, Terms & Conditions, or declines the
  applicable cash prize for any reason prior to award, such potential Finalist
  will be disqualified, and an alternate winner may be selected.  The selection
  criteria are to be applied in the sole discretion of DHS, the individual review

description: 'Biological threats (otherwise known as “biothreats”) are everyone’s
  concern. Whether you’re a private citizen, a city administrator, or government official,
  we all share a common interest in keeping our communities healthy and safe.    Biothreats
  occur when harmful <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/emerging-infectious-diseases-pathogens">pathogens</a>
  are either naturally or deliberately released, posing a risk to national security
  and public health. Some of these pathogens can be transmitted from person to person,
  from inhalation or ingestion; and from exposure to powders, liquids, or aerosols.
  Infections caused by biothreats can lead to respiratory distress, gastrointestinal
  issues, and animal and human deaths. Often, biothreats are hard to immediately identify,
  and their spread can be hard to contain. If and when a potential biothreat appears,
  every minute counts. Local and national officials must work together to assess the
  level of risk, develop an action plan, and intervene. Currently, there are a variety
  of systems and tools in place; however, these tools largely rely on health data
  to detect signals. With the increasing proliferation of new technologies and data
  sources, such as the wealth of open data generated by progressively “smarter” cities
  and the trends that can now be observed through the aggregation of individual sharing,
  we now have an unprecedented opportunity. By harnessing these new streams of information,
  we may be able to identify an emerging problem more quickly and confidently, so
  we can ultimately resolve it faster.    Are early signals hiding in data we already
  have?    How could we use this publicly-accessible data to help identify emerging
  biothreats, contain their spread, and save lives?    With the Hidden Signals Challenge,
  DHS calls upon data innovators from a wide variety of fields— from data science,
  to civic tech, to epidemiology— to develop concepts for novel uses of existing data
  that will identify signals and achieve timelier alerts for biothreats in our cities
  and communities. Successful concepts will explore connections between multiple readily
  accessible data sources, to develop real-time insights that can improve public safety
  responses to emerging biothreats. DHS intends for this work to be the first step
  in the design of a local and/or national-level system that could enable city-level
  operators to make critical and proactive decisions based on the most relevant and
  actionable insights. The Challenge focuses on large metropolitan areas such as New
  York, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Chicago, Boston, and Atlanta as the basis for
  a proof of concept, but is open to solutions that address all geographic locations.    <strong>Have

  Signals Challenge Newsletter</a></strong></em>    <strong><em>This is a multi-stage
  prize competition with a total cash prize pool of $300,000.</em></strong>    <strong>Stage
  1</strong>    Stage 1 seeks concepts for novel uses of existing data that will identify
  signals and achieve timelier alerts for biothreats in our cities and communities.
  Up to five (5) Finalists in the first stage of this prize competition will be selected
  by the judges according to official Challenge criteria and will each be awarded
  $20,000 in cash prizes.    <strong>Stage 2 </strong>    Finalists from Stage 1 will
  move forward to Stage 2, where they will further develop their concepts into detailed
  system designs, with guidance from expert mentors as they compete for additional
  cash prizes. At the end of Stage 2, Finalists will be required to submit these detailed
  system designs, which will describe how concepts from Stage 1 are to be implemented
  in practice..    <strong>Submission Requirements</strong>: To be eligible to win
  a prize under this Competition, the Solver shall have registered to participate
  in the contest under the process and Solver User Agreement identified on the contest’s
  official entry site, which may be accessed at www.hiddensignalschallenge.com (hereafter
  referenced simply as “Competition Website”).    The U.S. Department of Homeland
  Security (DHS) calls upon data innovators from a wide variety of fields— from data
  science, to civic tech, to epidemiology— to develop concepts for novel uses of existing
  data that will identify signals and achieve timelier alerts for biothreats in our
  cities and communities. Successful concepts will explore connections between multiple
