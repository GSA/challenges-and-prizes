description: "<h2>Additional Information</h2>  The NCA currently owns and operates
  an online burial site information tool called the Nationwide Gravesite Locator (NGL).
  NGL is a system that provides the burial locations of veterans and their family
  members in VA National Cemeteries, state veterans cemeteries, various other military
  and Department of Interior cemeteries, and for veterans buried in private cemeteries
  when the grave is marked with a government grave marker.    The Nationwide Gravesite
  Locator includes burial records from many sources. These sources provide varied
  data; some searches may contain less information than others. Information on veterans
  buried in private cemeteries was collected for the purpose of furnishing government
  grave markers. NGL is not meant to be interactive; people cannot leave notes, photos,
  comments, etc. on any of the results generated. It is meant purely as an information
  tool. NGL is available both for desktop and mobile devices.  <h2>What can you do?</h2>
  \ We are asking you to submit ideas to creatively address <em>one or more</em> of
  the following items:  <ul>    <li>Attracts visitors to the online memorial</li>
  \   <li>Engages visitors while at the online memorial</li>    <li>Retains visitors
  for long term online memorial engagement</li>    <li>Returns visitors to the online
  memorial on a habitual basis</li>    <li>Ensures proper decorum/appropriateness
  is upheld within the online memorial</li>    <li>Incorporates in-person interactive
  features</li>    <li>Integrates interactive features for those who can only engage
  remotely</li>  </ul>  The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) National Cemetery
  Administration (NCA) seeks to create an interactive digital experience that enables
  virtual memorialization of the millions of people interred at VA national cemeteries.
  This online memorial space will allow visitors to honor, cherish, share, and pay
  their respects and permit researchers, amateurs, students, and professionals to
  share information about Veterans.    The VA already has the core data and the future
  development plan to execute on this online memorial concept. We are seeking your
  <em>best idea </em>of website features or integrations that will make the interactive
  process <em>meaningful</em>, <em>engaging, and appropriate</em> for all future audiences.
  \   The ideas submitted in this challenge may be utilized in follow-on challenges
  that will execute on Topcoder.    &nbsp;"
