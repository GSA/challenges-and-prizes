  Naval Air Warfare Center Air Division (NAWCAD) AIRWorks, in collaboration with
  IMPAX (NAWCAD’s partnership intermediary for experimentation, technology
  demonstrations, and prototyping), intends to accelerate the identification and
  evaluation of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) capable of operating in austere
  deployed environments without ancillary support systems. AIRWorks is
  especially interested in systems that do not require dedicated launch or
  recovery equipment. NAWCAD will sponsor a multi-phase technology demonstration
  which will culminate in a live event between 30 November-18 December 2020 at
  Yuma Proving Ground, AZ. The live technology demonstration will allow
  Government observers to evaluate innovative expeditionary UAS and it will also
  satisfy merit-based competition requirements for possible follow-on Other
  Transaction (OT) prototyping and procurement awards.


  The challenge will be conducted in two phases. During Phase-1, applications will submit a white paper that describes their UAS, a UAS technology questionnaire, and a video clip that depicts their UAS in operation. White papers, technology questionnaires, and videos will be evaluated by a panel of Government judges according to technical maturity, payload and endurance capability, and the demonstrated capability of the UAS to operate in austere environments without ancillary support systems. The full list of Phase-1 evaluation criteria are included in the Call for White Papers which is posted on the application website: <http://impax.tech/mi2-tech-demo>.


  The applicants who score the highest during the Phase-1 white paper evaluation will be invited to a Phase-2 live technology demonstration at the Yuma Proving Ground, AZ between 30 November-18 December 2020.  In addition, each company which accepts the Phase-2 invitation will provide two experienced Government UAS operators with three weeks of UAS operator training at the company site prior to the live demonstration event. Each company that provides operator training and participates in the Phase-2 live event will receive a $65,000 stipend to cover the cost of the Government operator training and defray participation costs for the live demonstration.  


  UAS solutions which are demonstrated at the Phase-2 live event will be evaluated by a panel of Government judges using a standardized scoring rubric. The evaluation criteria will be provided to demonstrators with their Phase-2 invitation package. This technology demonstration will be used to evaluate the state-of-the-art in relevant technologies, inform future acquisition strategies, and satisfy merit-based competition for potential future Other Transaction (OT) awards for prototyping and procurement.   


  #### **Key Dates**


  * Applications for participation will be accepted beginning on 12 p.m. ET Friday, June 5 until 11:59 p.m. EDT on Friday, July 3.  

  * Invitations to participate in the Phase-2 live technology demonstration will be issued via e-mail no later than 11:59 p.m. EDT on Friday, August 7.  

  * Responses to the live demonstration invitations will be due no later than 11:59 p.m. EDT on Friday, August 14. 

  * The first and second alternates will be notified and will receive invitations to the live technology demonstration in the event that primary invitees decline invitations. Those applicants who are not invited to the Phase-2 live event will receive notification via email no later than 11:59 p.m. EDT on Friday, August 21.

  #### Non-monetary Prizes


  At the Government sponsor’s discretion, participants of this technology demonstration may receive an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) award (under 10 U.S. Code, Section 2371 or 2371b), an award of a procurement contract for experimental purposes (10 U. S. Code, Section 2373), or a combination of these authorities. In the case of an award under 10 U. S. Code, Section 2371b, a successful prototype project may result in the further award of a follow-on production agreement or contract without additional competition.  The Government sponsor may also choose to pursue a traditional Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based acquisition.

  Only U.S. citizens are eligible to participate. Only U.S. companies or companies with U.S.-based offices and U.S. -based UAS manufacturing are eligible to participate. Only UAV’s that have been designed in the U.S. by a U.S. owned entity may be demonstrated at the live technology demonstration.  Modification of a foreign designed UAV is unacceptable.

In the case of an award under any of the authorities mentioned significant quantities may be needed for field-testing.  The Government may make an award, even if all performance goals are not fully met. The Government reserves the right to make zero, one, or two awards following the technology demonstration.
