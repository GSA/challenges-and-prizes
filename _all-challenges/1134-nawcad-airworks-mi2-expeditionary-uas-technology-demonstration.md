  Naval Air Warfare Center Air Division (NAWCAD) AIRWorks, in collaboration with
  IMPAX (NAWCAD’s partnership intermediary for experimentation, technology
  demonstrations, and prototyping), intends to accelerate the identification and
  evaluation of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) capable of operating in austere
  deployed environments without ancillary support systems. AIRWorks is
  especially interested in systems that do not require dedicated launch or
  recovery equipment. 


  NAWCAD will sponsor a technology demonstration between November 30 - December 18, 2020 at the Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona to evaluate innovative expeditionary UAS. This technology demonstration will be used to evaluate the state-of-the-art in relevant technologies, inform future acquisition strategies, and satisfy merit-based competition requirements for potential Other Transaction (OT) awards for prototyping and procurement. Any awarded OTs have the potential to become a part of a future Program of Record estimated to be worth up to $1 billion.   


  The challenge will be conducted in two phases. During Phase-1, applications will submit a system performance summary that describes their UAS, a UAS technology questionnaire, and a video clip that depicts their UAS in operation. Performance summaries, technology questionnaires, and videos will be evaluated by a panel of government judges according to technical maturity, payload and endurance capability, and the demonstrated capability of the UAS to operate in austere environments without ancillary support systems.  The full list of Phase-1 evaluation criteria are included in the request for system performance summary, which is posted on the application website (<http://impax.tech/mi2-tech-demo>).


  Applicants who score the highest during the Phase-1 white paper evaluation will be invited to a Phase-2 live technology demonstration at the Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona between November 30 - December 2020.  


  UAS solutions which are demonstrated at the Phase-2 live event will be evaluated by a panel of government judges using a standardized scoring rubric. The evaluation criteria will be provided to demonstrators with their Phase-2 invitation package. This technology demonstration will be used to evaluate the state-of-the-art in relevant technologies, inform future acquisition strategies, and satisfy merit-based competition for potential future OT awards for prototyping and procurement.   


  #### Key Dates


  * Friday, June 19, 12 p.m. ET: Applications for participation will open.

  * Friday, July 24, 5 p.m. ET: Applications for participation will close.  

  * Friday, August 21: Invitations to participate in the Phase-2 live technology demonstration will be issued via e-mail no later than 11:59 PM ET on Friday, Aug. 21.  

  * Friday, August 28, 5 p.m. ET: Responses to the live demonstration invitations are due. The first and second alternates will be notified and will receive invitations to the live technology demonstration in the event that primary invitees decline invitations. Those applicants who are not invited to the Phase-2 live event will receive notification via email no later than 11:59 PM ET, Friday, Sept. 4.
prizes: At the government sponsor’s discretion, participants of this technology
  demonstration may receive an OT award under 10 U.S. Code, Section 2371b. Under
  10 U. S. Code, Section 2371b, a successful prototype project may result in the
  further award of a follow-on production agreement or contract without
  additional competition. It is noted that significant quantities may be needed
  for field testing. The government may make an award, even if all performance
  goals aren't fully met. The government reserves the right, in its sole
  discretion, to award zero, one, or multiple OTs following the technology
  demonstration.

  Complete rules, terms and conditions are available at:
  <http://impax.tech/mi2-tech-demo>.


  Only U.S. citizens are eligible to participate. All applicants shall be U.S.-based and U.S.-owned companies utilizing only U.S. manufacturing and repair facilities. Modification of a foreign designed UAS is unacceptable.  At the request of the government, all applicants will be required to demonstrate proof that all of these qualifications have been met. Any applicant who cannot demonstrate that it meets these qualifications will be removed from further consideration by the government.  


  #### Terms and Conditions


  Complete terms and conditions are available at: <http://impax.tech/mi2-tech-demo>.


  Applicants should address in their performance summary their willingness and ability to comply with 10 U.S. Code 2371b(d) requirements (small/non-traditional business participation, cost shares, etc.) should the government sponsor elect to negotiate a 2371b prototyping OT award.
