description: <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>New technologies, including wearable interfaces like heads up displays, smart watches, and biological monitors have the potential to increase first responder safety while enhancing performance. However, variability in current testing procedures/environments pose a challenge in assessing the effectiveness of emerging technologies. To assess the potential of new technologies and compare technologies against each other, NIST is crowdsourcing ideas that use virtual/immersive environments in conjunction with physical spaces to create accurate first responder scenarios and a repeatable test environment for technology evaluation.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Your job is to propose a physical environment, along with immersive virtual reality tools, to facilitate the future of first response in a controlled and repeatable way.</li>
    <li>Possible First Responder Scenarios, Metrics/ Data to be collected, and Technologies to be tested are included on the Resources Tab, provided by NIST.</li>
    <li>This is an ideation prize only and does not require the development of virtual or physical spaces, only proposals.</li>
    </ul>

A competitor is eligible to win both a judges' award and the popular choice award. a. All votes are subject to review. Any competitor using unfair methods to solicit votes will be automatically disqualified from the challenge b. Entries that are eligible for the Voting stage will become viewable to the public. Make sure that if your entry moves on to the Voting stage, that you're OK with anyone seeing it! Depending on the number of entries received, either all or a selected shortlist will move on to the Voting stage.</p>
