description: '<em>Challenge is closed. See press release below about the winner and
  how the code was used. </em>    <a href="https://www.nga.mil/MediaRoom/News/Pages/First-Challenge-gov-winner-announced.aspx">NGA
  press release August 17, 2016</a>    NGA is looking for an easy-to-use time slider
  or another simple mechanism to track a living story as edits change the story. 
  Most version control comparison systems are based on radio button and point selection. 
  We''d like to turn this behind-the-scenes function into a friendly front-page dynamic
  solution. Basically, we would like to see what you come up with for a dynamic, fast,
  and aesthetic way to easily track versioned changes within our existing construct
  for the "living document," in this case, a Wordpress post.    The Wordpress theme
  below was an attempt to move the version control behind the scenes to a vertical
  time slider. Red and green color codes show additions and deletions by bouncing
  around the page attempting to show where the content was added or modified.    The
  problem is page edits not currently within the browser active view cause vertical
  scrolls too quick for visual digestion.  How can we improve this?  The color codes
  highlighting additions and deletions move too fast. How can we slow this down?  Or
  do you have another original idea to solve this?    [embed]https://youtu.be/0mGwTJmvWl0[/embed]    <strong>Requirements</strong>    <em>Features</em>:
  The submitted WordPress theme or plugin must address these specific features:  <ul>    <li>An
  easy-to-use WordPress theme or plugin.</li>    <li>Ability to track living stories
  using a time slider. The edits will be coming in frequently, so the time slider
  will have to update in real time.</li>    <li>A friendly front-page solution that
  does not interfere with page loading or scrolling. This solution could be static,
  a panel which hides/fades, or something else altogether.</li>    <li>The solution
  should only appear in the browsers’ active view.</li>    <li>Transition effects
  from one time period to another should happen very smoothly.</li>    <li>Source
  code must be simple enough to understand and extend, yet robust enough to function
  as intended.</li>  </ul>  <em>Audience</em>: Your submission should be developed
  for end-users or readers who would like to easily view versioned changes within
  our existing construct for the "living document." The primary audience is NOT the
  developer but the general reader.    <em>Platforms</em>: Your submission must be
  a custom theme or plugin that functions without errors on WordPress, and seamlessly
  work on any type browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).    Development Standards:
  WordPress themes/plugins should be coded using the following WordPress <a class="jive-link-external-small"
  href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Theme_Development_Standards"
  rel="noreferrer">guidelines</a>.  <ul>    <li>Use well-structured, error-free PHP
  and valid HTML. See <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/"
  rel="noreferrer">WordPress Coding Standards</a>.</li>    <li>Use clean, valid CSS.
  See <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/css/"
  rel="noreferrer">CSS Coding Standards</a>.</li>    <li>Follow design guidelines
  in <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Site_Design_and_Layout"
  rel="noreferrer">Site Design and Layout</a>.</li>    <li>Follow coding recommendations
  in <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin#Plugin_Development_Suggestions">Plugin
  Development Suggestions</a>.</li>  </ul>  <em>Supplementary Materials</em>: You
  must submit a white paper no more than three (3) pages to oss@nga.mil that explains
  the product in detail, including:  <ul>    <li>Name of the projects and all sub-modules
  and libraries</li>    <li>Short description of all the projects and all sub-modules
  and libraries</li>    <li>Instructions on how to install, configure, and to use
  the theme/plugin</li>    <li>Instruction on how to grab the latest code</li>    <li>List
  of authors as well as their contact info (email address, website, company name,
  etc.)</li>    <li>If it''s a fork of something else, describe the original source
  and why the fork was necessary</li>    <li><strong>Make sure your white paper highlights
  the repo it supports</strong></li>  </ul>  <em>Testing</em>: You must make your
  theme/plugin available at no charge to judges for evaluation during the judging
  period.'
