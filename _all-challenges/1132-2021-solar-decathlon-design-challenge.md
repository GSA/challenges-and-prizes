  The U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon is a collegiate competition that
  challenges student teams to design and build highly efficient and innovative
  buildings powered by renewable energy. The winning teams will be those that
  best blend architectural and engineering excellence with creativity, market
  potential, building efficiency, and smart energy production.


  The Solar Decathlon continues to “push the envelope” on the design of the high-performance, efficient, affordable, innovative buildings while leveraging opportunities to foster student innovation, STEM education, and workforce development opportunities.


  Collegiate teams that compete in the annual Design Challenge create residential or commercial building designs that will be evaluated on how well they meet the nation’s rapidly evolving demand for innovative, cost-effective, quick-to-build, high-quality, resilient, grid-interconnected, efficient buildings that respond to targeted community needs. Beyond the residential and commercial building types that have been previously offered, the program is excited to add Retail Buildings to the mix. Teams can start planning now for the Solar Decathlon 2021 Design Challenge.


  The [2021 Design Challenge](https://www.solardecathlon.gov/event/challenges-design.html){:target="_blank"} will add a new contest focused on the lifecycle impacts of buildings. Teams are encouraged to reduce waste, pollution, and embodied carbon in their designs. In addition, teams should consider how buildings can be reused or repurposed at end-of-life. Partnerships with building owners are also encouraged to develop zero-energy designs for real building projects across the country and around the world. 


  Details about the Design Challenge are available on the [Solar Decathlon website](https://www.solardecathlon.gov/2020/assets/pdfs/sd-design-challenge-rules.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 


  #### Key Dates:


  * **June 2020:** Design Challenge team application opens.

  * **July 2020:** Design Challenge Competition Rules are released. 

  * **October 20, 2020:** All Design Challenge participating teams must complete the team application.

  * **April 16-18, 2021:** Design Challenge Finalist teams complete their project submissions and compete with presentations to industry leaders. 2020 Build Challenge teams will also present to industry leaders and winners are announced for both Challenges.


  The Solar Decathlon partners with building industry sponsors that provide technical support for project teams, invaluable jury feedback, and once-in-a-lifetime networking and talent recruitment opportunities for student participants. See more on the Solar Decathlon Sponsor page.
prizes: Winning teams are recognized at an awards banquet with hand-crafted
  trophies, and winning project presentations are published on the Solar
  Decathlon website. The competition and winners are promoted through a variety
  of media outreach efforts, which provide participants and their collegiate
  institutions an opportunity for international exposure. Collegiate
  institutions that participate in the Solar Decathlon are recognized as leaders
  who are producing career-ready professionals with cutting-edge skills.
