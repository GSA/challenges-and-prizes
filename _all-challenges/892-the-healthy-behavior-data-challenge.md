description: <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) located within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announces the launch of the Healthy Behavior Data Challenge.</p>
    <p>The Healthy Behavior Data Challenge responds to the call for new ways to address the challenges and limitations of self-reported health surveillance information and tap into the potential of innovative data sources and alternative methodologies for public health surveillance.</p>
    <p>The Healthy Behavior Data (HBD) Challenge will support the development and implementation of prototypes to use these novel methodologies and data sources (e.g., wearable devices, mobile applications, and/or social media) to enhance traditional healthy behaviors surveillance systems in the areas of nutrition, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and/or sleep among the adult population aged 18 years and older in the US and US territories.</p>
    <p>The collection of health data through traditional surveillance modes including telephone and in-person interviewing, however, is becoming increasingly challenging and costly with declines in participation and changes in personal communications. In addition, the self-reported nature of responses particularly in the areas of nutrition, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and sleep has been a major limitation in these surveillance systems, since self-reported data are subject to under/over reporting and recall bias. Meanwhile, the advent of new technologies and data sources including wearable devices ( such as:&nbsp; smart watches, activity trackers, sleep monitors, etc.), mobile health applications on smartphones or tablets, and data from social media represents an opportunity to enhance the ability to monitor health-related information and potentially adjust for methodological limitations in traditional self-reported data.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Healthy Behavior Data (HBD) Challenge will be conducted concurrently with a similar challenge proposed by the Public Health Agency of Canada.&nbsp; This will enable the two countries to learn from their respective challenges and leverage information.&nbsp; We expect increased efficiency with a dual challenge.</p>
    <p>The Healthy Behavior Data Challenge participants will propose data sources and approaches for aggregating data from wearable devices, mobile applications and/or social media in the areas of nutrition, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and/or sleep. In Phase II (Prototype Implementation), a subset of submissions (up to 3) with promising concepts will be invited to test their proposed approaches for ongoing public health surveillance.</p>

    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Augmenting Mobile Data Sources for Public Health Surveillance The system was designed to simplify and improve the quality and quantity of health behavior data collection by aggregating personal wearable device and mobile health app data, augmented by user validation and supplemented with survey responses. The mobile app was designed to collect and validate data from wearable devices and mobile apps and to collect survey responses on healthy behaviors. The data collected include nutrition, sleep, physical activity and sedentary behaviors. The project included a series of short, just-in-time survey questions delivered via push notification to supplement mobile data sources.
