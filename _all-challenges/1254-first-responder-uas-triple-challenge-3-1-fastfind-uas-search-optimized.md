### Description

Join us for this exciting drone (aka unmanned aircraft system or UAS) prize competition using your ingenuity and hardware build expertise to create a concept for a drone prototype. The result of the First Responder UAS Triple Challenge 3.1 “FastFind” will support the public safety community and its stakeholders.

UAS provide many different mission capabilities for first responders however they are not without their limitations.  This challenge is looking at enabling law enforcement as well as other emergency services to search a heavily forested area for missing persons using a UAS. The goal of this challenge is for Contestants to design, build, and fly a complete UAS solution that helps a SAR team locate multiple missing persons in a thick forested area by improving image detection and enhancing navigation techniques to ‘close the distance’ more quickly.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division is hosting this 3-stage challenge, with prize awards **up to $260,000** for the top designs. There are no fees or qualifications needed to enter the first stage. The most outstanding Stage 1 conceptual designs will be eligible to participate in the remaining stages of the competition [see Official Rules](www.challenge.gov).

**You can make a difference!** Continue reading to learn about challenge stages and details. To enter Stage 1, submit your [entry](https://uastriplechallenge.com) by September 30, 2021. For entry as a Walk-on for Stage 2, submit your [entry](https://uastriplechallenge.com) by May 6, 2022. Entries can be submitted through the Contestant Portal on the Challenge website at <https://uastriplechallenge.com>.

#### Background

NIST PSCR established the Innovation Accelerator to spearhead the research that supports the development and deployment of the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN). PSCR’s Open Innovation team engages public safety entities, government, academia, and industry to identify innovation opportunities and foster technology advancements for public safety communications through prize competitions and challenges.

#### Operational Use Case

Imagine you are a member of a search and rescue (SAR) team looking for multiple lost hikers in a heavily forested area. A common tool that is used to search above treetops, and in large areas, is a UAS with an optical camera. Unfortunately, due to the heavy forest vegetation, traditional optical cameras are ineffective.  What sort of improvements could you make to this system (UAS & sensors) to entirely mitigate or remove the problem created by the foliage? For example, improvements to this UAS SAR system could take the form of thermal imaging sensors, acoustic sensors, air sampling sensors, etc. Additionally, the UAS autopilot could be programmed to fly more effective search patterns through data analytic methods or to move closer to a suspected missing person's location from sensor inputs. The UAS must have the ability to search for the lost hikers from as far away and as fast as possible. 

There are several UAS design features that need to be considered in support of public safety agencies.

* The system needs to be cost effective to fit a first responder’s budget.
* The UAS needs to be easily deployable to operate in degraded launch areas at any time, so the capability of the UAS to have VTOL is necessary. 
* The UAS should be compact since space in a first responder vehicle is often limited.
* When the UAS runs low on power and needs to land, the process to refuel or recharge the system should be simple to quickly resume flight.
* The UAS should be easily pilotable.
* The system should be able to search as fast as possible for all missing persons.
* The system should be able to identify missing persons from great distances.

#### UAS Design Specification

UAS entered for the FastFind Challenge will be subject to the requirements outlined in the table below.  

 ***INSERT TABLE HERE***

PSCR is aware that various organizations may be developing drones with these or similar capabilities; however, these drones typically cost more than what a local public safety department might be able to afford. Additionally, they may not be practical due to the difficulty of transporting large equipment and/or the need for specialized training to operate it, both of which can be difficult for city/state agencies with limited staff and resources. Therefore, PSCR is hosting this 3-stage challenge to design, develop, and demonstrate drones with extended flight time and other capabilities that support first responders to help advance the research and push the boundaries of UAS technology for public safety.

#### **Deliverables Due**

Participants will be asked to:

* Submit a concept paper using an online form, outlining the UAS knowledge, skills, capabilities and design approach for this challenge.
* Create or purchase hardware necessary to build a prototype and implement the design approach outlined within the concept paper.
* Produce a Test flight video demonstrating the UAS prototype capabilities and safety compliance.
* Participate in a Live Competition, conducting flights in Starkville MS June 20 – 22, 2022.
