prize-description-0: 'SBA will award one (1) prize of $250,000 under this announcement
  to a city or Native American Community that is selected as a winner.    PAYMENTS:
  Because the subject of this competition is not just the development of online
  tools to streamline the business startup process, but also the implementation
  and improvement of such tools, prizes will be disbursed in three payments. The
  first payment, equal to 60 percent of a winner’s total prize amount, will be
  disbursed once all initial requirements (i.e. taking the Startup in a Day pledge,
  etc.) have been met. The second payment, equal to 20 percent of a winner’s total
  prize amount, will be disbursed after a winner has presented a demonstration
  of its open source solution to SBA and Agency staff has deemed that solution
  satisfactory.  This demonstration must be presented within six (6) months of
  the date of the award unless otherwise specified by the SBA. The remaining 20
  percent of the total prize amount will be disbursed after a winner submits a
  written assessment that includes, but is not limited to, the outcomes and outputs
  of its Startup in a Day activities as measured by the metrics outlined in its
  proposal, a summary of any lessons learned and best practices, and suggestions
  for any improvements to the design or implementation of similar competitions
  in the future. Winners must base this assessment on a period of live operation
  of their Startup in a Day web tools that is at least six (6) months and no more
  than twelve (12) months in length.   ASSESSMENT: Regardless of the length of
  the period of operation on which they are based, the written assessment must
  be submitted to SBA no later than 15 months after a winner receives its first
  prize payment. The written assessments, or portions thereof, may be made public.
  Further guidance regarding the format and means of submission of these assessments
  will be provided to winners prior to their acceptance of prizes.  ACH and SAM:
  All prizes will be paid via the Automated Clearing House (ACH) and winners will
  be required to create an account in the System for Award Management (SAM) in
  order to receive their prizes.'

description: '<em>Note: This Competition is open only to the <strong>local governments
  of United States cities</strong> (referred to as municipalities and townships by
  the U.S. Census Bureau) or <strong>American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian
  communities, or their constituent agencies and subdivisions</strong>. See more details
  regarding eligibility rules for participating in the competition under "Rules."</em>    The
  SBA is seeking to support entrepreneurs who are navigating the requirements to start
  a business.  Currently many of these requirements are in multiple locations and
  a streamlined approach could help entrepreneurs startup more easily. The Startup
  in a Day Competition – Dream Big Model is designed to spur the development, implementation,
  and improvement of online tools that will let entrepreneurs learn about the business
  startup process in their area, including how to register and apply for all required
  local licenses and permits, in one day or less. This announcement, the Startup in
  a Day Competition – Dream Big Model, is specific for cities and Native American
  Communities that will develop an open source solution that may be freely adopted
  by localities across the United States. An “open source” solution is software that
  can be freely used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone<a
  href="https://www.challenge.gov/create-new-challenge/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>
  and complies with generally accepted criteria for distribution outlined by the Open
  Source Initiative (for this criteria, see http://opensource.org/docs/osd#fields-of-endeavor).    In
  order to maximize the success of this competition, SBA will work with the National
  League of Cities (NLC), an advocacy organization representing thousands of municipalities,
  to establish a formal mechanism by which all Startup in a Day competition winners
  will be able to collaborate and share best practices.    In conjunction with the
  Startup in a Day Competition, President Barack Obama is asking cities and Native
  American Communities across America to take a pledge to support entrepreneurs in
  their area by making it easier to start a business (for the text of this pledge,
  see sba.gov/startup). While it is not required to enter this Competition, all cities
  and Native American Communities are encouraged to take the pledge. As an additional
  encouragement, entries submitted by cities and Native American Communities that
  do take the pledge will receive five (5) bonus points during the evaluation process,
  as stipulated in Item 3: Part V below. Furthermore, all Startup in a Day Competition
  – Dream Big Model winners will be required to take the pledge prior to receiving
  their prizes.    <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/create-new-challenge/#_ftnref1"
