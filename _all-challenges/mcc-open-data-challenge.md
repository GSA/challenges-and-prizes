rules: '<h3>Background</h3>  MCC is committed to publicly sharing data generated
  in the design, implementation, and evaluation of its grant investments to achieve
  two important goals:  <ul>    <li>Transparency. To enable any stakeholder, researcher,
  or agency to understand the source data and analysis behind MCC evaluations
  for replicating, or challenging, reported results.</li>    <li>Policy relevant
  research for the public good.  Recognizing the value of data generated through
  MCC projects and investments, public access to MCC-financed data can stimulate
  a wide range of policy relevant research, maximizing the benefits of MCC’s investments
  in large-scale data collection efforts in developing countries.</li>  </ul>  To
  date, MCC has published data packages associated with more than 46 studies.
  All data and its associated documentation is available on the <a href="http://data.mcc.gov/evaluations/index.php/catalog">MCC
  Evaluation Catalog</a>.  <h3>What is the Open Data Challenge?</h3>  Using data
  available on the <a href="http://data.mcc.gov/evaluations/index.php/catalog">MCC
  Evaluation Catalog</a>, we are looking for papers of up to 7,000 words that
  provide analysis in any of the following categories:  <ul>    <li>Analysis that
  supports or challenges assumptions made in ex-ante economic rate of return estimates
  (all ERRs are available on the MCC public website <a href="https://www.mcc.gov/our-impact/err">here</a>)</li>    <li>Analysis
  that supports or challenges results of independent evaluations (all final evaluation
  reports are published on the <a href="https://data.mcc.gov/evaluations/index.php/catalog">MCC
  Evaluation Catalog</a>)</li>    <li>Deeper dive analysis beyond the analysis
  presented in independent evaluator reports</li>    <li>Policy relevant analysis,
  particularly on topics related to MCC priorities, such as gender and poverty-related
  analysis</li>  </ul>  For more information about how the Open Data Challenge
  started, <a href="https://www.mcc.gov/blog/entry/mccs-first-open-data-challenge-learning-beyond-the-independent-evaluations">read
  this blog post</a>.  <h3 id="odcdetails">Who is eligible?</h3>  We are looking
  for current domestic and international undergraduate, masters, and PhD students
  studying in international development, economics, public policy, or related
  programs to be the lead authors responsible for analysis and interpretation
  of results using data available on the <a href="http://data.mcc.gov/evaluations/index.php/catalog">MCC
  Evaluation Catalog</a>.    Students are encouraged to partner with professors
  or other professionals that may contribute to the technical rigor of the paper. Undergraduates
  are encouraged to submit a recommendation letter from a professor or other professional
  along with their abstract to strengthen their submissions.  <h3>Why should you
  participate?</h3>  The MCC Open Data Challenge promotes the use of MCC-financed
  data resources among current undergraduate, masters, and PhD students. As the
  next generation of practitioners, researchers, and policy makers, your thoughts
  and expertise on topics that matter can help inform MCC, and other development
  stakeholders, on what works and what doesn’t in development.    Up to six selected
  authors will have their submissions published in the <a href="http://data.mcc.gov/evaluations/index.php/catalog">MCC
  Evaluation Catalog</a> and will receive funding for travel and lodging to present
  at a research workshop at MCC’s Washington, D.C., headquarters. The selected
  authors will be invited to present their papers to an audience of senior MCC
  management, policy makers, researchers, and practitioners. This is an opportunity
  to have your work published and to share your analysis with a select group of
  decision-makers.    In addition, we are pleased to announce that a prizes of
  up to $1,000 will be available to a select number of submitters based on quality
  papers. MCC will determine who is eligible, and the amount of the prize. Receiving
  a prize does not ensure advancement in the competition.    While MCC requests
  authors’ permission to distribute the papers submitted to MCC for consideration
  in this Open Data Challenge, MCC strongly encourages authors to also submit
  their papers to peer-review journals for broader distribution.  <h3>How will
  papers be assessed?</h3>  MCC will form a panel of experts to review papers
  using criteria that will be made available on this website. All papers will
  be assessed for:  <ul>    <li>Technical rigor. Are appropriate statistical methods
  used? Are assumptions reasonable?</li>    <li>Expected contribution. Is the
  paper timely and likely to achieve influence with the target audience? Could
  this paper result in or support positive change? Does the paper have a novel
  presentation of an existing concept, or a synthesis for a new audience? Does
  the paper contribute to understanding/documenting international best practice
  in this area?</li>    <li>Clarity and presentation. Is the abstract/executive
  summary clear, complete, concise, and well framed for the target audience? Does
  the author clearly explain the objective of the paper? Do the length, content,
  structure, style, and presentation suit the target audience?</li>  </ul>  <h3>What
  is the timeline?</h3>  Please return to this page for submitting abstracts and
  papers by the respective deadlines. <em>Note new dates! The timeline has been
  extended to adjust to the academic calendar and encourage greater participation
  in the Challenge.</em>  <ul>    <li>By <strong>5:00 pm EST on October 17, 2016</strong>,
