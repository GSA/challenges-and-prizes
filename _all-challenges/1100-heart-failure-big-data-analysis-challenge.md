description: <p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of
  the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is inviting novel Solutions for the
  NHLBI Big Data Analysis Challenge:&nbsp; Creating New Paradigms for Heart
  Failure Research. The goal of the challenge is to foster innovation in
  computational analysis and machine learning approaches utilizing large-scale
  NHLBI-funded datasets to identify new paradigms in heart failure research. The
  challenge aims to address the need for new open source disease models that can
  define sub-categorizations of adult heart failure to serve as a springboard
  for new research hypotheses and tool development in areas of heart failure
  research from basic to clinical settings.</p> <p>Adult heart failure is a
  chronic, progressive disorder in which the heart is unable to efficiently pump
  blood, and more than 6.5 million Americans suffer from this condition. It is
  currently often categorized by a single metric – left ventricular ejection
  fraction – but is known to be a multi-organ, systemic syndrome with many
  related but seemingly disparate phenotypes. Additionally, social, behavioral,
  environmental, and genetic determinants often captured in study data have a
  considerable influence on outcome but are not well-understood. The field of
  heart failure research currently lacks a systematic framework that
  incorporates these many factors in a comprehensive disease model. An adult
  heart failure sub-phenotyping scheme incorporating many disease-associated
  factors would provide a new paradigm that will benefit investigations into the
  mechanism of disease, diagnosis, and, ultimately, prevention and
  treatment.</p> <p>The NHLBI seeks to foster such paradigm shifts in heart
  failure research by awarding innovative Solutions that utilize existing large
  health datasets. NHLBI has a history of making considerable investments in the
  creation of deep data resources including:&nbsp; long-standing,
  deeply-phenotyped <a
  href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/population-and-epidemiology-studies"
  target="_blank">epidemiological cohorts</a>, innovative <a
  href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/clinical-trials/nhlbi-clinical-trials"
  target="_blank">clinical trials</a>, and large-scale <a
  href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/precision-medicine-activities"
  target="_blank">precision medicine</a> efforts that have generated whole
  genome sequencing and “other omics” data for more than one-hundred thousand
  individuals. Many of these and other data are publicly accessible via the
  Database for Genotypes and Phenotypes (<a
  href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/" target="_blank">dbGaP</a>) and the
  Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center (<a
  href="https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/home/" target="_blank">BioLINCC</a>). The
  NHLBI Heart Failure Big Data Analysis Challenge webpage, <a
  href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/HFdatachallenge" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/HFdatachallenge</a>, provides further
  details about available open- and controlled-access NHLBI-funded datasets and
  data access resources.</p> <p>With these datasets in hand, the NHLBI is
  seeking to promote the application of computational analysis and machine
  learning approaches to create opportunities for hypothesis generation and
  research tool development for heart failure research. This challenge aims to
  reward innovative, computational Solutions utilizing large health datasets to
  develop a schema for the sub-phenotyping of adult heart failure that
  facilitates basic and/or clinical heart failure research objectives. A
  successful adult heart failure sub-phenotyping Solution will be a novel,
  pragmatic, accessible research tool for a spectrum of heart failure
  researchers. Successful Solutions will also be free and openly available to
  the research community. Participants are strongly encouraged to take advantage
  of NHLBI-funded datasets in the development of their Solution and are also
  welcome to bring other relevant data to their analyses.</p>
prizes: <p><strong>Prize Breakdown</strong></p> <p>Up to five (5) winners will
  be selected, with each winning up to $50,000.</p> <p><strong>Non-monetary
  Prizes</strong></p> <p>NHLBI will advertise the results of the competition and
  publicly display the winning Solutions. Winning participants may be invited to
  present their Solutions at an NHLBI-hosted scientific symposium.</p>
  <p><strong>Award Approving Official</strong></p> <p>The Award Approving
  Official will be Gary H. Gibbons, M.D., Director of the National Heart, Lung,
  and Blood Institute (NHLBI).</p> <p><strong>Payment of the Prize</strong></p>
  <p>Prizes awarded under this Challenge will be paid by electronic funds
  transfer and may be subject to Federal income taxes. If the Participants
  submit as a team, the prize will be awarded in one payment to the designated
  team leader. HHS/NIH will comply with the Internal Revenue Service withholding
  and reporting requirements, where applicable.</p> <p>NIH reserves the right,
  in its sole discretion, to (a) cancel, suspend, or modify the Challenge, or
  any part of it, for any reason, and/or (b) not award any prizes if no entries
  are deemed worthy. </p>

<p><strong>Registration Process</strong></p>
<p>Participants are invited to send an optional letter of intent to nhlbi_challenge@nhlbi.nih.gov briefly describing the anticipated approach for developing the Solution. Letters of intent should include a tentative title and a one-paragraph summary of the planned approaches. If a letter of intent is being submitted on behalf of a team or entity, it should identify the team leader. Limit 1 page.</p> 
<p>The optional letter of intent should be submitted to <a href="mailto:nhlbi_challenge@nhlbi.nih.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nhlbi_challenge@nhlbi.nih.gov</a> by NOON (12 p.m.) EST, July 28, 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Each Solution for this Challenge requires a complete “Solution Package.” If Participants submit as a team or as an entity, they should identify a team leader who will serve as a point of contact and submit the Solution Package on behalf of the team. Only complete and correctly formatted Solution Packages will be reviewed. The Solution Package includes a cover page and a written description of the Solution, including approach and utility. Detailed instructions on the content of the Solution Package are listed below.</p> 
<p>Submit the Solution Package as a single PDF file to <a href="mailto:nhlbi_challenge@nhlbi.nih.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nhlbi_challenge@nhlbi.nih.gov</a> by NOON (12 p.m.) EST, August 28, 2020.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Solution writeup must consist of a single PDF file with at least 1-inch margins. Font size must be no smaller than 11-point Arial. All Solutions must be in English.</li>
<li>On the Cover Page, include a project summary (abstract) that describes the Solution. Explain how the heart failure research community can benefit from the Solution and why the approach is innovative. Describe applicable expertise utilized in developing the Solution. Limit 1 page.</li>
<li>Describe clearly your Solution to the Challenge, including a concise title. Explain the methods used to meet the main requirements for the challenge. Cite appropriate references to support the work. Include figures/illustrations where appropriate (figures/illustrations will count towards the page limit). Limit 6 pages.</li>
<li>References will not count towards the page limit.</li>
<li>Participants cannot use the logo or official seal of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); the National Institutes of Health (NIH); or the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Participants cannot claim federal government endorsement of their Solutions.</li>
