description: '<p>UPDATE: Please upload
  all submissions through our new challenge site here: <a href="http://mtconnect-apps.devpost.com/">MTConnect-Apps.devpost.com</a></p>   <p>  The submission deadline for this
  competition has been EXTENDED to July 15, 2016. Winners will be announced by September
  17, 2016. Finalists will be invited to Chicago to attend <a href="http://www.imts.com/"
  target="_blank">IMTS-The International Manufacturing Technology Show</a>, one of
  the largest manufacturing trade shows in the world, taking place September 12-17,
  2016</p><p>Attention all college and university students! We are standing
  at the intersection of big data and industrial manufacturing, and we need <em>you</em> to
  help us maximize connected technologies to revolutionize the manufacturing industry.
  Although the Industrial Internet of Things has been around for some time now, right
  now there is a new wave of innovation in how these industrial machines communicate.
  Every piece on the factory floor is a potential source of valuable data that could
  be used to improve the entire manufacturing industry, from the products themselves
  to how work gets done.</p><p>So we’re asking you to develop super innovative and advanced
  manufacturing intelligence application solutions, which are both innovative and
  deployable, using data acquired through the MTConnect standard. MTConnect is an
  open, XML- and HTTP-based communications standard that acts as the enabler for the
  Internet of Things for manufacturing by fostering improved connectivity and interoperability
  between manufacturing equipment and devices. Within the challenge itself, there
  are two separate competitions, and you can choose to participate in one or both.</p><p>#1— Idea
  Creation: Read more about the Ideation Challenge <u><a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/mtconnectstudentideas/"
  target="_blank">here</a></u>.</p><p> #2— Applications: Using either an independent idea/solution,
  or your solution from the Ideation Challenge (should you chose to complete both
  challenges), you must create an innovative and effective application of your solution.
  Your submission must include a written summary of the application, a video of the
  application in action, and a thumbnail image.</p><p> Please see the Rules tab for a
  comprehensive run down of the challenge rules and requirements. For more information,
  check out the Discussion tab here and our <a href="http://www.mtconnect.org/resources"
  target="_blank">resources on MTConnect.org</a>. And, if you have any other questions,
  don’t hesitate to reach out on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/mtconnect">Facebook</a> or <a
