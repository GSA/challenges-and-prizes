  **\*\**Important Update:** 


  **\*\*\* Due to the overwhelming interest and submissions for the “Reducing Disparities in Breastfeeding Innovation Challenge,” we are delaying the announcement of Phase 1 winners until July 2021. \*\*\***


  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), Office on Women’s Health (OWH) is seeking innovative ways to increase breastfeeding initiation and/or continuation rates and decrease disparities among breastfeeding mothers in the United States through the HHS Reducing Disparities in Breastfeeding Innovation Challenge.


  #### Background/Issue


  The HHS Office on Women’s Health (OWH) is charged with providing expert advice and consultation to the Secretary on scientific, legal, ethical, and policy issues, and serving as a coordination point throughout HHS on issues affecting the health of women and girls. OWH establishes short and long-term goals within the Department for research, disease prevention and health promotion, service delivery, and education for public health and health care professionals surrounding women and girls’ health. OWH identifies needs and monitors activities within the Department that contribute to women and girls’ health and through leadership of the Coordinating Committee on Women’s Health. Additionally, OWH is responsible for facilitating the exchange of information through the National Women’s Health Information Center and promoting women and girls’ health programs and policies, all aimed at improving the health of women and girls.


  Breastfeeding is good for mothers and babies. Breast milk provides the necessary nutrition for infants, changing over time to meet infants’ changing nutritional needs. Breastfeeding can reduce the risk of short- and long-term illnesses and diseases in both mother and baby. The [American Academy of Pediatrics recommends](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/129/3/e827) “exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months with continued breastfeeding with complementary foods for one year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infant.” Research also suggests that [breastfeeding may reduce a mother's risk](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2752994) of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.  Furthermore, studies suggest that interventions focusing on the prevention of diabetes and hypertension through education about breastfeeding benefits may have a positive impact on mothers’ cardiovascular outcomes.  Despite the many benefits of breastfeeding, racial and ethnic disparities exist among women initiating and continuing breastfeeding.


  African American mothers have persistently had the lowest rate of breastfeeding initiation and duration.  The [2011 Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52682/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK52682.pdf) noted that breastfeeding rates for black infants are lower than for white infants at all measurement periods after controlling for family income and education level. 


  #### Purpose


  OWH is creating a national competition to identify effective, pre-existing programs that increase breastfeeding initiation and continuation rates and decrease disparities among breastfeeding mothers in the United States. The goal of this innovative competition is to demonstrate sustainability and the ability to replicate and/or expand a program that has proven outcomes to improve breastfeeding rates and reduce disparities.


  #### Subject and Scope of Prize Competition


  The program must demonstrate evidence-based interventions to target gaps in breastfeeding education, instruction, and/or support for breastfeeding mothers in the United States.  The program will be shared with the general public.


  The competition has three phases. All eligible submissions will be evaluated, and separate prizes may be awarded for each of the three phases.
