rules: "<h3>Stages</h3>\r\n<p>This Challenge consists of two stages:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Stage
  1</strong> is a Theoretical Challenge requiring submission of a white paper.
  Within the white paper, participants are asked to submit an idea along with
  detailed descriptions, drawings, illustrations, specifications, supporting data
  or literature, and any other things that would be needed to bring the idea to
  practice. Stage 1 may award up to five prizes from a total prize award pool
  of $75,000.</p>\r\n<p><strong>If Stage 1 produces winning concepts and Reclamation
  determines Stage 2 competition is beneficial, Reclamation will launch</strong>
  a subsequent Reduction-to-Practice (RTP) Challenge. Participants will be asked
  to present their technology and submit a working prototype that puts their idea
  into practice. Stage 2 is anticipated to have a larger prize purse than Stage
  1. In addition to the direct monetary award for Stage 2, Reclamation will invite
  industry, non-profit organizations, and venture capital representatives to the
  Stage 2 presentations and testing.&nbsp; Participating industry, non-profit
  organization, and venture capital representatives will have the ability to seek
  and secure potential business deals with Solvers.&nbsp; Reclamation will invite
  and encourage Stage 1 winning solvers to participate, but will also open Stage
  2 to the public for new submissions.</p>\r\n<p>This posting only launches the
  Stage 1 competition. If Stage 2 is implemented, it will be officially launched
  and announced with a separate Challenge.gov posting.</p>\r\n<p>Stage 1 is a
  Theoretical Challenge that requires only a written proposal to be submitted.
  The Seeker (Reclamation) has a total cash prize purse budget of $75,000 for
  Stage 1.&nbsp; The minimum full award amount is $15,000. The Seeker can allocate
  higher individual award amounts up to the prize purse of $75,000, as it deems
  appropriate. The Challenge award will be contingent upon results of critical
  analysis and evaluation by the Seeker and the judging panel appointed by the
  Seeker.&nbsp; A total of up to five awards can be made for the highest ranked
  submissions that meet or exceed the Solution Requirements.&nbsp; Meeting the
  Solution Requirements does not guarantee that the proposed solution will receive
  an award from the Seeker.&nbsp; Partial cash prizes may be considered for solutions
  that meet some, but not all, of the criteria.</p>\r\n<p>Submissions to this
  Challenge must be received by 11:59 PM (US Eastern Time) on (1/4/2019). Late
  submissions will not be considered.</p>\r\n<h3>Eligibility</h3>\r\n<p>If Stage
  2 is implemented, Solvers do not need to have participated in Stage 1 to be
  eligible to participate in Stage 2. Stage 1 participants are not required to
  participate in Stage 2.</p>\r\n<p>Solvers are not required to give up any of
  their intellectual property (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) rights to the Seeker or Seeker&rsquo;s
  Collaborators to be eligible to receive an award. Please note that any proposal
  submitted will not be treated as confidential information.&nbsp; Accordingly,
  Solvers should protect their proprietary rights in their solutions prior to
  submitting their written proposal for consideration in the Challenge (e.g. filing
  provisional or full patent applications on the solution described in the written
  proposal prior to submission). See the Challenge-Specific Agreement for full
  details.</p>\r\n<p>This Challenge is being conducted by the Seeker under the
  authority of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (15 U.S. Code
  &sect; 3719) as amended by the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of
  2017, which states that cash prize purse awards for this prize competition may
  only be given to an individual that is a citizen or permanent resident of the
  United States, or an entity that is incorporated in and whose primary place
  of business is in the United States, subject to verification by the Seeker before
  cash prize purses are awarded.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cash prize purse payments:</strong>
  Payments will be paid in full to the eligible registered individual, entity,
  or team selected as a winner.&nbsp; Please see Payment of Award to Winners in
  the Challenge-Specific Agreement.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Registering as a team:</strong>&nbsp;
  Teams must register to compete by having the Team Leader form a Team Project
  Room - visit the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933884\">InnoCentive
  website</a>&nbsp;for details.&nbsp; The Team Leader must be a U.S. citizen,
  permanent U.S. resident, or representative of a U.S. entity eligible to receive
  a cash prize. In the case of a team registration, the cash prize purse can be
  split and paid directly to eligible team members as directed by the registered
  eligible team leader. The Seeker will not make payment to team members that
  are not eligible under 15 USC 3719 to receive a cash prize.</p>\r\n<p>Team Project
  Room requests must be made no later than 1 week prior to the Challenge deadline.
  Once registered, click on &lsquo;Form a Team&rsquo; at the top of the Challenge
  page for further instructions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Participation by those not
  eligible for cash prizes:</strong> Submissions will be accepted from all Solvers
  regardless of whether they are U.S. citizens, U.S. permanent residents, or U.S.
  entities, and are eligible to receive non-cash prize awards, if any. Meritorious
  submissions from non-U.S. citizens, non-U.S. permanent residents, and non-U.S.
  entities may also be recognized in publications issued by Reclamation announcing
  the results of the competition, such as press releases.</p>\r\n<p>Full eligibility
  details and other restrictions are detailed in the Challenge-Specific Agreement.</p>"

description: "<h3>Abstract</h3>\r\n<p>Reservoir sedimentation has become a significant
  problem with the aging of water storage facilities. Sediment deposition in reservoirs
  limits the active life of reservoirs by reducing storage capacity for water supply
  or flood risk reduction. Sedimentation also impacts dam outlets, reservoir water
  intakes, water quality, recreation, upstream flood stage, and downstream habitat.</p>\r\n<p>Current
  sediment removal technologies do not provide efficient and/or affordable enough
  solutions to this problem. Hence, Reclamation and our collaborators seek new or
  improved techniques for reservoir sediment removal in a cost-effective manner that
  preserves and sustains the operational objectives of the reservoir.</p>\r\n<p><em>This
  Theoretical Challenge requires only a written proposal.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Challenge
  Orientation Video:</strong> Subject matter experts from Reclamation and U.S. Army
  Corps of Engineers discuss the need for improved reservoir sediment removal methods.
  A brief video describing this Challenge can be found <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v2o6tEIz-E&amp;feature=youtu.be\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Overview</h3>\r\n<p>Reservoir
  sedimentation has become a significant problem with the aging of water storage facilities.
  This problem is a big deal because there are 90,580 dams listed in the National
  Inventory of Dams and 3,381 of those are owned by the Federal government (USACE,
  2016). Sediment deposition in reservoirs limits the active life of reservoirs by
  reducing reservoir storage capacity for water supply or flood risk reduction. Sedimentation
  also impairs dam outlets, reservoir water intakes, water quality, and lake recreation,
  increases upstream ground water level and flood stage, and causes downstream degradation
  of habitat and erosion of infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p>Most reservoirs are older than
  50 years and many are older than 100 years. The sediment-design life (typically
  50 or 100 years) will be reached when the sediment level at the dam is higher than
  the outlet and the outlet is prone to plugging by sediment and debris. Conventional
  temporary dredging has been used to remove sediment from some reservoirs, but it
  can be very expensive.&nbsp; Periodic pressure flushing with a full reservoir is
  another method used, but only removes a small amount of sediment around the dam
  outlet. Drawdown flushing can be effective through low-level outlets, but sacrifices
  the much needed water stored in the reservoir.&nbsp; Conventional dredging and flushing
  methods have shortcomings that reduce their applicability to large reservoirs designed
  for multi-year water storage, with relatively larger volumes of sediment that require
  removal.</p>\r\n<p>This Challenge seeks new or improved techniques for reservoir
  sediment removal in a cost-effective manner that still preserves and sustains the
  operational objectives of reservoirs managed by the Bureau of Reclamation and the
  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In order to minimize future loss in reservoir storage
  capacity, the ideal solution would include effective, affordable, and environmentally
  acceptable methods of removing sediment that are implementable at Federal water
  storage facilities. Sediment removal includes the collection, transport, and delivery
  of sediment through or around a reservoir to the downstream river channel area.
  Off-stream beneficial uses of removed reservoir sediment are outside the scope of
  this prize competition. Solutions are needed for the removal of both fine sediment
  (clay &amp; silt) as well as coarse sediment (sand &amp; gravel).</p>\r\n<p>Solutions
  are needed to facilitate long-term reservoir sediment management focused on maintaining
  the remaining reservoir storage capacity, rather than trying to recover past decades
  of storage loss.</p>\r\n<h3>About the Collaborators</h3>\r\n<p>The U.S. Army Corps
  of Engineers, Federal Regulatory Commission, National Resources Conservation Service,
  and American Rivers are collaborating with Reclamation on various aspects of this
  Challenge such as design, technical review, judging, and promotion.</p>\r\n<p>The
  mission of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is to deliver vital public and military
  engineering services; partnering in peace and war to strengthen our Nation&rsquo;s
  security, energize the economy and reduce risks from disasters (<a href=\"http://www.usace.army.mil\">www.usace.army.mil</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The
  mission of the Federal Regulatory Commission (FERC) is to assist consumers in obtaining
  reliable, efficient and sustainable energy services at a reasonable cost through
  appropriate regulatory and market means.</p>\r\n<p>The mission of the National Resources
  Conservation Service (NRCS) is to provide resources to farmers and landowners to
  aid them with conservation. Ensuring productive lands in harmony with a healthy
  environment is our priority.</p>\r\n<p>The mission of the American Rivers is to
  protect healthy rivers, restore damaged rivers and conserve clean water for people
  and nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"
