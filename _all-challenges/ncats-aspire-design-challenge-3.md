  innovative solutions to the development machine learning algorithms that would

  utilize the data from Challenge 1 and Challenge 2 during the envisioned Reduction-to-Practice
  Challenge to provide proof-of-concept and design, synthesize, optimize and test
  novel compounds that are less likely to trigger addiction or are able to treat
  addiction/overdose. Optimized novel small-molecule leads would be tested for

description: "<h3><strong>SUMMARY OF NCATS ASPIRE DESIGN CHALLENGE 3</strong></h3>\r\n<h4><strong>Predictive
  Algorithms for Translational Innovation in Pain, Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose</strong></h4>\r\n<p><strong>Challenge
  3</strong> aims to address the need for open source, advanced machine learning algorithms
  that would facilitate the discovery of novel, efficacious and non-addictive analgesics
  and/or treatments for drug abuse. This challenge requires submission of only a detailed
  description of the design of the algorithms, not the final working versions. While
  initially the innovators can use their own training sets to demonstrate functionality
  of an algorithm, in the envisioned follow-on Reduction-to-Practice stage, the algorithm
  will be expected to incorporate and analyze data generated from Challenges 1, 2
  and 4.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Evaluation criteria that reviewers will be asked to address
  are specified under the \"Judging Criteria\" tab.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For complete details
  on the challenge,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ncats.nih.gov/aspire/challenges/challenge3\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">visit the NCATS ASPIRE Design Challenge 3 details
  page</a>.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>About NCATS ASPIRE Design Challenges</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The
  National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), part of the National
  Institutes of Health (NIH) is inviting novel design solutions for A Specialized
  Platform for Innovative Research Exploration (<strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong>) Challenges
  as part of the <strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong> Program. The goal of the <strong>NCATS
  ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges is to reward and spur innovative and catalytic
  approaches towards solving the opioid crisis through development of: (1) novel chemistries;
  (2) data-mining and analysis tools and technologies; and (3) biological assays that
  will revolutionize discovery, development and pre-clinical testing of next generation,
  safer and non-addictive analgesics to treat pain, as well as new treatments for
  opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose. The first phase of these prize competitions
  is implemented through a suite of concurrent companion design challenges that comprises
  a separate challenge for each of four areas: chemistry database, electronic laboratory
  knowledge portal for synthetic chemistry, algorithms, and biological assays; and
  an additional challenge for a combined solution to at least two Challenge areas.
  At this stage, innovators are expected to submit designs, not final products or
  prototypes.NCATS envisions following these design challenges with a follow-on, but
  distinct, final reduction-to-practice challenge, which will aim to invoke further
  scientific and technological development of the model system. Winners of the design
  challenges will be invited to present their designs so that, in the envisioned follow-up
  Reduction-to-Practice Challenge, an open competition, teams will be able to form
  multi-disciplinary collaborations to advance and integrate the most feasible and
  promising approaches to the multiple challenges into a single integrative platform.
  Innovators will be invited to demonstrate final solutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>NCATS
  ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges are part of the of the NIH&rsquo;s Helping to
  End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national
  opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative will bolster research across
  NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain
  management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at: &nbsp;<a
  href=\"https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative.\">https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative.</a></p>\r\n<p>NCATS
  refers to participants in the <strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges as
  &ldquo;innovators&rdquo; because all solutions will require highly innovative approaches
  to achieve success. &nbsp;Innovators should clearly state how and why the proposed
  solution would provide significant advances over currently available tools. Innovators
  may choose to compete in one or more individual challenges to address a single area
  (Challenges 1-4) or propose a combined solution for at least two Challenge areas
  (Challenge 5).<p>For further information send an
