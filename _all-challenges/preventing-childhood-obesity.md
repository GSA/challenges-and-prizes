description: "The Preventing Childhood Obesity Challenge will award $375,000 in prizes
  to support the creation of low-cost, scalable tech innovations to promote healthy
  weight for low-income children and families within the context of their communities.\r\n\r\nThe
  challenge is one component of a four-part Grand Challenge program coordinated by
  the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, part of the Health Resources & Services Administration.\r\n\r\nPotential
  areas of focus include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nPromoting access to healthy,
  affordable food;\r\nSupporting community-owned solutions that increase families'
  knowledge and skills related to healthy eating and nutrition;\r\nFinding innovative
  ways that increase physical activity, such as gamification, while accounting for
  environmental barriers to physical activity in underserved communities; and\r\nEmpowering
  families to achieve healthy eating practices, healthy lifestyles, and sustainable
  changes in the home environment, while accounting for limited access to healthy
  foods in under-resourced communities.\r\nSend any inquiries to MCHBGrandChallenges@hrsa.gov."
