  Technology 2016 in Salt Lake City, UT.    <strong>Project Criteria:</strong>    This
  challenge requires only a written research report in the format of a peer-reviewed
  scientific publication to be submitted. The submitted report should include
  the following:  <ul>  <ul>   <li>A clear and concise description of the technical
  approach (methods) used to solve one of the two Challenges listed in the challenge
  description.  <ul>   <li>  <ul>   <li>The approach should primarily be based
  on data analytic techniques (e.g. machine learning, Bayesian Neural Networks,
  etc.) using existing accessible data to derive new information in materials
  science and engineering.</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  </li>   <li>A discussion
  of how this approach and solution compares against the state of the art.  <ul>   <li>If
  the approach identifies a new material composition, material structure, or family
  of compositions, the solution will be evaluated against the degree to which
  the predicted and/or demonstrated range of properties provide significant improvement
  over currently known materials for a specific or variety of industrial applications.
  An analysis of the ability for or actual demonstration of practical synthesis
  of the material composition should be addressed in the report.</li>   <li>If
  the approach addresses modeling the linkage between at least two elements of
  material processing, structure, and/or property, a quantitative description
  of material structure (e.g. microstructure) must be included in the model. The
  solution will be evaluated against the degree to which the new physical insight
  solves longstanding gaps in our ability to accurately model material behavior
  across length and/or temporal scales.</li>   <li>For either Challenge, the report
  should address steps taken to validate the solution. The solution will be evaluated
  against the degree to which commonly accepted means of validation were used
  (e.g. complementary experimental testing, use of training versus validation
  data, etc.).</li>   <li>The new techniques and/or knowledge generated in this
  work will be evaluated for their likelihood to significantly advance the state-of-the-art
  in materials science and engineering or provide a path forward for a new industrial
  product.</li>  </ul>  </li>   <li>Citation(s) to the accessible data used in
  solving the Challenge and other relevant literature.</li>   <li><strong> </strong>All
  materials data used in the challenge must meet the following criteria:  <ul>   <li>Accessibility:
  data must be publically available via the internet. Solvers wishing to use their
  own materials data for analysis in this challenge must post the data in a data
  repository that is accessible.</li>   <li>Provenance: data sources used must
  have sufficient supporting information (metadata) to enable reuse by researchers
  outside the original research effort.</li>   <li>Discoverability: data must
  be discoverable and citable through a means such as a resolvable Uniform Resource
  Identifier (URI) or, ideally, a Persistent Identifier (PID).</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>   <li>The
  results of the approach must not have been previously publically presented nor
  published</li>  </ul>  The awards will be paid to the best submission(s) <strong>as

description: '<p>People have successfully applied advanced analysis techniques to ‘big
  data’ and have solved significant challenges in several areas of society including
  business, biology, and astronomy.</p> <p>Using these techniques has provided people with
  new and valuable information from the data that was not readily available by other
  means.  However, materials science and engineering data has not yet been exploited
  to its full potential because of its complexity.</p> <p>This complexity also stands to
  provide rich insights if the mysteries the data hold can be unraveled.    To advance
  the National goals of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI), we are soliciting innovative
  approaches to solve materials science and engineering problems primarily through
  the analysis of publicly accessible digital data. Areas of particular interest include
  discovery of new materials to meet an application need, or development of a new
  model describing processing-structure-property relationships in either a structural
  (load bearing), functional (electrical, optical or magnetic), or multifunctional
  material.</p>  <p>Emphasis will be on use of existing and accessible data sources, novelty
  of the approach, and validation of results.    Winners will be invited to present
  their work at a special session (reasonable expenses paid) during Materials Science
  &amp; Technology 2016 in Salt Lake City, Utah.    This challenge requires only a
  written research report in a format suitable for peer-reviewed scientific publication
  be submitted. The challenge award will be contingent upon evaluation of the proposal
  by the review committee.</p>  The Air Force Research Laboratory intends to make multiple
  awards with the top award being $25K and no award less than $5K depending on creativity
  and completeness of the report.    To receive an award, the Solvers will not have
  to transfer their exclusive IP rights to the US Government.  Instead, they will
  grant to the US Government <em>non-exclusive license </em>to practice their solutions.
  Other arrangements may be considered, if a license cannot be granted.    The US
  Government is soliciting advanced approaches to analysis of digital materials data
  that would provide new knowledge for materials science and engineering to a level
  where they would enable:  <ol>   <li>Discovery of new material structures and/or
  compositions that provide previously unattained and useful properties that enable
  new industrial applications or products.</li>   <li>Development of new models to
  link at least two elements in materials processing-structure-property relationships
  where those relationships are currently poorly described by physics-based models.</li>  </ol>  <p>Note:
  Solvers can be individuals or teams from academia, industry, or any other area.
  Solvers can submit reports for solutions to either or both of the needs described
  in 1 &amp; 2 above, but they should submit a separate report for each if responding
  to both. Reports must detail the source of the materials data, the research approaches
  used, and methods used to validate the findings.    We are not seeking submissions
  for the following areas: Research in biology for pharmaceutical, medical, or other
  biological or biomedical purposes.</p>    <strong>Background</strong><br>    <p>Reuse or repurposing
  of digital scientific data has been applied in many scientific disciplines to solve
  important technical challenges for that discipline. Advances in computational power
  and data science techniques have enabled these innovations by providing new means
  to extract information from large datasets. Materials science and engineering progress
  is dependent on understanding, connecting, and applying extraordinarily complex
  information across large temporal and spatial scales. However, researchers often
  times encounter hard limits on the availability of accurate physical models to describe
  behavior. This lack of well-developed physics-based approaches across scales hampers
  advances in the discovery of new materials and an ability to link processing-structure-property
  relationships in such a way as to enable quantitative and predictive materials design
  tools.</p> <p>The goal of the Materials Genome Initiative is to halve the time it takes
  to discover, develop and deploy a new material and at a fraction of the cost compared
  to traditional approaches. Application of data science techniques to accessible
  digital materials data to develop new knowledge is expected to be part of the solution
  to reaching this goal.    The goal of this project is to leverage advanced computational
  and data science techniques to solve challenges associated with discovery, development,
  and production of new materials. The US Government is soliciting innovative, detailed
  approaches that can solve barrier issues in materials science and engineering research
  and offer new avenues for providing rapid and insightful information in materials
  research and development.    Previously unpublished materials data may be submitted
  here (subject to NIST approval):    <a title="NIST data submission" href="https://materialsdata.nist.gov/">https://materialsdata.nist.gov/</a>    More
