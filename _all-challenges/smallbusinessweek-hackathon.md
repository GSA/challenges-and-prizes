      will be bound by the TOU and the Privacy Policy, which are hereby incorporated
      by reference in their entirety, as they exist now or hereafter are amended as
      if set forth herein. To the extent of any conflict among these Official Rules
      and the TOU or the Privacy Policy, then these Official Rules, the TOU, and the
      Privacy Policy, in that order of precedence, shall govern solely with respect
      to the creation and demonstration of Solutions in connection with participation
      in the Hackathon, for any other permitted use only the TOU and Privacy Policy
      shall apply. Any capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings
      set forth in the TOU or the Privacy Policy. Participants acknowledge that they
      have had an opportunity to access and review the TOU and Privacy Policy prior
      to agreeing to these Official Rules.    Subject to and conditioned upon Participant

      understand and agree that Visa may restrict the number of calls Participant
      Solutions make through Visa APIs, based on various factors including, but not
      limited to, concerns regarding stability or security of Visa APIs or other Visa
      systems. Visa may, in their sole discretion, change the method of access to
      the Visa at any time and may throttle, suspend, or permanently terminate responses
      to calls to their APIs.    U.S. Government APIs are subject to rules, terms,
      and conditions set forth by each individual Agency of the Federal, State, or
      Local Government.    Participants represent and warrant and agree that: (a)
      they will use the Challenge Materials only for purposes permitted by and in
      accordance with these Official Rules and applicable law and regulation and not
      for any commercial use, and any future commercial use of the Challenge Materials
      shall be subject to separate terms and conditions; and (b) they are solely responsible
      for (and neither Visa and SBA nor its affiliates have any responsibility to
      Participants or to any third party for): (1) any data, content, or resources
      that Participants obtain, transmit or display through their Solutions; and (2)
      any breach of Participant obligations under these Official Rules, any applicable
      third party license, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences
      of such breach. Participants further represent that their Solution does not
      infringe on the Intellectual Property Rights of Visa and SBA or any third party.    Any
      use of the Visa and SBA Materials shall include attribution to Visa and SBA
      as the source thereof and additionally shall contain all copyright and other
      proprietary notice or legends found on the original. For the purposes of these
      Official Rules, “Intellectual Property Rights” means (i) all rights under all
      classes or types of patents and applications thereof (including, without limitation,
      utility models, invention registrations, supplementary protection certificates,
      and all divisions, provisionals, continuations, continuations-in-part, extensions
      or re-examinations or reissues) and equivalent or similar rights anywhere in
      the world in inventions and discoveries in all countries of the world; (ii)
      trademarks (whether registered or unregistered), trademark applications, trade
      names, service marks (whether registered or unregistered), service mark applications,
      (iii) copyrights (whether registered or unregistered), copyright applications,
      mask work rights, moral rights, and other rights in works of authorship, (iv)
      and trade secrets to the extent protected by any federal or state law of the
      United States. Participants acknowledge and agree that authorized use of Visa
      and SBA Challenge Materials does not excuse them from, and Visa and SBA will
      not be responsible for, their compliance with applicable laws that may require
      them to be licensed as a money transmitter or chartered as a bank in the jurisdiction
      in which they are, may be, or will be offering services.</li>    <li><span style="text-decoration:
      underline;">Judging Criteria</span>: At the conclusion of the Hackathon, each
      team will have 3 minutes to demonstrate the Solution that Participants have
      developed for the panel of judges, followed by 2 minutes of Q&amp;A. Demonstration

      depending on the number of teams. Participants may choose how to present their
      Solution, but are encouraged to explain and demonstrate how their Solution meets
      the judging criteria. Participants acknowledge that the panel of judges may
      ask them questions regarding their Solution. The order of demonstrations will
      be decided by the judges in their discretion.Visa and SBA will award prizes

      is already on the market?  • 0 - 30 POINTS: Market Potential - Will this Solution
      have viable reach, and market potential for small business owners and entrepreneurs?  •
      0 - 20 POINTS: Technical Execution - How effectively are the available APIs
      used? Is your Solution viable and easy to navigate?  • 0 - 20 POINTS: Challenge
      Fit - Does this Solution effectively respond to the National Small Business
      Week Hackathon Challenge?    Decisions of Visa and SBA, their representatives,
      or individuals selected by Visa and SBA with respect to all aspects of the National
      Small Business Week Hackathon Challenge will be final and binding. Judges for
      this competition may be individuals from the public and/or private sector with
      subject matter expertise in the areas of entrepreneurship, banking, and/or information
      technology. Solutions developed and submitted in connection with the National
      Small Business Week Hackathon Challenge should not:    • Contain, depict, or
      refer (explicitly or otherwise) to any inappropriate, objectionable, or unsuitable
      language, activity or other content.  • Contain, depict or refer to any content

      prize recipient by e-mail (at the e-mail address provided by the Participant
      when registering for the Hackathon). In the event Visa or its agent is unable

      by the SBA and Visa’s sole discretion, such potential winner’s prize will be
      forfeited and an alternate winner may be chosen by the SBA and Visa.The e-mail
      notification will include a link that contains a copy of a Release and Eligibility

      Claim Form confirms compliance with these rules, acceptance of the prize as
      awarded, and release of certain parties from any losses, liabilities, damages
      or claims arising from or related to the prize awarded and the Challenge itself.
      If a potential winner fails to submit the Claim Form with all information required
      by the Submission Deadline, Visa and SBA reserve the right to disqualify the
      potential winner, and Visa and SBA shall be fully and completely released and
      discharged from any liability or responsibility in this regard.    Each potential
      winner must prove he or she is a qualified winner by providing identification
      acceptable to Visa or its agent (e.g., state driver’s license; state issued
      identification card; valid passport with address verification; or birth certificate
      with social security card and photo identification and address verification).
      If a potential winner cannot prove he or she is a qualified winner, the prize
      will not be awarded. If a potential winner declines the prize, another winner
      with the next highest score maybe selected based on the judging criteria.</li>    <li><span

description: The U.S. Small Business Administration and Visa invite you to bring your
  ideas and your laptop to spend a weekend solving real business challenges during
  the first ever National Small Business Week Hackathon in Washington, DC from April
  27 to 29. Small businesses are critical to local economies and communities throughout
  the United States. Their owners are passionate about their trades, but they often
  don’t have enough time for the day-to-day financial elements of running a small
  business. Help business owners focus more on their true passion by reimagining small
  business financial management. Make use of API's from Visa, the U.S. Government,
  and third parties to build a game changing new tool. A $24k prize pool will be awarded
  to winning submissions. Space is limited and registration is required.    <a href="https://www.sba.gov/national-small-business-week/events#section-header-1">Register
  today  </a>
