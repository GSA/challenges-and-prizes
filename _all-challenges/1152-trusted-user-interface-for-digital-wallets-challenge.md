description: "**About the Challenge:**  DHS is seeking a better designed user
  interface for digital wallets. DHS operations are using blockchain and
  distributed technologies to issue and verify credentials using open standards.
  These systems use credentials that may be issued by DHS and held in a digital
  wallet. DHS is looking for an easy-to-comprehend and useable interface that
  supports best practices for visual consistency, ensures security and privacy,
  is interoperable, and can be integrated with existing back-end processes. The
  user interface needs to instill confidence in the user of the digital wallet
  that their online interactions are secure and that the parties they are
  interacting with are legitimate. The desire is that this prize will foster
  better user interfaces for digital wallets through the community. This
  challenge will be a bake-off comparing user application interface solutions."

  #### Prizes: The challenge is in two stages. 



  **Stage 1:**  Three (3) finalists will each receive $5,000. This cash award will be based on whether user interface is easy-to-use, secure, private, visually consistent, and provides selective disclosures and consent for using a Digital Wallet. Stage 1 finalists will be publicly announced by S&T and also be invited to attend a virtual SVIP Community Engagement Event to present their work to the community.  


  The three selected Stage 1 finalists should continue to work with the W3C CCG membership to receive their feedback on their designs and the technical constraints that should be considered to further refine their work. The Stage 1 finalists will continue to the second stage of the challenge.


  **Stage 2:**  One (1) grand prize winner will receive an additional $10,000 at the conclusion of the challenge. This decision will be based on how well the user interface fulfills its functionality while integrating with Issuer and Verifier back-end processes.\

  Payment of the Prize:  Prizes awarded under this challenge will be paid by DHS S&T and must be received by the entrant via electronic funds transfer. All Federal, state, and local taxes are the sole responsibility of the winners. DHS S&T will comply with the Internal Revenue Service withholding and reporting requirements, where applicable.

  After the conclusion of the Challenge, DHS may, based on need and available funding, may negotiate one or more new agreements for the following purposes as authorized by law:


  * Follow-on prototype R&D contract, Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or Other Transactions Agreement as authorized by law and applicable DHS or DHS component policy.

  * Follow-on agreement for limited use of one or more designs in the DHS environment for test purposes for a minimum of up to one year; as authorized by applicable law and DHS or DHS component policy.
