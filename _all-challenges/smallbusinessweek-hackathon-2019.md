  will provide certain applied programming interfaces and other materials available
  for use in the Challenge, subject at all times to these Official Rules (the
  &ldquo;Visa Challenge Materials&rdquo;). SBA may separately provide materials
  (the &ldquo;SBA Challenge Materials&rdquo;). Participant use of any Visa Challenge
  Materials or SBA Challenge Materials (together, the &ldquo;Challenge Materials&rdquo;)
  made available to them on behalf of Visa or SBA in connection with the Challenge
  will be governed by these Official Rules.</p>\r\n<p>Visa may make certain Visa
  Challenge Materials available to Participants through a separate website known
  as the Visa Developer Portal. The Visa Developer Center Terms of Use (&ldquo;TOU&rdquo;)
  are available at <a href=\"https://developer.visa.com/terms\">https://developer.visa.com/terms</a>.
  These also include the Visa Developer Center Privacy Policy (&ldquo;Privacy
  Policy&rdquo;) (available at https://www.developer.visa.com/privacy). To the
  extent Participants obtain any Challenge Materials from the Visa Developer Portal,
  Participants will be bound by the TOU and the Privacy Policy, which are hereby
  incorporated by reference in their entirety, as they exist now or hereafter
  are amended as if set forth herein. To the extent of any conflict among these
  Official Rules and the TOU or the Privacy Policy, then these Official Rules,
  the TOU, and the Privacy Policy, in that order of precedence, shall govern solely
  with respect to the creation and demonstration of Solutions in connection with
  participation in the Challenge. For any other permitted use only the TOU and
  Privacy Policy shall apply. Any capitalized terms not defined herein shall have
  the meanings set forth in the TOU or the Privacy Policy. Participants acknowledge
  that they have had an opportunity to access and review the TOU and Privacy Policy
  prior to agreeing to these Official Rules.</p>\r\n<p>Subject to and conditioned
  upon Participant compliance with these Official Rules and compliance with the
  TOU, Visa grants to Participants a personal, limited, revocable, non-exclusive,
  non-transferable, non-sub licensable, royalty-free license to the Visa Materials
  in the United States solely during the Challenge and solely in connection with
  the creation and demonstration of a Solution for the Challenge.</p>\r\n<p>Participants
  understand and agree that Visa may restrict the number of calls Participants
  make through Visa APIs, based on various factors including, but not limited
  to, concerns regarding stability or security of Visa APIs or other Visa systems.
  Visa may, in their sole discretion, change the method of access to the Visa
  Developer Portal at any time and may throttle, suspend, or permanently terminate
  responses to calls to their APIs.</p>\r\n<p>U.S. Government APIs are subject
  to rules, terms, and conditions set forth by each individual Agency of the Federal,
  State, or Local Government.</p>\r\n<p>Participants represent and warrant and
  agree that: (a) they will use the Challenge Materials only for purposes permitted
  by and in accordance with these Official Rules and applicable law and regulation
  and not for any commercial use, and any future commercial use of the Challenge
  Materials shall be subject to separate terms and conditions; and (b) they are
  solely responsible for (and neither Visa and SBA nor its affiliates have any
  responsibility to Participants or to any third party for): (1) any data, content,
  or resources that Participants obtain, transmit or display through their Solutions;
  and (2) any breach of Participant obligations under these Official Rules, any
  applicable third party license, or any applicable law or regulation, and for
  the consequences of such breach. Participants further represent that their Solution
  does not infringe on the Intellectual Property Rights of Visa and SBA or any
  third party. Any use of the Visa and SBA Challenge Materials shall include attribution
  to Visa or SBA as the source thereof and additionally shall contain all copyright
  and other proprietary notice or legends found on the original of the Visa and
  SBA Challenge Materials. For the purposes of these Official Rules, &ldquo;Intellectual
  Property Rights&rdquo; means (i) all rights under all classes or types of patents
  and applications thereof (including, without limitation, utility models, invention
  registrations, supplementary protection certificates, and all divisions, provisionals,
  continuations, continuations-in-part, extensions or re-examinations or reissues)
  and equivalent or similar rights anywhere in the world in inventions and discoveries
  in all countries of the world; (ii) trademarks (whether registered or unregistered),
  trademark applications, trade names, service marks (whether registered or unregistered),
  service mark applications, (iii) copyrights (whether registered or unregistered),
  copyright applications, mask work rights, moral rights, and other rights in
  works of authorship, (iv) and trade secrets to the extent protected by any federal
  or state law of the United States. Participants acknowledge and agree that authorized
  use of Visa and SBA Challenge Materials does not excuse them from, and Visa
  and SBA will not be responsible for, their compliance with applicable laws that
  may require them to be licensed as a money transmitter or chartered as a bank
  in the jurisdiction in which they are, may be, or will be offering services.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4.
  Judging Criteria: </strong></p>\r\n<p>At the conclusion of the Challenge, each
  team will have 3 minutes to demonstrate the Solution that Participants have
  developed in front of the panel of judges, followed by 2 minutes of Q&amp;A.
  Demonstration time limits may be shortened or lengthened in Visa and SBA&rsquo;s
  sole discretion depending on the number of teams. Participants may choose how
  to present their Solution, but are encouraged to explain and demonstrate how
  their Solution meets the judging criteria. Participants acknowledge that the
  panel of judges may ask them questions regarding their Solution. The order of
  demonstrations will be decided by the judges in their discretion.</p>\r\n<p>Visa
  and SBA will award prizes (&ldquo;Visa and SBA Prize&rdquo;) to the Challenge
  teams that, in Visa and SBA&rsquo;s sole determination, best meet the following
  criteria:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>0 - 30 POINTS: Innovation - Is this Solution different
  and unique from what is already on the market?</li>\r\n<li>0 - 30 POINTS: Market
  Potential will this Solution have viable reach, and market potential for small
  business owners and entrepreneurs?</li>\r\n<li>0 - 20 POINTS: Technical Execution
  - How effectively are the available APIs used? Is your Solution viable and easy
  to navigate?</li>\r\n<li>0 - 20 POINTS: Challenge Fit - Does this Solution effectively
  respond to the Challenge?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Decisions of Visa and SBA, their
  representatives, or individuals selected by Visa and SBA with respect to all
  aspects of the Challenge will be final and binding. Judges for this competition
  may be individuals from the public and/or private sector with subject matter
  expertise in the areas of entrepreneurship, banking, and/or information technology.</p>\r\n<p>Solutions
  developed and submitted in connection with the Challenge should not:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Contain,
  depict, or refer (explicitly or otherwise) to any inappropriate, objectionable,
  or unsuitable language, activity or other content.</li>\r\n<li>Contain, depict
  or refer to any content that disparages or refers negatively to Visa and SBA,
  the Challenge, or any other person or entity.</li>\r\n<li>Contain any content
  that violates any law or any third party&rsquo;s Intellectual Property Rights
  (as defined below), privacy, personality or other rights.</li>\r\n<li>Collect
  any device or user tracking information like GPS location, device ID, etc. without
  explicit user approval, or store any non-public personal information on the
  device.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>5. Prizes for winners: </strong></p>\r\n<p>Prizes
  are awarded &ldquo;as is&rdquo; with no warranty or guarantee, either express
  or implied by SBA or Visa.</p>\r\n<p>The Visa and SBA Prizes will consist of
  the following for the winning teams:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>First Place Prize: $25,000</li>\r\n<li>Second
  Place Prize: $15,000</li>\r\n<li>Third Place Prize: $10,000</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Visa
  will also award one team $5,000 for best use of Visa Data and Analytic APIs,
  and one team $5,000 for the best use of Authorize.net APIs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6.
  Winner Notification: </strong></p>\r\n<p>Visa or its agent will officially notify
  each potential prize recipient by e-mail (at the e-mail address provided by
  the Participant when registering for the Challenge). In the event Visa or its
  agent is unable to contact a potential winner, despite reasonable efforts to
  do so, as determined by SBA and Visa&rsquo;s sole discretion, such potential
  winner&rsquo;s prize will be forfeited and an alternate winner will be chosen
  by SBA and Visa.</p>\r\n<p>The e-mail notifying the winners will include a link
  that contains a copy of a Release and Eligibility Agreement (the &ldquo;Claim
  Form&rdquo;) and other information required to claim the prize. All completed,
  un-amended Claim Forms must be received by Visa or its agent within ten (10)
  business days after it is e-mailed to the potential winner (&ldquo;Submission
  Deadline&rdquo;). In order to claim a prize, each potential winner must complete
  the Claim Form which includes representations of eligibility, compliance and
  release of liability and publicity release. Among other things, the submission
  of the Claim Form confirms compliance with these rules, acceptance of the prize,
  as awarded, and release of certain parties from any losses, liabilities, damages
  or claims arising from or related to the prize awarded and the Challenge itself.
  If a potential winner fails to submit the Claim Form with all information required
  by the Submission Deadline, Visa and SBA reserve the right to disqualify the
  potential winner, and Visa and SBA shall be fully and completely released and
  discharged from any liability or responsibility in this regard.</p>\r\n<p>Each
  potential winner must prove he or she is a qualified winner by providing identification
  acceptable to Visa or its agent (e.g., state driver&rsquo;s license; state issued
  identification card; valid passport with address verification; or birth certificate
  with social security card and photo identification and address verification).
  If a potential winner cannot prove he or she is a qualified winner, the prize
  will not be awarded. If a potential winner declines the prize, another winner
  with the next highest score may be selected based on the judging criteria.</p>\r\n<p><strong>7.

  and Conditions grants Participants any rights to use any Visa and SBA Marks.</p>\r\n<p>Participants
  waive any and all claims that they may have against Visa, SBA, or anyone participating
  in the Challenge. Participants also acknowledge that both Visa and SBA have
