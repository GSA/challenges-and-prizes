description: '<p><strong>NIAAA Selects Winnners of Its Wearable Alcohol Biosensor Challenge  </strong></p><p>The
  National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism announced the winners of its
  Wearable Alcohol Biosensor Challenge on May 19, 2016.The competition sought the
  design of a discreet device capable of measuring blood alcohol levels in near real-time.</p><p>The
  winning prototype and recipient of the $200,000 first prize was submitted by BACtrack,
  a company known nationally for designing and selling portable breath alcohol testers
  for consumer and professional use. Their entry, the BACtrack Skyn,
  is worn on the wrist and offers continuous and non-invasive monitoring of a user’s
  BAC. Alcohol is detected using a fuel cell technology similar to that in devices
  used by law enforcement for roadside alcohol testing. The device connects via Bluetooth
  to a smartphone to store data.</p><p>“NIAAA issued this challenge to spark innovation
  in alcohol biosensor development. We were very pleased at the level of response
  and quality of prototypes that we received from the biotech community,” said NIAAA
  Director George Koob, PhD.</p><p>For the full list of winners, see <a href="http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/niaaa-selects-winners-its-wearable-alcohol-biosensor-challenge"
  target="_blank">NIAAA''s complete announcement</a>.</p><p>The Wearable Alcohol Biosensor
  Challenge, issued through Challenge.gov in March 2015, called for non-invasive wearable
  technology that could improve upon existing alcohol biosensor technology used in
  the criminal justice system. An improved alcohol biosensor could be a valuable resource
  for the alcohol research community, decreasing reliance on participant self-report
  in scientific studies.</p><p>Background:    Current technologies for real-time monitoring
  of alcohol consumption, used in criminal justice applications, have performed adequately,
  but have disadvantages for broader use. Current technology for continuous alcohol
  monitoring takes a reading every 30 minutes.</p><p>NIAAA sought a solution that improves
  on this interval and most closely approximates real-time monitoring and data collection.
   The desired device would quantitate blood alcohol level, interpret and store the
  data, or transmit it to a smartphone or other device by wireless transmission. 
  Data storage and transmission would be completely secure in order to protect the
  privacy of the individual.  The device would have the ability to verify standardization
  at regular intervals and to indicate loss of functionality.  The power source would
  be dependable and rechargeable.  A form of subject identification would be an added
  benefit.  The device would be removable.</p><p>The challenge required written documentation
  and a working prototype of the submitted solution. NIAAA previously stipulated it
  was open to a range of design forms which can accomplish the above tasks.</p>'
