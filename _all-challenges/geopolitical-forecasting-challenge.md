description: 'Decision makers rely on the Intelligence Community to provide accurate
  and relevant forecasts, and IARPA is working to identify methods to maximize the
  quality of these forecasts. IARPAâ€™s Geopolitical Forecasting (GF) Challenge invites
  individuals or teams to develop innovative solutions and methods for integrating
  crowdsourced forecasts and other data into accurate, timely forecasts of geopolitical
  events.    Solvers will be competing against each other and in parallel with a similarly
  structured research program funded by IARPA. Overall, IARPA is seeking novel approaches
  that can help further current methodologies and improve the accuracy and timeliness
  of geopolitical forecasts. Over the course of seven months, the GF Challenge solvers
  will be asked to produce forecasts to a series of questions like:  <div id="about-questions">  <ul>    <li></li>    <li>Who
  will win the upcoming presidential election in Egypt?</li>    <li>What will the
  spot price of Brent Crude oil be on [date]?</li>  </ul>  </div>  In order to answer
  these questions, solvers will be given access to a continuously updated stream of
  forecast judgments produced by a crowd of human forecasters and will be allowed
  to use other data sources to produce their solutions. The challenge presents an
  opportunity for individuals and teams to earn prizes by creating methods that successfully
  forecast a wide variety of geopolitical events, such as political elections, international
  conflict, disease outbreaks, and macro-economic indicators.'
