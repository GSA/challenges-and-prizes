  to help raise awareness about the dangers of CO in the home.  Possible topics
  include:  How to recognize CO exposure and symptoms;  Facts about CO: You cannot
  see it or smell it. It’s an invisible killer;  What steps you can take to protect
  against CO poisoning;  How to install and test CO alarms and why they are important.    Additional
  information about the dangers of CO may be found at: www.cpsc.gov/CO.    <p></p>2.
  Eligibility  Any child who is a citizen or permanent resident of the United
  States and is in grade six, seven, or eight is eligible to participate in this
  Contest. Children of CPSC employees are not eligible to enter the Contest. To
  win a prize, a contestant must comply with the requirements and rules of the
  Contest, including submitting a Contest Submission and  Parental Consent Form.  <p></p>  3.
  How to Enter  Contestants may submit entries to the CPSC between July 14, 2014
  and February 27, 2015. Only one poster per contestant may be submitted, and
  all entries must be received by CPSC no later than February 27, 2015.  Entries
  must consist of one piece of original artwork (8 ½ x 11” poster) and a completed
  Contest Submission and Parental Consent Form.  Contestants must create the poster
  without assistance from others. The poster must not have been submitted to any
  prior CPSC poster contest or published previously. The poster must not contain
  any elements that violate a third party’s copyright or trademark rights.  Entries
  must be submitted on CPSC’s website at: www.cpsc.gov/COcontest. Attached files
  should be in the form of either a PDF or JPG and must be no larger than one
  megabyte each, if possible.  Teachers are encouraged to submit poster entries
  for students, subject to the limitation of one poster entry per student. However,
  to be eligible for a prize, each entry must include a completed Contest Submission
  and Parental Consent Form.  Once a poster is entered, a contestant cannot make
  any changes or alterations to the poster. The approximate date by which the
  judging will be complete is May 1, 2015. All decisions by the judges are final.  By
  submitting an entry to the Contest, the contestant and the contestant’s parent
  or guardian agree to be bound by the Contest’s Official Rules. This Contest
  is a skills-based contest. Chance plays no part in the determination of winners.  To
  maintain privacy, contestants should not put their name or any personal information
  on the poster. If there is identifying information on the poster, CPSC will
  remove the information.   <p></p> 4. Parent or Guardian’s Consent  Along with their
  poster submission, all contestants must also submit a completed Contest Submission
  and Parental Consent Form signed by a parent or guardian. In the Form, parents
  or guardians must provide CPSC:  permission for the Contestant to enter the
  contest;  an agreement that the Contestant will abide by the contest rules;  contact
  information to notify the parent or guardian if the poster wins a prize;  permission
  to collect, use, or disclose the child’s personal information in accordance
  with the contest rules and applicable laws.  <p></p>  5. Privacy  CPSC will collect,
  use, and disclose the information submitted in accordance with the Privacy Act
  and/or E-Government Act of 2002. Information is not collected for commercial
  marketing. <p></p>   6. Children’s Online Privacy  The safety and privacy of children
  is CPSC’s priority. CPSC complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection
  Act of 1998 (COPPA) and its accompanying regulations protecting the privacy
  of children using the Internet.  CPSC requires verifiable parental consent via
  a Contest Submission and Parental Consent Form for all contestants and requires
  this consent before CPSC collects, uses, or discloses personal information about
  children under the age of 13. CPSC requires contestants to disclose the minimum
  amount of personal information necessary to participate in the Contest. CPSC
  requires the contest winners’ parent/guardians to  provide their child''s social
  security number to process prize payment. CPSC will contact a contestant only
  through a parent or guardian.  CPSC uses the personal information about a contestant
  to administer the Contest. After obtaining parental or guardian consent via
  a Contest Submission and Parental Consent Form, CPSC will publish the contestant’s
  poster, along with the contestant’s first name, grade level, and state of residence.
  CPSC does not permit contestants to make additional information publicly available
  and will not publish personal information about contestants other than the information
  described above.  CPSC maintains reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality,
  security, and integrity of personal information collected from children, as
  described in CPSC’s Systems of Records Notice, Privacy Impact Assessment, and
  agency policies and directives. CPSC only discloses personal information as
  required by applicable laws and regulations.  If you have any questions about
  these privacy policies, you may contact CPSC at:  pdavis@cpsc.gov  At any time,
  a parent or guardian may review or have deleted the contestant’s personal information
  and may refuse to permit further collection or use of the contestant’s information
  by contacting the contest administrator at: pdavis@cpsc.gov.  To win a prize,
  a contestant must comply with the requirements and rules of the contest.   <p></p> 7.

  CPSC or represent anyone in any matter pending before the agency. Specific tasks
  related to the judging process may be delegated to CPSC employees or employees
  of a collaborating agency. Judges shall have the authority to disregard any
  minor error in an entry that does not create any substantial benefit or detriment
  to any contestant. Decisions made by the judges are final.  <p></p>  9. Judging Criteria

description: The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is sponsoring a nationwide
  carbon monoxide (CO) safety poster contest to help warn people about the dangers
  of CO. CO is called the "invisible killer" because you cannot see or smell this
  poisonous gas. Each year, about 400 people die in the United States from unintentional
  CO poisoning from fuel-burning appliances, such as furnaces, gas ranges, water heaters,
  portable generators, and charcoal grills, as well as motor vehicles.  Help stop
  the "invisible killer" by creating an original poster that warns others about the
  dangers of carbon monoxide.    Watch our video about the contest- <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Newsroom/Multimedia/?vid=70423">Carbon
