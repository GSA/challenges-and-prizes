description: "<p>Currently available escape hoods have several shortcomings for all
  hazards protection. One shortcoming is an inability of some designs to be packaged
  compactly such that it can be carried discreetly by a person, individual, or first
  responder (e.g., a form factor that fits conveniently within a suit coat inner pocket).</p>\r\n<p>A
  second shortcoming for other designs is lack of an oxygen delivery mechanism for
  respiratory protection when worn in an oxygen-deficient environment (e.g., smoke-filled).
  Current designs have incorporated solutions to one of the above shortcomings, but
  none have adequate solutions for both problems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The &ldquo;Escape
  Respirator Challenge&rdquo; prize competition, sponsored by the Department of Homeland
  Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate, seeks new concepts for an escape
  respirator solution that protects the end user against aerosolized chemical, biological
  and radiological (CBR) hazards and provides delivery of oxygen for use by people,
  individuals, and first responders. The best concepts will be relevant, usable, effective,
  and feasible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The escape respirator solutions should be capable
  of being donned rapidly and provide delivery of oxygen for safe egress from smoke-filled,
  oxygen-deficient, and CBR environments. Although commercial solutions exist, they
  do not have the small form factor desired to be carried in a coat pocket. Also,
  the weight is great due to the design and packaging of the current commercial solutions.</p>\r\n<p>This
  is a two-phased competition with a total cash prize pool of $250,000.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Phase
  I: $50,000 each for three finalists</li>\r\n<li>Phase II: $100,000 for one winner</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Furthermore,
  if the government determines that the entire project has been successfully completed,
  there continues to be a need, and there is available funding; you and DHS or any
  DHS component may attempt to negotiate one or more new agreements for the following
  purposes as authorized by law:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Follow-on prototype research and
  development (R&amp;D) contract, Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA),
  or Other Transactions Agreement (OTA) as authorized by law and applicable DHS or
  DHS component policy.</li>\r\n<li>Follow-on agreement for limited use of one or
  more completed prototypes in the DHS environment for test purposes for a minimum
  of up to one year; as authorized by applicable law and DHS or DHS component policy.</li>\r\n<li>Follow-on
  production purchase agreement in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, FAR 6.204, Section
  538 of Division F of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Public Law 115-141);
  or as otherwise authorized by applicable law and DHS or DHS component policy.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4><strong>Challenge
  Phases (Overview)</strong></h4>\r\n<p><strong>Phase I</strong> of the challenge
  seeks concepts for solutions that help a person, individual, or first responder
  escape from a toxic environment quickly and safely. Proposed solutions should meet
  the following design guidelines:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Capable of being donned rapidly
  and provide delivery of oxygen for safe egress from limited visibility, oxygen-deficient,
  and CBR environments.</li>\r\n<li>Compact, lightweight, and (optionally) capable
  of being carried in a coat pocket.</li>\r\n<li>Protect the end user against aerosolized
  chemical, biological and radiological (CBR) hazards and be protective in oxygen-deficient
  environments.</li>\r\n<li>Provide breathable air for 15 minutes (when activated);
  and up to 30 minutes in resting state of a person, individual, or first responder.</li>\r\n<li>Be
  quickly deployable after removal from packaging. A user shall be able to unpackage
  and don it within 30 seconds maximum in low/no light conditions.</li>\r\n<li>Have
  a long shelf life of 5-10 years in sealed packaging stored over a range of environmental
  (temperature and relative humidity) conditions.</li>\r\n<li>Have maximum dimensions
  of 3.5 inch width, 6.5 inch length, and 1-1.5 inch thickness.</li>\r\n<li>Have a
  maximum packaged weight of 31 ounces.</li>\r\n<li>Constructed of heat-resistant,
  transparent material that affords clear visibility for the user.</li>\r\n<li>Have
  the ability to accommodate a universal neck size (95 or higher percentile) circumference
  while maintaining a positive pressure seal.</li>\r\n<li>Must be transportable on
  a commercial aircraft.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>At the conclusion of Phase I, up to three
  (3) finalists will each receive $50,000 of the associated total cash prize purse
  of $250,000. Phase I monetary awards are anticipated to be distributed based on
  the review of the Phase I submissions by the judges. Phase I finalists will be required
  to participate in Phase II to be eligible for the Phase I monetary award.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Phase
  I finalists are required to travel to a to be determined location to participate
  in a demonstration event, currently scheduled for the week of January 27, 2020.
  Subject to available funding, invitational travel for finalists to travel to Washington,
  D.C., to present their prototype/concept may be offered.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If a finalist
  or winner is found to be ineligible, has not complied with the official ules, terms
  and conditions of this challenge, or declines the monetary prize for any reason
  prior to award, (an) alternate finalist(s) or winner may be selected.</p>\r\n<p>Monetary
  prizes awarded under Phase I will be paid to the individual or team lead directly
  by DHS&rsquo;s prize administrator (Common Pool). Phase II monetary awards will
  be paid to the winning individual or team lead directly by Common Pool. Monetary
  award prize winners are responsible for any applicable local, state, and federal
  taxes and reporting that may be required under applicable tax laws.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Phase
  II:&nbsp;</strong>If you are named as a finalist and awarded $50,000, please note
  the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You or your team will build a functioning prototype
  solution according to your submitted application within a six-month period. The
  prototype should include a prototype in hermetically-sealed packaging and an unpackaged
  prototype (without packaging).</li>\r\n<li>Up to three team members for each finalist
  should plan to travel to Washington, DC, to meet with the Prize Competition Selection
  Panel and demonstrate the merits and use of the prototype. This meeting is currently
  scheduled for the week of January 27, 2020, to compete for the Grand Prize at a
  location to be determined.</li>\r\n<li>Subject to available funding, invitational
  travel for Finalists to travel to Washington, DC, to present their prototype/concept
  may be offered.</li>\r\n<li>Each team must arrange shipping or hand-carry their
  prototype to and from the demonstration test. Prototypes should be packaged in such
  a way that proprietary design details are obscured because competing teams will
  be able to see your instruments during the testing.</li>\r\n<li>Initial check-in
  and inspection of the prototypes will take place before testing begins.</li>\r\n<li>Testing
  will last for three or five days and will allow for limited time mid-stream to resolve
  any technical issues as necessary.</li>\r\n<li>All three Finalists&rsquo; prototypes
  will be tested at once. This approach ensures all prototypes are exposed to exactly
  the same challenge.</li>\r\n<li>Testing may include how quickly the prototype can
  be removed from packaging and donned. Some evaluation of visual acuity and how easily
  oral communication can occur. Testing may also include how quickly and easily the
  supplied air can be started and how comfortable the prototype is to walk around
  in.</li>\r\n<li>Testing will NOT include exposure to hazards or require human subject
  testing as we anticipate that these prototypes will require additional development
  before being ready for this kind of advanced testing. (Additional development will
  be the subject of a future and separate contract with the competition overall winner.)</li>\r\n<li>The
  Selection Committee will be present during the demonstration.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Based
  on the outcome of Phase II, DHS has several options for further follow-up/research/development/testing
  with finalists that may lead to a commercialized solution.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Submission
  Requirements</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Submission Format: Please see complete submission
  requirements for this challenge at www.respiratorchallenge.org. The deadline for
  registration is 5:00 PM Eastern on Thursday, April 11, 2019. The deadline for submission
