prize-description-0: 'In total, SBA will award up to $1.35 million in prizes under
  this announcement. SBA will award up to $1.25 million and no more than 25 prizes
  of up to $50,000 each to cities that are selected as winners.  Due to the use
  of additional funding sources with different constraints, SBA will also separately
  award no more than two (2) prizes of up to $50,000 each to winning entries submitted
  by Native American Communities.     <br>PAYMENTS: Because the subject of this competition
  is not just the development of online tools to streamline the business startup
  process, but also the implementation and improvement of such tools, prizes will
  be disbursed in two payments. The first payment, equal to 80 percent of a winner’s
  total prize amount, will be disbursed once all initial requirements (i.e. taking
  the Startup in a Day pledge, etc.) have been met. The remaining 20 percent of
  the total prize amount will be disbursed after a winner submits a written assessment
  that includes, but is not limited to, the outcomes and outputs of its Startup
  in a Day activities as measured by the metrics outlined in its proposal, a summary
  of any lessons learned and best practices, and suggestions for any improvements
  to the design or implementation of similar competitions in the future. Winners
  must base this assessment on a period of live operation of their Startup in
  a Day web tools that is at least six (6) months and no more than twelve (12)
  months in length.     <br>ASSESSMENT: Regardless of the length of the period of
  operation on which they are based, the written assessment must be submitted
  to SBA no later than 15 months after a winner receives its first prize payment.
  The written assessments, or portions thereof, may be made public. Further guidance
  regarding the format and means of submission of these assessments will be provided
  to winners prior to their acceptance of prizes.    <br>ACH and SAM: All prizes will
  be paid via the Automated Clearing House (ACH) and winners will be required
  to create an account in the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to receive
  their prizes.'

  the U.S. Census Bureau) or <strong>American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian
  communities, or their constituent agencies and subdivisions</strong>.</p><p>See more
  details regarding eligibility rules for participating in the competition under "Rules."</em></p><p>The
  SBA is seeking to support entrepreneurs who are navigating the requirements to start
  a business.Currently many of these requirements are in multiple locations and
  a streamlined approach could help entrepreneurs startup more easily. The Startup
  in a Day Competition – Start Small Model is designed to spur the development, implementation,
  and improvement of online tools that will let entrepreneurs learn about the business
  startup process in their area, including how to register and apply for all required
  local licenses and permits, in one day or less.</p><p>In order to maximize the success
  of this Competition, SBA will work with the National League of Cities (NLC), an
  advocacy organization representing thousands of municipalities, to establish a formal
  mechanism by which all Startup in a Day Competition winners will be able to collaborate
  and share best practices.</p><p>In conjunction with the Startup in a Day Competition,
  President Barack Obama is asking cities and Native American Communities across America
  to take a pledge to support entrepreneurs in their area by making it easier to start
  a business (for the text of this pledge, see sba.gov/startup). While it is not required
  to enter this Competition, all cities and Native American Communities are encouraged
  to take the pledge. As an additional encouragement, entries submitted by cities
  and Native American Communities that do take the pledge will receive five (5) bonus
  points during the evaluation process, as stipulated in Item 3: Part V below. Furthermore,
  all Startup in a Day Competition – Start Small Model winners will be required to
  take the pledge prior to receiving their prizes.</p>'
