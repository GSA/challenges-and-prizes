description: "Challenge objectives include designing, building and delivering flight-qualified,
  small satellites capable of advanced operations near and beyond the moon.  The challenge
  and prize purse are divided into three major areas:\r\n-- Ground Tournaments: $500,000
  in the four qualifying ground tournaments to determine who will have the ability
  to fly on the first SLS flight;\r\n-- Lunar Derby: $1.5 million purse for demonstrating
  communication and CubeSat durability at a distance greater than almost 2.5 million
  miles (4,000,000 km), 10 times the distance from the Earth to the moon; and\r\n--
  Deep Space Derby: $3 million purse for demonstrating the ability to place a CubeSat
  in a stable lunar orbit and demonstrate communication and durability near the moon.\r\n\r\nThe
  Cube Quest Challenge seeks to develop and test subsystems necessary to perform deep
  space exploration using small spacecraft.  Advancements in small spacecraft capabilities
  will provide benefits to future missions and also may enable new mission scenarios,
  including future investigations of near-Earth asteroids."
