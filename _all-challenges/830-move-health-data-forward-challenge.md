    <p>The Move Health Data Forward Challenge encourages participants to create an application programming interface (API) solution that uses the implementation specifications created by the&nbsp;<a href="http://openid.net/wg/heart/">HEART Workgroup</a>&nbsp;(Heart WG) to allow people to securely authorize the movement of their health data to destinations they choose.</p>
    <p>The HEART WG was developed to advance the process of gathering representatives from many different health-related technical communities worldwide (private-sector, government and non-governmental organizations) working in areas such as patient authentication, authorization, and consent &ndash; to collaborate on developing open-source specifications.</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://openid.net/wg/heart/">HEART WG</a>&nbsp;has created a set of privacy and security specifications (HEART implementation specifications) using the following open standards:&nbsp;<a href="http://oauth.net/2/">OAUTH 2.0</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://openid.net/developers/specs/">OpenID Connect</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/draft-uma-core.html">User Managed Access</a>&nbsp;(UMA). These specifications empower people to control the authorization of access to health-related data sharing APIs.</p>
    <p>Participants are expected to engage people to test the implementation of the Solution and make possible processes that need consumers to authorize the release of their health data to a destination they choose. Participants must recruit individuals and obtain their authorizations to test the implementation of the Solution using their health data. The data for the API and Solution should be provided by Phase 2 finalists.</p>
    <p>The Challenge will have three phases and two finalists each winning $75,000. Phase 1 will award $5,000 for up 10 finalists each based on the proposals they submit to the Challenge. Phase 1 winners will move to Phase 2, which will award $20,000 for up to 5 finalists each based on the prototype of their Solution. Phase 2 winners will move to Phase 3, which will award $50,000 for up to two winners each based on the participant&rsquo;s ability to implement their Solution.</p>
    <p>This multi-phased approach allows participants to assemble, implement and test their Solutions. The final phase of the Challenge will require finalists to show a consumer-facing Solution that incorporates the HEART implementation specifications and uses an API that empowers consumers to control the movement of their health data.</p>
    <p>This Challenge encourages participants to apply independently or team with others including health IT developers, health care providers and other entities with the appropriate expertise related to this Solution. Lessons learned and the Challenge&rsquo;s results will be shared in order to support other organizations implementing solutions that make possible consumer-mediated exchange.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Questions about the Move Health Data Forward Challenge can be posted to the Discussion section and will be regularly monitored.&nbsp;</p>
