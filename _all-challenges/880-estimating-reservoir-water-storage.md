    <p>Water storage in reservoirs behind dams is a vital component for water management, and the amount available defines the delivery of benefits from reservoirs. Available water storage, over time, decreases as sediment deposition occurs, thus decreasing the capacity for storage. &nbsp;This sediment deposition, known as sedimentation, also adversely affects reservoir infrastructure operation and maintenance such as outlet works and water intakes. Assessing the loss of storage capacity currently is an expensive and time consuming process performed directly by in-field surveys. The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is seeking a cost effective method to indirectly estimate the storage capacity and/or sediment volume (storage loss) in reservoirs.</p>
