description: <p><strong>We are seeking new fish tracking capabilities that can significantly
  reduce costs and dramatically increase the effectiveness and efficiency of various
  fish recovery efforts led by federal, state, local, and/or other organizations.
  </strong>    <strong>Enter the competition: <a href="https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933646"
  target="_blank">https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933646</a></strong></p><p>The
  ability to track fish is central to efforts to recover threatened and endangered
  fish species and reduce impacts to at-risk species. Reliable, affordable detection
  and tracking provides vital information about how many fish are present, where and
  why mortality occurs, and where and why species thrive. This information enables
  fish recovery program managers to pursue targeted and more effective actions that
  can reduce mortality rates, improve habitat, and increase survival rates while continuing
  to meet Reclamation's mission.</p><p>Federal and non-federal resource managers require
  the ability to identify and monitor fish and other aquatic animals.  Fish, in particular,
  use different habitats, from small streams to deep fast-flowing rivers, and large
  lakes and oceans.  A common challenge faced by fish recovery managers is the need
  to monitor movements of free-swimming individual fish without repeated capture and
  handling.    https://youtu.be/mCw_1zhLybg  </p><p>  The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration
  with other federal agencies (U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
  NOAA-National Marine Fisheries Service, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) are looking
  for detailed concepts for the next generation of fish tracking methods, beyond what
  is available and in the literature today. Emphasis is on accurate tracking of many
  fish, ease of use, longevity, and low cost.  </p><p>  The goal of this Challenge is to
  generate new concepts for tracking fish that advance technologies that meet fish
  recovery program management needs at a reasonable cost.  A solution is being pursued
  through a prize competition because the Bureau of Reclamation and the collaborating
  federal agencies view it beneficial to seek innovative solutions from those beyond
  the usual sources of potential solvers and experts that commonly work in the fish
  recovery management domain. We find ourselves often wondering if somebody, somewhere
  may know a better way of tracking and monitoring fish for our purposes than the
  methods we currently use.</p><p>The prize competition approach enables us to reach a
  new source of potential Solvers to generate new and timely solutions that would
  not likely be accomplished by standard contractual methods.    <em>Submissions to
  this Challenge must be received by 11:59 PM (US Eastern Time) on August 26, 2015. 
  Late submissions will not be considered.</em>    </p><p><strong>This is an Ideation Challenge,
  which has the following unique features:</strong>  <ul>   <li><strong>There is a
  guaranteed award</strong>.  The awards will be paid to the best submission(s) <strong>as
  solely determined by the Seeker</strong>.  The total payout will be <strong>$20,000</strong>,
  with at least one award being no smaller than <strong>$5,000</strong> and no award
  being smaller than <strong>$2,500</strong>.</li>  </ul>  <ul>   <li>All intellectual
  property rights, if any, in the idea or concept demonstrated by the Proposed Solution
  will remain with the Solver.  UPON SUBMISSION OF a Proposed Solution to this Challenge,
  each Solver agrees to grant to the Seeker a ROYALTY-FREE, PERPETUAL, IRREVOCABLE,
  NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO USE by or on-behalf of the U.S. federal government ANY
  INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS PROPOSAL IN ANY FORUM, OR SUBSEQUENT EFFORTs TO FURTHER
  DEVELOP THE CONCEPT INTO A VIABLE SOLUTION and to allow others to do so. Notwithstanding
  granting the Seeker a perpetual, non-exclusive license for the PROPOSED SOLUTION,
  The Solver retains ownership of the IDEA OR CONCEPT DEMONSTRATED BY THE PROPOSED
  SOLUTION.</li>  </ul>  <ul>   <li>The Seeker believes there might be a potential
  for future collaboration with awarded Solver(s), although such collaboration is
  not guaranteed.  The Seeker may also encourage Solver(s) to further develop and
  test their winning submissions through subsequent round(s) of competition.  Solvers
  should make it clear if they have the ability for subsequent design and development
  phases and would be willing to consider future collaborations and/or subsequent
  competitions.</li>  </ul>  <ul>   <li>See the Challenge Specific Agreement and the
  <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/07/27/2015-18157/announcement-of-requirements-and-registration-for-a-prize-competition-seeking-new-concepts-for">Federal
  Register Notice</a> for full details</li>  </ul>  After the Challenge deadline,
  the Seeker will evaluate the submissions  and make a decision with regards to the
  Winning Solution(s).  All Solvers that submitted a proposal will be notified on
  the status of their submissions; however, no detailed evaluation of individual
  submissions will be provided. </p><p>Decisions by the Seeker cannot be contested.</p>
