non-monetary-incentives-awarded: The Prize Purse for the PerfLoc Prize Competition
  is a total of $35,000. In addition, up to five finalists, the designated official
  representative in the case of a team or a legal entity, will be provided invitational
  travel funds to travel to the NIST campus in Gaithersburg, MD for live tests
  of their apps. Up to three finalists will be selected as winners at the App
  Demo Days at NIST. The number of winners will be less than three if there are
  less than three finalists invited to the PerfLoc App Demo Days due to the level
  of participation in the PerfLoc Prize Competition or if fewer than three finalist
  apps generate location estimates within five seconds of a request to generate
  one all the time. NIST is looking for indoor localization and tracking Android
  apps that work in real-time. Up to three winners will be provided invitational
  travel funds by NIST to showcase their apps at the 2017 IPIN Conference in Sapporo,
  Japan. The Prize Purse may increase, but will not decrease. Any increases in
  the Prize Purse will be posted on the Event Website. NIST reserves the right
  to announce additional winners of non-cash prizes.

rules: '<h3 class="h3-rule-heading">Rules for being eligible to participate in
  the Competition:</h3> <p><em><strong>NOTE: competition timeline was extended
  until January 17, 2018. Top-ranked teams were invited to PerfLoc Demo Days at
  NIST on April 26-27, 2018 where the winner was determined.</strong></em></p><p>Participation
  in the PerfLoc Prize Competition is open to ALL; however, not all participants
  are eligible to win cash prizes as explained in the next section.</p><p>Each Competition
  Participant (individual, team, or legal entity) is required to register on the
  PerfLoc website and create ONE password-protected user account. There shall
  be one Official Representative for each Competition Participant. To create a
  user account, the Official Representative must provide a name, username, password,
  email address, and geographical location, and affirm that he/she has read and
  consents to be governed by the Competition Rules.</p><p>Multiple accounts per Participant
  are NOT allowed. At NIST''s discretion, any violation of this rule will be grounds
  for disqualification from the Competition. Multiple individuals and/or legal
  entities may collaborate as a team to submit a single entry, in which case the
  designated Official Representative will be responsible for meeting all entry
  and evaluation requirements. Participation is subject to all U.S. federal, state
  and local laws and regulations. Individuals entering on behalf of or representing
  a company, institution or other legal entity are responsible for confirming
  that their entry does not violate any policies of that company, institution
  or legal entity.</p><p>During the competition testing period, Participants are
  allowed a total of <strong>150</strong> uses of the PerfLoc Performance Evaluation
  Portal and a maximum of three uses per day. At NIST''s discretion, any violation
  of this requirement will be grounds for disqualification from the Competition.
  Modifications and improvements to a Participant''s App during the competition
  testing period are to be expected, but the Participant should have one final
  App ready at the end of the competition testing period.</p>  <h3 class="h3-rule-heading">Rules
  for being eligible to win a cash prize:</h3>  <p>To be eligible for a cash prize:  <ul>    <li>A
  Participant (whether an individual, team, or legal entity) must have registered
  to participate and complied with all of the requirements under section 3719
  of title 15, United States Code as contained herein.</li>    <li>At the time
  of Entry, the Official Representative (individual or team lead, in the case
  of a group project) must be age 18 or older and a U.S. citizen or permanent
  resident of the United States or its territories.</li>    <li>In the case of
  a private entity, the business shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary
  place of business in the United States or its territories.</li>    <li>Participants
  may not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their
  employment. NIST employees and NIST Research Associates as well as direct recipients
  of NIST funding awards for NIST projects in the development of an Android app
  in the area of the challenge are not eligible to participate. Non-NIST Federal
  employees acting in their personal capacities should consult with their respective
  agency ethics officials to determine whether their participation in this Competition
  is permissible.</li>    <li>Any other individuals or legal entities involved
  with the design, production, execution, distribution or evaluation of the PerfLoc
  Prize Competition are also not eligible to participate.</li>    <li>A Participant
  shall not be deemed ineligible because the Participant consulted with Federal
  employees or used Federal facilities in preparing its submission to the PerfLoc
  Prize Competition if the Federal employees and facilities are made available
  to all Participants on an equitable basis.</li>  </ul></p><p>  In addition, interested
  Participants who do not meet the eligibility requirements to win a prize (i.e.,
  individuals who are neither a US citizen nor a permanent resident of the United
  States or non-US-based entities) are encouraged to participate in the Competition.
  They are invited to register on the PerfLoc website, download the data sets,
  and use the PerfLoc Performance Evaluation Portal according to the PerfLoc Prize
  Competition Rules. The performance obtained by these Participants will be displayed
  on the PerfLoc website in the same manner as the performance obtained by Participants
  who are eligible to win cash prizes.</p>  <h3 class="h3-rule-heading">How to participate
  in the Competition:</h3>  <p>An interested party (individual, team, or legal entity)
  must initiate the process of participating in the Competition by registering
  at the PerfLoc website and creating a user account. The party is then allowed
  to download a number of smartphone data sets collected by NIST from the PerfLoc
  website. In the event NIST determines modifications to the data sets are needed,
  all website registrants will be notified by email.</p><p>The party becomes a Participant
  once he/she has built a smartphone indoor localization and tracking Android
  App (i.e., working software application that operates on a Wi-Fi and GPS enabled
  Android smartphone with possibly cellular service) AND has had the App evaluated
  at least once through the PerfLoc Performance Evaluation Portal. An entry consists
  of the file(s) uploaded to the PerfLoc Performance Evaluation Portal and, in
  the case of the Finalists, the App demonstrated at NIST (hereinafter referred
  to as an "Entry").</p><p><i>Types of PerfLoc Data</i>    The PerfLoc website contains
  two types of data sets: training data and test data, collected by NIST researchers
  in four buildings using four different Android smartphones. Details for these
  two types of data sets are provided below:  <ol>    <li><i>Training data:</i>
  These are similar to solved problems in a textbook. There are a total of four
  training datasets, one for each of the buildings in which NIST collected data.
  For each training data set, NIST is providing the ground-truth locations of
  the test subject that collected the data at a number of time instances during
  the course of data collection. Participants can compare the location estimates
  generated by their Apps at the abovementioned time instances with the ground-truth
  locations to decide how well their Apps are doing. Based on such comparisons,
  the Participants can modify their Apps and hopefully develop better versions.
  Participants should not upload location estimates for training data sets, because
  the ground truth locations for designated time instances in those data sets
  have already been provided to them.</li>    <li><i>Test data:</i> There are
  multiple test data sets, corresponding to various Test &amp; Evaluation Scenarios,
  for each of the four buildings in which NIST collected data. There are also
  a number of time instances associated with each test data set that are available
  for download from the PerfLoc website. Participants are asked to upload location
  estimates generated by their App for ALL the designated time instances for each
  test data set. The Participants must provide such location estimates for ALL
  test data sets.</li>  </ol> </p><p> <i>App Requirements</i>  <div class="figure-border">  <figure><img
  class="img-responsive" src="https://perfloc.nist.gov/images/Localization_Images/Horizontal_Error.jpg"
  alt="Horizontal error" width="520" height="323" /><figcaption><small>Horizontal
  Error: One of the performance metric specified in ISO/IEC 18305</small></figcaption></figure>  </div></p><p>Participants
  should create an original indoor localization and tracking Android-based App.
  Note that Finalists invited to the PerfLoc App Demo Days will be required to
  run their Apps on a NIST-provided Google Pixel XL smartphone running on Android
  7.1.2 Nougat OS. The Apps must be able to compute location estimates in real-time
  based on the data collected by the smartphone in the course of the tests to
  be administered at that event. Each time requested to generate a location estimate,
  the App should produce the estimate within five seconds.</p><p><i>PerfLoc Performance
  Evaluation Portal Scoring</i>    Each App is evaluated over the web instantly
  when the Participant uploads on the PerfLoc Performance Evaluation Portal the
  location estimates generated by the App at the designated time instances. The
  Participant has to upload such location estimates for <strong>all test data
  sets, but not for training data sets</strong>. Each upload of location estimates
  for test data sets constitutes one use of the PerfLoc Performance Evaluation
  Portal.</p><p>The PerfLoc Performance Evaluation Portal will instantly return five
  values of a single performance metric, namely spherical error 95% (SE95), whose
  definition is included in the Appendix to this document. One SE95 value is returned
  for each of the four buildings and an overall SE95 value is returned for all
  time instances and all test data sets. This is another way for the Participant
  to know how well his/her App is performing and what steps to take, if any, to
  make it better.</p><p>The following formula will be used for assigning up to 80
  points based on the overall SE95 performance (in meters):    <span class="mjx-chtml

  Participant data uploads must be completed by 5:00 PM EDT (UTC-05:00) on August
  17, 2017. Uploads to the PerfLoc Performance Evaluation Portal before or after
  the competition testing period will not be evaluated or considered for award.
  Entries sent to NIST in any manner other than through the Event Website will
  not be evaluated or considered for award.</p><p>The best performance of an App
  (i.e., the best score of data generated by the App and uploaded to the portal)
  will be listed in the publically available rank-ordered table of performances,
  along with the Participant''s username, name, geographic location and the date
  and time of the data upload. If a Participant modifies his/her App, but the
  modification results in a lower score than the highest score obtained by the

  standard ISO/IEC 18305 will be computed for the best version of the App developed
  by each Participant and will be published on the PerfLoc Website.</p><p><i>Judging</i>    The
  NIST Director will appoint a highly qualified judge. The judge will be a NIST
  employee with expertise in public safety and advanced communications. The Judge
  will determine winners according to the Judging Criteria described below. The
  Judge may not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer,
  director, or agent of, any entity that is a registered Participant in the Competition
  and may not have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who
  is a registered Participant. In the event of such a conflict, the Judge must
  recuse himself or herself and a new Judge may be appointed.</p>  <h3 class="h3-rule-heading">Basis
  on which finalists and winners will be selected:</h3> <p><b>Finalists:</b> The
  top 3-5 Participants, as determined by their standing on the PerfLoc Performance
  Evaluation Portal at the end of the competition testing period, who are also
  eligible to receive a cash prize and have complied with the Rules of the Competition,
  will be selected as the Finalists. A minimum of three Finalists will be selected
  assuming that are at least three Participants who meet the eligibility and compliance
  requirements stated above. NIST may select up to two more Participants satisfying
  the abovementioned requirements as Finalists if the overall SE95 performance
  of their Apps are within 20% of the overall SE95 performance of the top Finalist.
  This is an opportunity for the fourth and fifth Finalists to break into the
  top three slots and declared as winners of cash prizes based on the points awarded
  at the PerfLoc App Demo Days at NIST. Therefore, there is an incentive for the
  Participants to develop not just an algorithm that yields the best overall SE95
  performance, but also an App that runs in real-time and, each time requested,
  generates a location estimate as fast as possible (e.g.,in less than five seconds).</p><p>Upon
  receipt of an email from NIST informing you of your selection as a Finalist,
  you must respond within 48 hours to confirm your eligibility and willingness
  to attend the PerfLoc App Demo Days at NIST in person. If any of the selected
  Finalists is unable to attend the PerfLoc App Demo Days, NIST will make an attempt
  to select other Participants as Finalists, time permitting and if warranted.
  In the unlikely event of tie scores on the Leaderboard, Participants will be
  rank ordered by the time stamp of their best overall SE95 performance, with
  the earliest time ranking highest. These Participants (individuals, teams, or
  legal entities) constitute the Finalists and they (the Official Representative
  in the case of a team or legal entity) will be invited to attend the PerfLoc
  App Demo Days on the NIST campus in Gaithersburg, MD. NIST will arrange and
  pay for the Official Representatives for the Finalists to travel to NIST to
  take part in the PerfLoc App Demo Days.</p><p>At the PerfLoc App Demo Days Event,
  the finalists will install their Apps on a NIST-provided Google Pixel XL smartphone
  running on Android 7.1.2 Nougat OS and undergo testing in a NIST building. Each
  Finalist will also make a 10-minute presentation followed by audience question
  and answer. NIST reserves the right to run security scans on the installed App
  to ensure there is no risk to NIST IT systems during the Perfloc App Demo Days
  Event. At the event''s conclusion, NIST will remove the Participants'' app software
  from the NIST smartphones.</p><p><b>Winners:</b> The Winners of cash prizes will
  be determined by a Judge appointed by the NIST Director, using the Judging Criteria
  outlined here.</p><p><i>Judging Criteria:</i>  <ol>    <li>Overall Performance
  on the PerfLoc Performance Evaluation Portal (up to 80 points)  <ol>    <li>Using
  the final ranking at the close of the competition testing period, a score of
  up to 80 points will be calculated using the Scoring Methodology described above.</li>  </ol>  </li>    <li>Performance
  during App Demo Days at NIST (20 points)  <ol>    <li>Localization accuracy
  and latency of the App</li>  </ol>  </li>  </ol></p><p>  <strong>If a Finalist at the
  PerfLoc App Demo Days does not have a functioning App, he/she will be disqualified
  from winning a prize.</strong> Specifically, an App is required to generate
  a location estimate, each time requested, in real-time (e.g., less than five
  seconds).</p><p>NIST will announce the Finalists via the Event Website as well
  as those Finalists that have been awarded a cash award (each, an "Award"). The
  anticipated number and amount of the Awards that will be awarded for this Competition
  is set forth in these rules; however, NIST is not obligated to make all or any
  Awards, and reserves the right to award fewer than the anticipated number of
  Awards in the event an insufficient number of eligible Apps meet any one or
  more of the Judging Criteria for this Competition, based on NIST''s sole discretion.
  Using the Judging Criteria, a highly-qualified Judge (NIST employee appointed
  by the NIST Director) will determine the winners of the Perfloc Prize Competition.</p><p>The
  winner verification process for being eligible to receive an Award includes
  providing the full legal name, tax identification number or social security
  number, routing number and banking account to which the prize money can be deposited
  directly. Return of any notification as "undeliverable" will result in disqualification.
  After verification of eligibility, Awards will be distributed in the form of
  electronic funds transfer addressed to the Official Representatives specified
  in the winning Entries. That Official Representative will have sole responsibility
  for further distribution of any Award among Participants in a group Entry or
  within a company or institution that has submitted an Entry through that representative.
  The list of Entries receiving Awards for the Competition, including the names
  of all members of a team, will be made public according to the timeline outlined
  on the Event Website.</p><p>Winners are responsible for all taxes and reporting
  related to any Award received as part of the Competition.    All costs incurred
  in the preparation of Competition Entries are to be borne by Participants.</p><h3
  class="h3-rule-heading">Demonstration of winning Apps at 2018 Microsoft Indoor
  Localization Competition:</h3></p><p>Up to three Winners selected at the
  PerfLoc App Demo Days at NIST may be invited by NIST to attend 2018 Microsoft
  Indoor Localization Competition, tentatively to be held at 2018 IEEE IPSN, Porto,
  Portugal, April 11-13, 2018. The Winners will be required to go through another
  round of demos and evaluations, even though these evaluations will not affect
  their status as Winners. The purpose of these demos and evaluations is for the
  conference participants, who do not have the opportunity to attend PerfLoc App
  Demo Days at NIST, to see how well the Winning Apps perform. The Winners may
  also make a 10-minute presentation on their Apps followed by audience question
  and answer.</p><p>NIST will arrange and pay for the travel of the Official Representatives
  of the invited Winners to the conference to cover eligible travel costs such
  as airfare, conference registration fee, and lodging.</p><p>The test and presentation
  event is also an opportunity for Participants who are not eligible to win cash
  prizes to showcase their Apps. NIST may invite up to three such Apps to be showcased
  (demo and presentation)  in place of one or more Winning Entries (cash prize
  recipients), if their overall SE95 performance is better than one or more of
  the Winning Entries.</p><h3 class="h3-rule-heading">Point of Contact for the Competition:</h3>  Questions

description: '<p><em><strong>NOTE: competition timeline was extended until January
  17, 2018. Top-ranked teams were invited to PerfLoc Demo Days at NIST on April 26-27,
  2018 where the winner was determined.</strong></em></p><p>This competition is
  about developing the best possible indoor localization and tracking app for Android
  smartphones. Indoor localization is the capability to determine/estimate the location
  of an entity to be localized or tracked, such as a person, a robot, or some other
  object equipped with an appropriate electronic device in buildings and subterranean
  structures such as tunnels, caves, and underground mines. Localization and tracking,
  whether indoors or outdoors, has a wide range of applications, including emergency
  response and law enforcement. Other applications include fleet management, asset
  tracking in factories/warehouses/hospitals, tracking the elderly/children, personal
  navigation in museums and shopping malls, social networking, and the Internet of
  Things (IoT).</p><p>PerfLoc Prize Competition participants are required to use the
  extensive Android smartphone data repository developed by NIST to develop their
  apps and have their apps’ performance evaluated through the PerfLoc Performance
  Evaluation Portal.  The Prize Purse for the PerfLoc Prize Competition is a total
  of $35,000. In addition, up to five finalists will be provided invitational travel
  funds to travel to the NIST campus in Gaithersburg, MD for live tests of their apps
  at App Demo Days February 15-16, 2018. Up to three finalists will be selected as
  winners at the App Demo Days at NIST. Up to three winners will be provided invitational
  travel funds by NIST to showcase their apps at the 2018 IEEE IPSN Conference in
  Porto, Portugal, April 11-1, 2018. </p><p>   <em>To Enter:</em>  <ol>    <li>Visit the
  <a href="https://perfloc.nist.gov/">website</a> for the PerfLoc Prize Competition</li>    <li>Create
  an account at the PerfLoc website (see lower left bar)</li>    <li>Following the
  <a href="https://perfloc.nist.gov/perfloc-competition-rule.php">Rules</a> and other
  information on the PerfLoc website, develop and test your App at the PerfLoc Performance
