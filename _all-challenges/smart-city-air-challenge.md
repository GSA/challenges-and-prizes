description: 'EPA has selected two awardees of the <a href="https://developer.epa.gov/smart-city-air-challenge/">Smart
  City Air Challenge</a>: the City of Baltimore and the Lafayette, La. Consolidated
  Government. For more information about the challenge and webinars about data management
  of community air quality projects, visit the challenge website at <a href="https://developer.epa.gov/smart-city-air-challenge/">https://developer.epa.gov/smart-city-air-challenge/</a>.
  The agency also has recognized four projects for honorable mention: New York City;
  Mesa County, Colo.; Raleigh, N.C. and Minneapolis/St. Paul.    The following two
  projects were selected as awardee recipients:  <ul>    <li><em><strong>An Air Quality
  Sensor Network for Greater Baltimore</strong>:</em> This Baltimore project incorporates
  plans to engage several partners and neighborhoods to deploy a network of sensors
  in a phased approach, leveraging a scalable cloud platform for data management.
  They plan to assemble commercially-available components to build their sensor system
  and distribute the data on a City of Baltimore website.</li>    <li><em><strong>Lafayette
  Engagement and Research Network (LEaRN)</strong>:</em> This Lafayette, La., project
  proposes a partnership between collegiate, local government and non-governmental
  organizations to deploy a network of sensors. The project has a strong data management
  plan that will use a scalable cloud platform. They plan to use commercially-available
  sensors for the project and share the data with the public in a variety of ways.</li>  </ul>  EPA
  is recognizing these four projects for honorable mention because of their innovation
  and potential to help other communities:  <ul>    <li><strong><em>Healthy Mesa County
  &amp; Mesa County Health Department: Smart City Air Challenge Solution</em></strong>:
  Mesa, Colo.</li>    <li><strong><em>Air Quality Crowdsourcing Data in Minneapolis/St.
  Paul</em></strong>: Minneapolis/St. Paul</li>    <li><strong><em>New York City Air
  Casting Project: EPA Smart City Air Challenge Solution</em></strong>: New York</li>    <li><strong><em>Citizen
  science with Ground-Level Ozone Wearables Sensors (GLOWS) for real-time pollution
  maps across the Research Triangle</em></strong>: Research Triangle, N.C.</li>  </ul>  Although
  the challenge is closed, EPA will be available as a resource to the winners and
  honorable mention project teams to share knowledge about how they collect, store
  and manage large amounts of data. EPA encourages these communities and others to
  share their findings so other communities can learn from their successes, challenges
  and lessons.    <hr />    <p>Here’s a chance for communities to demonstrate their leadership
  in managing hundreds of air quality sensors at the local level.    EPA is challenging
  communities across the country to collect data using hundreds of air quality sensors
  as part of the Smart City Air Challenge. The agency is offering up to $40,000 apiece
  to two communities to help them develop and implement plans for collecting and sharing
  data from air quality sensors.  </p><p>  To qualify for the challenge, communities will
  need to submit plans for deploying hundreds of air quality sensors and managing
  the data they collect. EPA will award up to $40,000 apiece to up to two communities
  that have the best data collection strategies, including their plans to share their
  data management methods with other communities. The award money only covers part
  of the program costs, so communities will need to partner with sensor manufacturers,
  data management companies or others to get resources and expertise to implement
  their plans.    - <strong>See EPA''s <a href="https://developer.epa.gov/smart-city-air-challenge-resource-pages/">challenge
  resource pages</a></strong> about air quality sensors, data management and more.    -
  <strong>Attend <a href="https://developer.epa.gov/smart-city-air-challenge-webinar-series/">webinars
  about the challenge</a></strong>.  </p><p>  After a year, EPA will evaluate the two projects
  and award up to an additional $10,000 to the winning communities based on their
  accomplishments and collaboration.    The challenge is open from August 30, 2016
  to October 28, 2016. Through the challenge, communities have the opportunity to
  adopt the paradigm of big data, citizen science, and the Internet of Things as they
  address air quality problems that are relevant to them. </p><p>   The challenge is designed
  to inspire communities to discover new approaches to managing data for air topics
  they care about, then develop solutions and share them. It is experimental in nature
  and EPA expects to learn how communities handle data from many sensors. The challenge
  prize funds are meant to be seed money, not the full amount for procuring sensors
  and data management services. EPA is ready to provide background information through <a
  href="https://developer.epa.gov/smart-city-air-challenge-resource-pages/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">Resource Pages</a> that list EPA’s research and similar experiences
  in other communities, <a href="https://developer.epa.gov/smart-city-air-challenge-webinar-series/">webinars about
  the challenge</a> and a <a href="https://developer.epa.gov/frequently-asked-questions/">Frequently
  Asked Questions</a> page.  </p><p>  EPA prefers that the sensors and the resulting data
  are of good quality. Although standards exist for measuring criteria pollutants
  (see Designated EPA Reference and Equivalent Methods at <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/amtic/criteria.html"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/amtic/criteria.html</a>),
  there are no standards for measuring air quality for non-regulatory or non-enforcement
  purposes. For the challenge, communities will need to describe the level of accuracy,
  precision and reliability of the sensors and how they will ensure these attributes.
  The data from these projects will belong to the projects and will be available for
  others to use. EPA recommends that communities carefully evaluate the quality of
  sensors and the associated data. Please refer to the sensor resource page to learn
  more about independent sensor testing by EPA and others.   </p><p> The challenge encourages
  communities to create solutions and identify best practices that other communities
  can adopt and benefit from. In doing so, they will advance the theme of Information
  Technology Infrastructure and New Data Streams, as mentioned in EPA''s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-09/documents/roadmap-20130308.pdf"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Draft Roadmap for Next Generation of Air Monitoring</a>.
  Through their projects, communities will help each other and EPA “face challenges
  presented by the ever increasing amounts of sensor-generated data, the analytics
  needed to translate data into knowledge, and how to make sensor data available for
  discovery and integration with data from other allied disciplines.”  </p><p>  EPA expects
  the challenge to yield several benefits, such as identifying best practices for
  managing big data at the community level, how to engage citizens in collecting data
  about their community, and how to use data from many sensors to understand environmental
  condition and its relationship to human health.</p><p>    <strong>Constraints</strong><br>  Submissions
  will be judged based on the constraints and performance criteria outlined below.
  Before being scored against weighted performance criteria, entries must meet the
  four constraints listed below. Submissions that do not meet the constraints must
