prize-description-0: "<p>Phase 1: Design 7-10 winners Up to $10,000 will be awarded
  to each winner. Submission Period: August 2018 Submit your best ideas to support
  the development of low-cost, scalable technology-based innovations to help families
  and case managers with the care and coordination of CSHCN. Phase 2: Development
  and Small-Scale Testing 3-5 winners Up to $25,000 will be awarded to each winner.
  Submission Period: Fall 2018 &ndash; Spring 2019 The winners from Phase 1 of
  the prize competition will then advance to Phase 2, where they will focus on
  prototyping their proposed intervention and testing its effectiveness. Both
  the evidence base for their proposed intervention and its usefulness should
  be demonstrated. Mentors will be available to provide feedback on testing methodologies
  and to provide more information about the evidence base. Phase 3: Scaling 1
  winner Up to $150,000 will be awarded. Submission Period: Spring 2019 &ndash;
  November 27, 2020 In the final phase, winners of Phase 2 will test their proposed interventions
  on a larger scale. Applicants are encouraged to work closely with a community
  or city to facilitate scaling the intervention in order to reach more families.
  This will show: Scalability of the intervention at low cost Feasibility of implementation
  Impact on the intended outcomes.</p>"

description: "Submissions for this challenge will be accepted on the Maternal and
  Child Health Bureau Grand Challenges site.\r\n\r\nThe Care Coordination for CSHCN
  Challenge will support the development and testing of low-cost, scalable, technology-based
  innovations to meet the needs of children with special health care needs (CSHCN)
  and their families. Innovations should improve the quality of care, enhance family
  engagement, and positively impact health care outcomes with the potential of saving
  costs to families, society, and to the health care system. CSHCN and their families
  are the primary stakeholders for all solutions proposed. In order to deliver improved
  outcomes for this stakeholder group, it is understood other stakeholders across
  the health care system, including providers and payers, should be involved. Solutions
  proposing to improve any or all aspects of the overall health care system, with
  the intent of driving better outcomes for children and families, will be preferred.\r\n\r\nCSHCN
  have or are at risk for having a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or
  emotional condition and require health and related services beyond what a typical
  child needs. CSHCN account for approximately 20% of the US pediatric population.
  An estimated 0.5% are children with medical complexity, children with multiple chronic
  conditions who often require the care of a complex array of medical and other support.\r\n\r\nFor
  CSHCN, coordinated care by their care team, including family members, primary, specialty,
  and service providers, is essential to their health and well-being. However, communication
  and coordination across systems of care is often fragmented. Too often, family members
  of CSHCN serve the care coordinator role and assume full responsibility for aggregating
  and sharing health information across providers and settings. Families deserve complete,
  comprehensive, and easily accessible information about their children's health and
  their care plan to ensure the best quality of care.\r\n\r\nHealth information technology
  (HIT) provides an opportunity to organize data from disparate sources into one cohesive
  patient-centered record that can effect optimal care coordination and planning for
  care team members across multiple systems and settings. HIT standards are available
  to support the bi-directional exchange of care plans and necessary health informatics
  for CSHCN. Despite this, most attempts to facilitate the electronic exchange of
  records and the sharing of right information in a timely manner among care team
  members have neither been scalable nor patient/family-centered."
