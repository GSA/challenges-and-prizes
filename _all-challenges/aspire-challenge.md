description: '<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>** BEGIN STATUS UPDATE 3/14/2017**</strong></p>  <strong>Thank
  you for the interest in the Aspire Challenge and to all contestants who submitted
  potential solutions.  Award decisions under this challenge are delayed. Once we
  have further information, we will notify all contestants via email and on www.challenge.gov/aspire-challenge.
   </strong>  <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>**END STATUS UPDATE 3/14/2017**</strong></p>  &nbsp;    The
  Aspire Challenge is a prize competition conducted under the America Competes Act.
  The objective of this competition is to spur the development and provision of innovative
  entrepreneurial development and access to capital resources for formerly incarcerated
  individuals or those who are non-violent ex-offenders. The submission period for
  entries will begin on December 29, 2016 and close on February 12, 2017. The SBA
  anticipates that winners will be announced no later than March 14, 2017.    The
  U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) official established in 1953, maintains
  and strengthens the nation''s economy by aiding, counseling, assisting, and protecting
  the interests of small business, and by helping families and businesses to recover
  from national disasters. The SBA''s mission includes assisting small businesses
  to start, grow, and compete in markets by providing quality training, counseling,
  and access to resources.    Providing meaningful economic opportunities to individuals
  who have completed prison sentences is a critical solution to an increasingly alarming
  problem.  Of the 600,000 individuals released on average each year from federal
  prisons, an estimated 60 percent remain unemployed one year after their release,
  raising the risk of recidivism and resulting in lost lifetime earnings. In fact,
  two-thirds of these individuals historically are rearrested within three years of
  their release.    This challenge competition is separate but builds on the momentum
  of the Aspire Entrepreneurship Initiative, a public-private partnership announced
  in August 2016 between the SBA, W.K. Kellogg Foundation, and Justine PETERSEN. The
  three-year initiative is a pilot to test entrepreneurship education programming
  and microloan assistance through SBA Microloan Intermediaries to formerly-incarcerated
  individuals in St. Louis, MO; Chicago, IL; Louisville, KY; and Detroit, MI. The
  goal of the Aspire Challenge is to source additional innovative solutions in other
  areas in the United States beyond these four metropolitan areas. This challenge
  also aligns with other actions identified by the Federal Interagency Reentry Council,
  a Cabinet-level working group to support the Federal Government''s efforts to promote
  public safety and economic opportunity through purposeful cross-agency coordination
  and collaboration.    The Aspire Challenge will serve as a catalyst to leverage
  business formation as a tool for economic mobility and self-employment for the formerly
  incarcerated through the design and delivery of intensive entrepreneurial education
  and increased access to microloans. This competition is designed to award prizes
  to entrepreneurial support organizations that propose innovative and sustainable
  solutions to equipping the formerly-incarcerated with the education and technical
  assistance they need to start and grow a business.'
