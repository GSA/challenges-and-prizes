rules: "<h3>Stages</h3>\r\n<p>By the Challenge deadline Solvers should submit
  a white paper that describes a device for providing direct current power to
  electronic instruments on rotating shafts meeting the specific Solution Requirements
  presented in the Detailed Description of the Challenge. This description should
  be accompanied by a well-articulated rationale supported by literature/patent
  precedents and include experimental proof-of-concept data obtained as outlined
  in the Detailed Description of the Challenge.</p>\r\n<p>The total award pool
  for the Challenge is $250,000. Awards will be available in two phases: an initial
  Phase 1 award up to $50,000, and a final Phase 2 award reflecting the balance
  up to $250,000.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Phase 1 Selected Solvers will be informed within
  six weeks of the Challenge deadline if they have been selected for the initial
  award and whether a prototype device is requested by the Seeker for experimental
  validation in a laboratory and/or field-scale demonstration. Following notification,
  Solvers are expected to have a prototype ready to be shipped within a maximum
  of 8 weeks, so that the Seeker can start evaluation. Because of these requirements,
  the whole evaluation period is expected to last up until 6 months from the Challenge
  Deadline. Phase 1 award may vary from $5,000 to $50,000 for solutions that meet
  all of the criteria. At the Seekers&rsquo; discretion, the Solver may be invited
  to attend and assist in activities during prototype evaluation.</p>\r\n<p>Phase
  2 awards from the remainder of the total pool of $250,000 will be granted for
  a novel method that results in a solution experimentally validated, with a minimum
  award of $25,000. In addition to the direct monetary award Reclamation will
  invite industry, non-profit organizations, and venture capital representatives
  for the demonstrations.&nbsp; Participating industry and venture capital representatives
  will have the ability to seek and secure potential business deals with Solvers.</p>\r\n<p>The
  Challenge award will be contingent upon results of critical analysis and evaluation
  by the Seeker and the judging panel appointed by the Seeker.&nbsp; As such,
  the meeting of the Solution Requirements does not guarantee that the proposed
  solution will be awarded by the Seeker.&nbsp; Partial cash prizes may be considered
  for solutions that meet some, but not all, of the criteria.</p>\r\n<p>Submissions
  to this Challenge must be received by 11:59 PM (US Eastern Time) on December
  6, 2018.&nbsp; Late submissions will not be considered.</p>\r\n<h3>Eligibility</h3>\r\n<p>To
  receive a Phase 1 award, the Solvers will not have to transfer their exclusive
  IP rights to the Seeker.&nbsp; Instead, Solvers will grant to the Seeker a non-exclusive
  license to practice their solutions. The Solver will not receive an Award if
  Solver cannot provide Seeker with the non-exclusive license to the Solution
  IP on the terms set forth in the Challenge-Specific Agreement. Solvers who have
  transferred their IP rights in their solution to another party, or otherwise
  entered into any commercial exclusive arrangement with another for the exploitation
  of their IP rights in their solution prior to the end of the Challenge shall
  not be eligible for a Challenge award.&nbsp; Please note that any proposal submitted
  will not be treated as confidential information.&nbsp; Accordingly, Solvers
  should take whatever steps they deem necessary to protect their proprietary
  rights in their solutions prior to submitting their written proposal for consideration
  in the Challenge (e.g. filing provisional or full patent applications on the
  solution described in the written proposal submitted prior to submission).&nbsp;
  See the Challenge-Specific Agreement on the <a href=\"https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933885\">InnoCentive

description: "<h3>Abstract</h3>\r\n<p>The Bureau of Reclamation and its collaborators
  are seeking devices to provide direct current power for loads of up to 20 watts
  to electronic instruments on rotating shafts for hydropower generating units.&nbsp;
  Presently, no practical methods exist for continuously powering these instruments
  on a rotating shaft.&nbsp; Solutions can be novel approaches or can build upon existing
  methods or technologies.&nbsp; The total prize purse for this reduction to practice
  challenge is $250,000.</p>\r\n<p>This is a two-phase Reduction-to-Practice Challenge
  that requires (Phase 1) written documentation, proof-of-concept data and, (Phase
  2, if requested by the Seeker) sample/prototype delivery for experimental validation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Challenge
  Orientation Video:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU_tcGD9iAI\">Watch
  subject matter experts</a> from Reclamation discuss the need for methods to power
  instruments on a rotating generator shaft.</p>\r\n<h3>Overview</h3>\r\n<p>Reclamation
  is the second largest hydropower producer in the nation, operating 53 powerplants
  with a generation capacity of 14,730 megawatts and more than 40 billion kilowatt-hours
  of electricity produced annually.&nbsp; Reclamation&rsquo;s hydropower generating
  units are expected to safely and reliably produce the power that is delivered to
  the western electric grid.&nbsp; Monitoring these generators provides a critical
  advancement toward keeping these units operational and reducing costly outages -
  in a small power plant, an unforeseen outage can result in an opportunity cost of
  $30,000 per day per unit; for a large power plant, this cost can be up to $800,000
  per day per unit.&nbsp; However, the monitoring instruments require a continuous
  power source in order to keep them online and performing their key role.&nbsp; New
  solutions are needed to permanently install low-power instruments on a rotating
  shaft in order to collect continuous data pertinent to generator operation and performance.</p>\r\n<p>Presently,
  the available power sources for electronic instruments on rotating shafts include
  batteries and contact solutions.&nbsp; Powering the electronic instruments with
  a battery does not provide continuous operation and requires generator downtime
  to replace the batteries, resulting in lost power generation.&nbsp; Existing contact
  solutions for this application, such as slip rings, have unacceptable installation
  and maintenance requirements because their components in physical contact degrade
  over time.&nbsp; Non-contact solutions include emerging technologies, such as wireless
  energy transfer, that may prove beneficial but are not yet developed for this application.</p>\r\n<p>Reclamation
  and our collaborators seek novel methods and technologies to reliably provide direct
  current power for loads of up to 20 watts (20 W) to electronic instruments on rotating
  shafts.&nbsp; Proposed solutions must be applicable to rotating shafts that are
  18- to 144-inch diameter, whether during rotation (72 to 550 rpm), standstill, before
  generator rotation begins or after it ends. We seek new devices or significant improvements
  to existing methods and technologies, as long as the improvements offer substantial
  enhancement.</p>\r\n<h3>About the Collaborators</h3>\r\n<p>The U.S. Army Corps of
  Engineers and Bonneville Power Administration are collaborating with Reclamation
  on various aspects of this Challenge such as design, technical review, judging,
  and promotion.</p>"
