description: 'The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (<a href="https://www.cdfifund.gov/Pages/default.aspx"
target="_blank">CDFI Fund</a>) plays an important role in generating economic growth
and opportunity in some of our nation’s most distressed communities. By offering
tailored resources and innovative programs that invest federal dollars alongside
private sector capital, the CDFI Fund serves mission-driven financial institutions
that take a market-based approach to supporting economically disadvantaged communities.    The FY
2016 CDFI Fund Prize Competition seeks to stimulate innovation that will build capacity
to expand CDFI investments and increase access to capital in underserved rural areas,
particularly those that are characterized by persistent poverty. The CDFI Fund will
reward selected applicants with monetary prizes, totaling up to $1,000,000, for
innovative proposals that (1) identify and promote new ideas and practices, thereby
facilitating their implementation by CDFIs that serve rural areas, and/or (2) create
value during and after the competition by encouraging CDFIs that serve rural areas
to develop new skills or practices that may have beneficial effects on the rural
areas they serve.    The CDFI Fund envisions there will be two types of applicants:  <ol>    <li>An
innovative idea or strategy, implemented within the past two years, that helped
increase CDFI investments and access to capital in underserved rural areas; or</li>    <li>An
innovative idea or strategy that <em>has not yet been implemented</em>, but is reasonably
expected to increase CDFI investments and access to capital in underserved rural
areas.</li>  </ol>  <p>Judges will select the winning entries according to judging
criteria. <strong>Please click on the following link to view the evaluation criteria:

target="_blank">FY2016 CDFI Fund Prize Evaluation Criteria</a></strong>. The CDFI
Fund may choose to distribute the prize in one or more payments. In addition, the
CDFI Fund may require prize awardees to submit reports detailing progress implementing
the proposed solution and/or any outcomes.    Judges may also select entries for
Honorable Mention based on the judging criteria in order to highlight and promote
success stories and best practices.  Applicants listed as Honorable Mention will
not be awarded a financial prize. The Winning Entries, and Honorable Mention applicants, will
be recognized on the contest and CDFI Fund websites. The CDFI Fund may invite contest
winners and honorable mention applicants to participate in post-award events or
communications.    For purposes of this competition, a “rural area” is defined as
a county or counties that are considered non-Metropolitan Areas under the CDFI Program’s
regulations (12 CFR 1805.104). An area that is characterized by “persistent poverty”
is defined as any county or Native community that has had 20 percent or more of
its population living in poverty over the past 30 years, as measured by the 1990,
2000, and 2010 decennial censuses.</p><p> <strong>Please click on the following link to

been updated as of July 21, 2016 to include eligible areas for the U.S. Territories
based upon alternative census data other than the decennial census due to data limitations.**</span>    The
CDFI Fund’s definition of a “Native Community” is an American Indian, Alaska Native,
or Native Hawaiian community. The CDFI Fund uses the Office of Management and Budget’s
definitions of “American Indian or Alaska Native” and “Native Hawaiian”: “American
Indian or Alaska Native” refers to "a person who has origins in any of the original
peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains
tribal affiliation or community attachment," and “Native Hawaiian” refers to “a
person having origins in the original peoples of Hawaii”. (OMB Statistical Policy
Directive No. 15, Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative
Reporting, 62 Fed. Reg. 58782, October 30, 1997)</p>'
