    <p>The U.S. Department of Energy Solar District Cup Collegiate Design Competition (Solar District Cup) challenges multidisciplinary student teams to present forward-thinking solutions and to design and model optimized distributed energy systems for a campus or urban district.</p>
    <p>The competition engages students across engineering, finance, urban planning, sustainability, and other disciplines or degree programs to reimagine how electric energy is generated, managed, and used in urban areas. Students analyze electric-distribution grid interactions and assume the role of a solar-plus-storage developer to produce a proposal for a district use case.
