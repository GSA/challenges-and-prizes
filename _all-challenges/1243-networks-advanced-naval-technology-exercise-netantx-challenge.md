  #### General Overview


  Consider a scenario where the Naval Force is operating in a highly contested environment and most communication paths are denied. In this scenario, only a few modes and links that operate at low kilobit per second data rates and below. Such a network is characterized by: 


  * sparsely connected nodes

  * multi-hop needed to support end-to-end application flows

  * low kilobit per second data rate links

  * dynamic and unpredictable connectivity based on locations and radio frequency (RF) channel effects

  * network demand exceeds available network resources


  Each of the above conditions poses a significant challenge to network operation. Yet, the Navy must operate under the combined effects of all the above conditions. This challenge seeks innovative technologies that will maximize the utility of this very limited network, specifically by enabling efficient, low-overhead routing of application packets.
