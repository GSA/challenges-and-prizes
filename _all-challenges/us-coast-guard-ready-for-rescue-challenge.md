  font-family: proxima-nova-n6, proxima-nova, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial,
  sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The United States Coast Guard&rsquo;s Research and
  Development Center (USCG RDC) in conjunction with the DHS Science and Technology
  Directorate (S&amp;T) is seeking new&nbsp;<span style=\"box-sizing: border-box;
  text-decoration: underline;\">concepts for a solution that helps make people lost
  in the water easier to find and rescue</span>. The best concepts will be effective,
  affordable, and hold the potential for wide adoption by recreational mariners and
  boaters. Submitted concepts may be for a new or updated lifejacket or personal floatation
  device (PFD), an attachment to a lifejacket/PFD, or something recreational mariners
  and boaters use in addition to wearing their lifejacket/PFD.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing:

  proxima-nova, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As
  the nation&rsquo;s maritime first responder, the USCG is devoted to helping mariners
  and boaters in distress. Within this mission, one critical challenge is finding
  people who are lost in the water.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin:
  0px 0px 10px; color: #555555; font-family: proxima-nova-n6, proxima-nova, 'Helvetica
  Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">When a person falls off
  of a recreational watercraft (boat, kayak, Jet Ski, paddle craft, etc.), they can
  be left isolated in open waters. A life jacket or personal floatation device (PFD)
  is a must for survival, keeping a person afloat while they wait for rescue. But
  a person lost in the water is a small, moving target and it can sometimes take hours
  before rescue teams are able to locate them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #555555; font-family: proxima-nova-n6, proxima-nova,
  'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">New recreational
  mariner safety solutions have the potential to greatly improve the chances of a
  successful rescue. Current technologies such as dyes, personal locators, and reflective
  materials in lifejackets/PFDs can help the U.S. Coast Guard better find people,
  and are shown to improve rescue rates. However, adoption of these technologies remains
  low, due to factors like cost, comfort, style, and awareness.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing:
  border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #555555; font-family: proxima-nova-n6,
  proxima-nova, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">With
  the U.S. Coast Guard Ready For Rescue Challenge, the USCG and DHS S&amp;T calls
  upon innovators from a wide variety of fields&mdash; from Public Safety, Maritime
  Safety, Recreational Sports, Consumer Goods and Materials, Wearables, Textiles,
  Smart Technologies, and the Internet of Things&mdash; to develop concepts for a
  new or updated lifejacket/PFD, attachment to a lifejacket/PFD or something recreational
  mariners and boaters use in addition to wearing their lifejacket/PFD that will enable
  search and rescue personnel to more readily find and rescue a person in the water.
  The USCG and DHS S&amp;T intends for this work to be the first step in the design
  of new, improved or adapted technologies that can be leveraged by current USCG Search
  and Rescue assets to locate and rescue a person in the water faster.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing:

  I of the Challenge seeks concepts for novel and scalable solutions that help make
  people lost in the water easier to find and rescue. Solutions should help to improve
  the success of the search and rescue mission and may be a new or updated lifejacket/PFD,
  an attachment to a lifejacket/PFD, or something recreational mariners and boaters
  use in addition to wearing their lifejacket/PFD. Proposed solutions must work with
  at least one existing USCG asset, including the human eye, personal locators, audio,
  homing beacons, wave infrared, GPS, X Band Radar, near infrared, and other sensor
  mechanisms. A full list of USCG assets and additional reading and resources can
  be found at http://readyforrescuechallenge.com. Solutions should not discourage
  recreational mariners and boaters from purchasing or wearing a lifejacket/PFD or
  give the impression that it is a substitute for wearing a lifejacket/PFD. Note that
  solutions cannot include a signal flare or pyrotechnic device.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing:

  awards are anticipated to be distributed based on the review of the Phase I submissions
  by the judges. In addition to the monetary prize awards, up to five (5) honorable
  mention award winners will be selected by the judges and invited to participate
  in Phase II of the Challenge. Phase I monetary prize winners will be required to
  participate in Phase II to be eligible for the Phase I monetary award. Honorable
  mention non-monetary award winners will be invited, but not be required, to participate

  to the USCG Research and Development Center (RDC) in New London, CT to participate
  in a &ldquo;Piranha Pool&rdquo; pitch. (See Phase II information below). The DHS

  announced). Prior to the beginning of Phase III, the USCG and DHS S&amp;T will open
  Phase III to a limited number of additional contestants that did not participate
