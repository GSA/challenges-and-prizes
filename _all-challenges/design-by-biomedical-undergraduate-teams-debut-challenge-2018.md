  of their participation, however, the names of foreign students who are part
  of winning Student Teams will be listed among the winning team members when
  results are announced and at the award ceremony.    d) Must be a member of only

  understanding and acceptance of the DEBUT challenge rules by signing the <a

  and dated by each individual member of the Student Team. Entries that do not
  provide a complete Certification Form will be disqualified from the challenge;    <strong>*Forms
  must contain an actual signature. Handwriting-like fonts are not acceptable
  substitution. Forms without actual signatures will be considered incomplete
  and could result in disqualification from the challenge.</strong>    (2) Each
  entry into this challenge must have been conceived, designed, and implemented
  by the Student Team without any significant contribution from other individuals.    (3)
  Federal grantees may not use Federal funds to develop their Challenge submissions

  contractors may not use Federal funds from a contract to develop their Challenge
  submissions or to fund efforts in support of their Challenge submission.    (5)
  Submissions must not infringe upon any copyright or any other rights of any
  third party.    (6) By participating in this Challenge, each individual and
  entity agrees to assume any and all risks and waive claims against the Federal

  in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of
  property, revenue, or profits, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising
  from participation in this Challenge, whether the injury, death, damage, or
  loss arises through negligence or otherwise.    (7) Based on the subject matter
  of the Challenge, the type of work that it will possibly require, as well as
  an analysis of the likelihood of any claims for death, bodily injury, property
  damage, or loss potentially resulting from Challenge participation, no individual
  participating in the Challenge is required to obtain liability insurance or
  demonstrate financial responsibility in order to participate in this Challenge.    (8)
  By participating in this Challenge, each individual agrees to indemnify the
  Federal government against third party claims for damages arising from or related
  to Challenge activities.    (9) An individual shall not be deemed ineligible
  because the individual or entity used Federal facilities or consulted with Federal
  employees during the Challenge if the facilities and employees are made available
  to all individuals and entities participating in the Challenge on an equitable
  basis.    (10) By participating in this challenge, such individuals grant to
  NIBIB an irrevocable, paid-up, royalty-free, nonexclusive worldwide license
  to post, link to, share, and display publicly the entry on the Web, newsletters
  or pamphlets, and other information products. It is the responsibility of the
  individuals on the Student Team to obtain any rights necessary to use, disclose,
  or reproduce any intellectual property owned by third parties and incorporated
  in the entry for all anticipated uses of the entry.    (11) NIH reserves the
  right, in its sole discretion, to (a) cancel, suspend, or modify the Challenge,

  regarding the Student Team’s entry. The Team Captain must be a citizen or permanent
  resident of the United States.    </div>'
