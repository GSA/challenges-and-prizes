rules: 'Terms and Conditions: ORNL Buildings Community    <strong>Introduction:</strong>    UT-Battelle,
  LLC, managing and operating the Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL) pursuant to its
  Prime Contract with U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is hosting three crowdsourcing
  idea campaigns (Campaigns):  <ul>   <li>Space Conditioning and Appliance Ideas</li>   <li>Sensors
  and Controls Ideas</li>   <li>Envelope Technologies Ideas</li>  </ul>  The goal
  of the idea Campaigns is to bring buildings sector stakeholders from industry,
  academia, and government, and technology innovation together, which will enable
  stakeholders to potentially shape the energy efficient building solutions reaching
  the market.    The UT-Battelle team will rely on website users to vote on the
  best ideas with potential for transforming the building energy efficiency technologies
  market. A shortlist of the top five ideas per Campaign will be identified based
  on the highest number of votes received per idea. A group of independent technical
  judges consisting of UT-Battelle staff and other industry stakeholders will
  review the shortlisted ideas. The technical judges will evaluate the ideas based
  on criteria such as technical feasibility, energy saving potential, market size,
  and novelty of the idea. The technical judges will then select the best one
  or two ideas per Campaign. The best one or two ideas will be recognized during
  Industry Day taking place at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in September
  of 2015. The submitters of the best ideas will potentially be invited to attend
  Industry Day, at their own expense, to present their idea or participate in
  panel discussions.    These Campaigns are being administered by UT-Battelle
  using the IdeaScale web platform. IdeaScale, UT-Battelle, and DOE, hereinafter
  “Supporters,” are cooperatively working to administer the Campaigns.    <strong>Important
  Dates:</strong>  <ul>   <li>Submission Period Begins: Friday, February 20, 2015.</li>   <li>Submission
  Period Ends: Sunday, May 31, 2015 at 11:59 p.m. EST.</li>   <li>UT-Battelle
  reserves the right to modify the Submission, judging and/or voting periods at
  any time for any reason. IdeaScale’s server is the official time-keeping device
  for this Contest.</li>  </ul>  <strong>How to Enter:</strong>  <ul>   <li>If
  you do not have an IdeaScale account, visit <a href="http://buildings.ideascale.com/a/register">http://buildings.ideascale.com/a/register</a>

description: 'Submit your design ideas for energy efficient buildings technologies
  to Oak Ridge Laboratory’s crowdsourcing community. The best technical ideas will
  get recognized at ORNL Industry Day, in presentations and possibly with 3-D printed
  prototype of the design. By combining the ORNL crowdsourcing community with the
  state-of-the-art capabilities at ORNL, innovators can rapidly collaborate with ORNL
  and other industry partners to develop the next big thing for the buildings market,
  allowing residential and commercial buildings customers to save money and energy.    New
  submissions and voting by online community members will run through the end of May.
  Ideas could be submitted within one of the three campaigns: Equipment &amp; Appliances,
  Sensors &amp; Controls, and Envelope Technologies. The five ideas with the highest
  votes per campaign will then be reviewed by a team of independent judges including
  ORNL building experts and industry partners. Judges will evaluate the technical
  feasibility of the top ideas. The judges will identify the best one idea per campaign
  that are technically feasible and with the greatest potential energy savings by
  the end of June. Design idea drawings or other supplemental materials may be requested,
  and prompt response is required to ensure timeliness of prototype 3-D printing.'
