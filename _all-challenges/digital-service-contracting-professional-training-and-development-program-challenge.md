  II: Program Design</strong>    The Phase I finalists will receive $20,000 each and
  will have one month from the date of this award, to transform their program concepts
  into a detailed program designs, which meet the requirements provided below. One
  finalist will be selected as the winner of the challenge.  The winner’s name will
  be posted on Challenge.gov.    The finalists chosen in Phase I shall prepare a detailed
  program design, including the following three sections:  <ul>   <li><strong>Program
  Description</strong>  <ul>   <li>More details on the major content focus areas with
  their performance objectives,</li>   <li>Comprehensive Syllabus</li>   <li>Defined
  instructional strategies and educational method for each content area,</li>   <li>Mock-ups
  or prototypes,</li>   <li>Proposed speaker lists,</li>   <li>How a digital assignment
  will be incorporated into the program,</li>   <li>An understanding of how the program
  components will achieve the desired program outcomes,</li>  </ul>  </li>   <li><strong>Assessment
  Plan</strong>  <ul>   <li>More details on the planned assessment of how well the
  students have achieved the objectives of the program;</li>   <li>A remediation plan
  for trainees who do not achieve the goals; and</li>   <li>A concept for a Capstone
  or Practical Skills Test that might be required for certification.</li>  </ul>  </li>
  \  <li><strong>Anticipated Cost to Implement Program</strong>  <ul>   <li>The estimated
  investment required to implement both the pilot and the resulting program. The pilot
  would be estimated on a basis of 30 students as will the resulting program. If the
  pilot is a scaled-down version of the fully-implemented program, the differentiation
  must be explained.</li>   <li>Any expected intangible benefits related to the program,
  or ways to leverage quantities of scale strategies to facilitate a widespread adoption
  of the program in the government.</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  <br><strong>Phase II Oral
  Proposal </strong>    This program design will be presented to the judges through
  oral proposals. Additionally, a one hour mock classroom training shall be provided
  to the judges in order for the challengers to demonstrate one aspect of their proposed
  design. It will be up to the challenger to determine which aspect and method of
  delivery will best encompass the concept of their proposed design.    <br><strong>Phase
  III:  Program Development and Pilot</strong>    The challenge winner receives up
  to $250,000 in milestone payments and will have five months to develop and implement
  their design with up to 30 government contracting students.  Milestone payments
  will be made based on mutually agreed upon deliverables throughout the pilot based
  on the accepted design. An initial milestone payment will be determined to assist
  with the startup costs of the pilot.    OMB will select and provide students for
  the pilot project.  The students in the pilot project will be selected from contracting
  professionals who are certified at the Federal Acquisition Certification – Contracting
  (FAC-C) or Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) Level II or above.
  These pilot students are the target demographic for the program, are influential
  early adopters of new and innovative acquisition strategies, and will have some
  experience in IT acquisition. These students will have managerial commitment and
  approval to fully participate and meet the requirements of the pilot; however it
  is anticipated that pilot participants will be not required to be 100% assigned
  to the pilots for the entire length of the program, and will remain in their current
  jobs during the pilot.    <br><strong>Assignment:</strong>   In order to help judge
  the effectiveness of the training and development program, as part of the pilot,
  the Federal contracting students will be expected to complete a “live” digital service
  assignment, which could be an actual project, procurement, or agency engagement.
  OMB will work with the Phase II winner to determine which assignment is best-suited
  for its specific pilot based on its proposed design.    In this phase, the training
  and development program is developed and major components are piloted by the Phase
  II winner with up to 30 students to validate the content, feasibility, instructional
  strategies, and expected outcomes of the training program. There shall be complete
  lesson plans, participant materials, mock-ups and prototypes, and training aids
  to test during the pilot delivery. The pilot program delivery is the “test drive”
  of the proposed challenge solution to determine whether it meets expected outcomes.
  In addition to the students assigned to the pilot, OMB will provide key stakeholders
  and government subject matter experts who can provide other limited assistance required
  to develop and pilot the program as requested by the challenger in Phases I and
  II. OMB will assist the Phase II winner with the identification of current Procurements/Projects/Digital
  Service teams that students will be assigned to work on during the course of the
  pilot. The nature of the assignment chosen will be based on a discussion between
  the Phase II winner and OMB during pilot program preparation.  Sample assignments
  might include:  <ul>   <li>Conducting a solicitation from Request For Proposal to
  Award to establish a Federal-wide Blanket Purchase Agreement.</li>   <li>Working
  with a Digital Service Agency team on drafting a Request for Proposal.</li>   <li>Assisting
  GSA’s 18F with a consulting effort and resulting acquisition.</li>   <li>Drafting
  a Digital Service Agency team’s acquisition strategy for multiple projects/acquisitions.</li>
  \ </ul>  Submission shall include an end user survey to be delivered to the students
  based on the proposed program concept which will be used to determine how confident
  the participants are in their ability to apply the knowledge and skills learned.
  \   <br><strong>Final Submission: Results of Pilot and Update of Proposed Program </strong>
  \   Upon completion of the pilot, the following information shall be provided to
  OMB by January 31, 2016 to help OMB judge the outcome of the proposed training and
  development program:  <ul>   <li>Results of the assessment of how well the students
  achieved the objectives of the proposed program, and update of the proposed remediation
  plan and concept for a Capstone or Practical Skills Test that might be required
  for certification;</li>   <li>Any logistical problems that surfaced in the execution
  of the pilot (this could relate to scheduling challenges, absenteeism on behalf
  of the participants, physical or logical roadblocks encountered), including what
  was done to resolve the problems, or what should be done if a scaled program were
  to be implemented to ensure success;</li>   <li>The pilot’s actual cost breakdown
  including contract services, equipment, facilities, hardware, software, training
  materials, as it relates to the proposed submission (this could include return on
  investment evaluations and alternative analyses);</li>   <li>An accountability report
  that captures how well the pilot was executed (pilot’s projected cost breakdown
  compared to the actual cost breakdown) and how quality was measured to get the expected
  results of the pilot.</li>   <li>The documented program design incorporating lessons
  learned and any changes made to the design initially proposed;</li>   <li>The final
  estimated investment required to implement the proposed program; and</li>   <li>A
  description of how Return on Investment (ROI) should be monitored (e.g., linkage

description: 'Winner Update:    <p>The Challenge Managers, Traci Walker and Joanie Newhart,
  both of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), made the call to notify <strong>Team
  ICF International and ASI Government</strong> that their program design had been
  selected as the winner of the Digital Service Contracting Professional Training
  and Development Program challenge. This means they will have the opportunity to
  partner with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and the US Digital Service
  to pilot their training program with 30 Federal contracting professionals and help
  foster transformative change in the Federal Digital Service acquisition culture.    The
  winning program design comprises customized learning paths, self-directed learning,
  guided learning, and a live digital assignment.</p><p>During the six month pilot, which
  kicks off on October 20, 2015, the challenge winner will work in close collaboration
  with OFPP and the U.S. Digital Service to test its concepts and produce the first
  cohort of certified digital service contracting experts. After successful completion
  of the pilot and incorporation of lessons learned, the final program design will
  be turned over to federal acquisition training institutions for implementation.
  This challenge is only the beginning of OMB’s efforts to develop digital service
  and IT expertise for contracting professionals, program managers, and other stakeholders.</p><p>The
  US Digital Service and Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), as part of the
  Office of Management and Budget (OMB), give notice of the availability of the “Digital
  Service Contracting Professional Training and Development Program” prize competition
  and rules. Through a multi-phased challenge, participants are eligible for prize
  money up to $360,000.00 under this competition.</p><p>In August 2014, the US Digital
  Service was launched to bring in the country’s brightest digital talent to transform
  how government works for American citizens and businesses by dramatically improving
  the way government builds and buys digital services.</p><p>On December 4, 2014, Anne
  Rung, Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, issued a memorandum titled Transforming
  the Marketplace: Simplifying Federal Procurement to Improve Performance, Drive Innovation,
  and Increase Savings.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a></p><p>In this memorandum,
  Administrator Rung lays out several initiatives for driving greater innovation and
  strengthening Federal acquisition practices, one of which is building digital information
  technology (IT) acquisition expertise.</p><p>As part of this initiative, OFPP and the
  U.S. Digital Service are working together to focus on improving the process of IT
  acquisition, and specifically the acquisition of digital services. OFPP and the
  US Digital Service recognize the need for improving and simplifying the digital
  experiences that citizens and businesses have with the Government.</p><p>Strengthening
  digital services expertise in the Government is a key component of being able to
  reduce the risk of failed acquisitions and systems, and save taxpayer dollars.</p><p>
  The Digital Service Contracting Professional Training and Development Program prize
  competition seeks to spur innovation in the training and development of Federal
  Contracting Professionals who are fundamental to the success of digital service
  acquisitions. Through program concept white papers, up to three design presentations,
  and a pilot program, the effectiveness and feasibility of innovative training and
  development program approaches will be explored.</p><p>Please send inquiries or questions
  to Challenge@omb.eop.gov or post to the discussion thread on challenge.gov    <strong>Objective: 
  </strong>The goal of this prize competition is to develop a Digital Service Contracting
  Professional Training and Development Program for the Federal Government, which
  will be used to add a digital service core-plus specialization for contracting professionals
  under the Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting (FAC-C) Program issued
  by OFPP<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a>.</p><p>The final results of the challenge
  will be provided to Federal training institutions, such as the Federal Acquisition
  Institute (FAI) and Defense Acquisition University (DAU), for those institutions
  to implement and maintain the program. This program will be one of many initiatives
  to foster transformative change in the Federal Digital Service acquisition culture.</p><p>The
  optimal comprehensive training and development program, intended for Federal Contracting
  Professionals, specifically Contracting Officers and Contract Specialists, will
  enable them to understand and apply strategic thinking, industry best practices,
  market place conditions, and appropriate acquisition strategies to the procurement
  of digital supplies and services. An ideal training and development program will
  be no longer than 6 months in total, and may include strategies such as rotational
  assignments, mentoring, in-classroom training, and detail assignments woven into
  an innovative approach to accomplish the stated objectives. A definition of a successful
  digital service buyer, novel ideas, leading-edge approaches, and iterative methodologies
  are highly encouraged in response to this Challenge.</p><p>Digital services, as defined
  by OMB, refers to “the delivery of digital information (data or content) and transactional
  services (e.g., online forms, benefits applications) across a variety of platforms,
  devices, and delivery mechanisms (e.g., websites, mobile applications, and social
  media).” Digital services may be delivered to customers either internal or external
  to the Government, or both.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[ii]</a></p><p>The primary
  outcomes of this Digital Service Contracting Professional Training and Development
  Program are that participating Federal contracting professionals:  <ul>   <li>Become
  digital service procurement experts;</li>   <li>Are equipped with the knowledge
  necessary to be imbedded within agency Digital Service teams to serve as a business
  advisor to the team, its customers, and its stakeholders; and</li>   <li>Have the
  knowledge to lead agency training, workshops, and consultations in order to expand
  digital service procurement expertise within their agency and the government.</li>  </ul>  Specifically,
  the program must teach Federal Contracting Professionals how to:    (1) Understand
  and procure digital services and supplies utilizing concepts such as those described
  in the Digital Services Playbook <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[iii]</a> and
  the TechFAR<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[iv]</a> (e.g, DevOps, UX, Design Services,
  Agile Software Development, Open Source, Cloud, Iaas, SaaS, and PaaS);    (2) Appropriately
  measure the success of these contracts based on industry standards;    (3) Accurately
  describe and define the value received; and    (4) Encourage the use of commercial
  practices and innovative approaches (e.g. modular contracting, broad agency announcements,
  challenges and prizes) to ensure procurements can capture flexible and rapidly changing
  technology advancements.</p><p>The prize challenge will include three phases. <br><strong>Phase
  I</strong> asks for participants to submit a white paper that describes their concept
  for a training and development program that will meet the stated objectives. Up
  to three Phase I submissions will be selected as finalists and move to <br><strong>Phase
  II</strong>. These finalists are awarded $20,000 each in prize money to design in
  more detail their proposed concept program. At the end of Phase II, these finalists
  will present their in-depth program designs at an oral presentation and a one hour
  mock classroom training to a panel of Federal senior leaders. One winner will be
  selected and moves to <br><strong>Phase III</strong>, which requires that participant
  to develop and pilot its program for approximately 30 students.</p><p>In Phase III<strong>,</strong>
  up to $250,000 in milestone payments will be provided to assist the participant
  in developing their proposed pilot for a training and development program that can
  be easily adopted and implemented by the Government. Upon completion of Phase III,
  the finalist can win up to $50,000 in additional prize money for developing a program
  that fully met the stated objectives.</p><p>The pilot will be held in the Washington,
  DC area with local students. However, approaches for the proposed program that include
  virtual components to allow participation of students outside of the Washington,
  DC area (with some in-person sessions required) and/or self-pacing are highly encouraged,
  but must also demonstrate cost effectiveness.    <a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1"></p><p>[i]</a>
