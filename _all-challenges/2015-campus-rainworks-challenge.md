rules: '<strong>Eligibility:</strong>    <p>To compete in the Campus RainWorks Challenge,
  †each student team must be affiliated with a degree-granting public or private
  institution of higher education located in the U.S. and†sponsored by a †faculty
  advisor. All team members must be enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate degree
  program †at an eligible college or university as of August 31, 2015.    </p><p><strong>Submission
  Categories:</strong>    To encourage participating teams to assess the environmental,
  economic, and social benefits of green infrastructure at a range of spatial
  scales, EPA is accepting submissions in two design categories: a Demonstration
  Project category and a Master Plan category.    </p><p><strong>Demonstration Project
  Category:</strong>    For submissions in the Demonstration Project category,
  EPA is seeking proof-of-concept level designs that examine how green infrastructure
  could be integrated into a particular site on the teamís campus to meet multiple
  environmental, educational, and economic objectives. Entries in this category
  should include detailed information on the design and performance of the proposed
  demonstration project, and should reflect extensive consultation with the facilities
  planning department to assess project feasibility.    </p><p><strong>Master Plan Category:</strong>    For
  submissions in the Master Plan category, EPA is seeking conceptual designs that
  examine how green infrastructure could be integrated into a broad area of the
  teamís campus. Entries in this category should be coordinated with existing
  campus master plans and should describe how green infrastructure could be used
  to enhance the long-term sustainability of the campus.    </p><p><strong>†For Both
  Categories:</strong>    This year''s competition asks student teams to incorporate
  climate resiliency considerations into their stormwater management designs.
  For both submission categories, teams should examine and describe the current
  and/or potential impacts of climate change on their college or university communities.
  Entries should qualitatively and/or quantitatively demonstrate how the predicted
  performance of the teamís proposed green infrastructure project can mitigate
  and build resiliency to those impacts while effectively managing stormwater
  runoff (e.g., manage localized flooding, prepare for drought, reduce or eliminate
  irrigation, reduce urban heat impacts, lower energy demands).    </p><p><strong>Submission
  Requirements:</strong>    To compete in EPA''s Campus RainWorks Challenge, registered
  teams must submit the following which describe an innovative green infrastructure
  project for a location on their campus:  <ul>    <li>One (1) Project Narrative</li>    <li>Two
  (2) Design Boards, and</li>    <li>One (1) Letter of Support</li>  </ul>  Submissions
  should provide information of sufficient quality to enable the judges to evaluate
  the design. Submissions should describe the overall project goals, project context
  within the campus or watershed, existing conditions along with the problem to
  be solved, proposed green infrastructure approaches, and expected outcomes.    </p><p><strong>Project
  Narrative:</strong>  <ul>    <li>The intent of the Project Narrative is to provide
  a summary of each team''s approach to addressing the challenge criteria (see
  Judging section).</li>    <li>Each team must prepare a Project Narrative not
  exceeding ten (10) 8.5" x 11" pages (including images, graphics, and tables;
  excluding cover page, abstract, and references). Note that pages in excess of
  ten will not be reviewed. Pages should be consecutively numbered with 1" margins,
  and text should be single-spaced in standard 12-point font. Headings may be
  larger than 12-point font; text labels for graphics or images may be smaller
  than 12-point font; page numbers may be outside of the 1" margin.</li>    <li>The
  Project Narrative must include a cover page (including registration number,
  project title, first and last names and disciplines of team members, and name
  and discipline of faculty advisor) and a project abstract (250 word maximum).</li>    <li>Teams
  must provide 1 electronic copy of the Project Narrative in Adobe Acrobat PDF
  format. Instructions on submitting deliverables are provided below.</li>  </ul>  <strong>Two
  Design Boards</strong>  <ul>    <li>The intent of the Design Boards is to provide
  a visual explanation of the site context, design elements, and design performance.</li>    <li>The
  design boards must focus on visual elements and limit the amount of excess text.
  The design boards should supplement, not duplicate, graphics within the Project
  Narrative.</li>    <li>Each team must prepare two 24" x 36" design boards. Each
  board must include the teamís registration number (see Registration section)
  in the upper right hand corner.</li>    <li>The design boards must include a

  Support:</strong>  <ul>    <li>The intent of the letter of support is to demonstrate
  consultation with the college or university''s facilities planning department
  to develop a feasible design.</li>    <li>The letter of support does not count
  against the ten (10) page limit of the Project Narrative.</li>    <li>Each team
  must submit a letter from a member of the college or university''s facilities
  planning department demonstrating support for the proposed design. Letters of
  support are not to exceed two 8.5" by 11" pages. Note that pages in excess of

description: 'While single-purpose "gray" stormwater infrastructure (e.g., catch basins,
  pipes, and ponds) is largely designed to move urban stormwater away from the built
  environment, green infrastructure uses vegetation and soil to manage rainwater close
  to where it falls. By weaving natural processes into the built environment, green
  infrastructure can provide not only stormwater management, but also heat island
  mitigation, air quality management, community amenities, and much more.    EPA invites
  student teams to design an innovative green infrastructure project for their campus
  to show how managing stormwater at its source can benefit the campus community and
  the environment. Student teams can compete in one of two design categories: the
  Master Plan category or the Demonstration Project category. This year, EPA will
  ask student teams to incorporate climate resiliency considerations into their stormwater
  management designs. To compete in EPA''s Campus RainWorks Challenge, registered
  teams must submit†one Project Narrative, two Design Boards, and one Letter of Support
  describing an innovative green infrastructure project for a location on their campus.
  Winning teams will earn a student prize to be divided evenly among student team
  members, as well as a faculty prize to support green infrastructure research or
  training.'
