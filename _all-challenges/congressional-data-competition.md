rules: '<strong>Introduction</strong>    The Library of Congress sponsors this
  legislative data challenge to advance the discovery, use, and exploration of
  the collection of legislative information the Library offers to the nation and
  the world through the website Congress.gov.    Presented in cooperation with
  the United States Congress and the Government Publishing Office, Congress.gov
  offers the public a rich collection of documents about the legislative process
  of the United States, including bills and laws, Congressional rules, calendars
  and journals, and records of Congressional hearings and meetings.    <strong>The
  purpose of this challenge is to encourage the development of tools, methods,
  and materials that help American citizens and the rest of the world discover,

  exploration of the Congress.gov collection will benefit students of all ages,
  the business, scientific, and academic communities, historians, and anyone interested

description: '<strong>What new insights can come from Congressional data?</strong>    A
  variety of Congressional publications and data sets are available on Congress.gov.
  The Library of Congress (LC) invites you to leverage that data to create new meaning
  or tools to help members of Congress and the public explore it in new ways.    <strong>What
  are we looking for?</strong>    LC would like to inspire creative use of technology
  to analyze digital Congressional information from Congress.gov. This could take
  the form of interactive visualizations, mobile or desktop applications, a website,
  or other digital creation.    <strong>Submission Criteria</strong>    Final submission
  will include a 2-minute demonstration video explaining a product, the data sources
  used, and its benefits. Source code is required to be published and licensed as
  <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/">CC0.</a>    <strong>Prizes</strong>    LC
  will award $5,000 for first prize and $1,000 for the best high-school project. Honorable
  mentions may be awarded for:  <ul>    <li>Best tracking of legislative status</li>    <li>Best
  data visualization, and</li>    <li>Best data mashup</li>  </ul>  To get you thinking,
  we offer a few example projects:  <ul>    <li>A visualization of how the legislative
  process works using legislative data</li>    <li>Tools that could be embedded on
  Congressional and public websites</li>    <li>Legislative matching service, to identify
  Members with similar legislative interests</li>    <li>Tools to improve accessibility
  of legislative data, and</li>    <li>A tool that, based on bill text, identifies
  Members of Congress with legislative interests that are similar to the user’s, or
  to the legislative interests of other Members of Congress</li>  </ul>  Solvers may
  want to review the winners of the <a href="https://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2016-07-25">Chronicling
  America: Historic American Newspapers Data Challenge</a> for inspiration in how
  innovators of all ages have looked at data in different ways.    <strong>Acknowledgements</strong>    Thanks
