  of the HA-VTE Prevention Challenge will be asked to describe the VTE prevention
  strategy and reasons that support the strategy choice developed by their organization.
  In addition, entrants will be asked to describe the specific intervention(s) (e.g.
  implementation of VTE protocols and order sets, risk assessment, electronic alerts,
  clinical decision support tools, performance monitoring systems and dashboards,
  patient and/or provider education and awareness, post-discharge follow-up, etc.),
  methods, and systems used to implement, support and evaluate the strategy. Entrants
  will be asked to submit at least one quantitative measure showing an increase of
  VTE prevention (e.g. # of patients assessed for VTE risk, # of at risk patients
  receiving appropriate VTE prevention, # of patients and/or providers receiving education
  on VTE prevention, etc.) and/or decrease in HA-VTE rates for the organization’s
  population of interest. Each measure submitted must include two data points: one
  for the control or pre-intervention period and a second for the post-intervention
  period. Control/pre-intervention and post-intervention measures must cover a period
  of at least six months.    The VTE prevention rates achieved should be for the organizations
  entire patient population observed as outlined in their strategy and intervention
  methods, not limited to a sample. Data on subpopulations is allowed, but must be
  inclusive of all patients seen during the stated time period of study. Examples
  of ineligible data submissions include VTE prevention interventions limited to treatment
  cohorts from clinical trials of novel anticoagulant drugs.    The estimated burden

winner-solution-description-0: "The Champions range from a small community hospital
  to some of the country's largest health systems, and they represent both rural
  and urban areas. Together they cared for more than 450,000 patients admitted
  to hospitals across the United States in 2014. They were able to improve VTE
  prevention within their institutions and organizations by implementing innovative,
  effective and sustainable VTE prevention strategies, including these:\r\n•\tEngaging
  teams of different healthcare experts  to support and promote prevention activities;\r\n•\tInforming
  patients and providers about the need for and benefits of VTE prevention;\r\n•\tUsing
  technology (such as electronic risk assessment and clinical decision support
  tools and alerts) to ensure that all patients are assessed for their risk for
  VTE and bleeding. These tools also help ensure patients, when appropriate, are
  provided with and use appropriate prevention measures for their level of risk;
  and\r\n•\tProviding real-time feedback, scorecards and dashboards for providers
  and organizations to monitor performance and identify areas for improvement.\r\n\r\nCDC
  also recognized four organizations with honorable mentions for their innovative
  and unique approaches to prevention in special populations and settings. These
  include post-discharge monitoring, a unique ambulation program for psychiatric
  inpatients, an innovative prophylaxis-dosing protocol for level 1 trauma units,
  and an international submission on risk assessment for obstetric patients.\r\n"

  Problem:</strong>    Venous thromboembolism (VTE), blood clots occurring as deep
  vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), or both, is an important and growing
  public health issue. Prevention of healthcare-associated VTE (HA-VTE) is a national
  hospital safety priority. Many HA-VTEs can be prevented, but VTE prevention strategies
  are still not being applied regularly or effectively across the United States.    <br><strong>The
  Challenge:</strong>    To support and promote HA-VTE prevention, HHS and CDC announce
  the 2015 HA-VTE Prevention Challenge. The challenge will bring prestige to organizations
  that invest in VTE prevention, improve understanding of successful implementation
  strategies at the health system level, and motivate health systems to strengthen
  their VTE prevention efforts. The top-judged organizations found to have implemented
  innovative and effective VTE prevention strategies will be recognized as HA-VTE
  Prevention Champions. CDC will document these successful strategies and highlight
  the systems, processes, and staffing that contributed to exceptional VTE prevention
  outcomes achieved by Champions. Champions will receive a cash prize (if eligible)
  and other forms of recognition.    <br><strong>The Goal:</strong>    To identify hospitals,
  multi-hospital systems, hospital networks, and managed care organizations that have
  implemented an innovative and effective VTE prevention strategy using one or more
  interventions (e.g. VTE protocols and order sets, risk assessment, electronic alerts,
  clinical decision support tools, performance monitoring systems and dashboards,
  patient and/or provider education and awareness, post-discharge follow-up, etc.)
  designed to increase VTE prevention.    <br><strong>The Solution?</strong>    There
  is no one solution! We are looking for successful programs from all types of hospitals—small
  and large, urban and rural, academic, private, public, federal, and international.
  In short, we want to know what was successful in your setting!    Entrants of the
  HA-VTE Prevention Challenge will be asked to describe the VTE prevention strategy
  and the specific intervention(s) (e.g. implementation of VTE protocols and order
  sets, risk assessment, electronic alerts, clinical decision support tools, performance
  monitoring systems and dashboards, patient and/or provider education and awareness,
  post-discharge follow-up, etc.), methods, and systems used to implement, support
  and evaluate the strategy. Entrants will be asked to submit at least one quantitative
  measure showing an increase of VTE prevention (e.g. # of patients assessed for VTE
  risk, # of at risk patients receiving appropriate VTE prevention, # of patients
  and/or providers receiving education on VTE prevention, etc.) and/or decrease in
  HA-VTE rates for the organization’s population of interest.    <br><strong>The Prizes:</strong>    An
  estimated 7 of the highest scoring U.S. non-federal hospitals, multi-hospital systems,
  hospital networks and managed care organizations will be recognized as HA-VTE Prevention
  Champions and will receive a cash award of $10,000. A maximum of $70,000 will be
  awarded in this challenge. Additional honorable mention awards, pending availability
  of funds, may be made if the judges identify more than 7 deserving entries.    Winning
  submissions from U.S. Federal entities and international entities will be eligible
  for non-monetary recognition.    In addition, all Champions will be recognized by
  the CDC. Documentation of the clinical systems and strategies used by Champions
  to improve VTE prevention will be promoted and shared on the CDC website and attributed
  to Champions.    <br><strong>The Judging:</strong>    Challenge submissions will be
  evaluated by a panel of three to five judges from CDC and other HHS agencies using
  the information provided on, and in accordance with, the nomination form. The judges
  will score the nomination form using a rubric based on the following evaluation
  criteria: methods (30% of score); results (50% of score); and feasibility/utility
  (20% of score) of the strategy and interventions associated with the intended outcome
  of interest. Nominees with the highest score will be required to participate in
  a process to verify their data. Final selection will take into account all the information
  form the nomination form, the background check, and data verification. Geographic
  location and population treated may be used to break any ties in the event of tie
  scores at any point in the selection process. An estimated 7 organizations will
  be recognized as prize winners.    Some Champions will participate in a post-challenge
  telephone interview. The interview will include questions about the strategies employed
  by the organization to achieve high rates of VTE prevention, including barriers
  and facilitators for those strategies. The interview will focus on systems and processes
  and should not require preparation time by the Champion. The estimated time for
  the interview is one hour, which includes time to review the interview protocol
  with the interviewer, respond to the interview questions, and review a summary report
  about the Champion’s practices. The summary will be written as a success story and
  will be posted on the CDC website.    <br><strong>How to Enter:</strong>    Challenge
  launches <strong>Monday, November 2, 2015 @ 5:00 pm</strong>! <strong>To enter,
