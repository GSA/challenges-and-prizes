  Legacy aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) used by the Department of Defense
  (DoD) as a firefighting foam is facing increasing regulatory scrutiny
  throughout the world due to environmental and human health concerns associated
  with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS are persistent in the
  environment, and the DoD will be requiring PFAS-free firefighting agents in
  the near future. The DoD’s Strategic Environmental Research and Development
  Program (SERDP) and Environmental Security Technology Certification Program
  (ESTCP) are tasked with developing and demonstrating PFAS-free firefighting
  agents for use as a replacement for legacy AFFF.


  This challenge provides an opportunity for individuals and firms of various sizes to contribute to the development of an AFFF alternative by submitting innovative formulations that can approach and match the capabilities of legacy AFFF. The submitter will initially demonstrate these capabilities by performing a small pan fire extinguishing test as described later in this document and in the [supporting video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S2XEpmXMJw).


  #### Key Dates


  * Submission period begins: July 13, 2021 at 12:00 pm ET

  * Submission period ends: September 30 2021 at 2:00 pm ET
prizes: >-
  Multiple cash prizes up to $10,000 may be awarded


  Research and development funds may be awarded beyond the cash prize to successful submitters.
rules: >
  This challenge is inherently dangerous. If you do not have the correct
  protective equipment, test materials or facilities, DO NOT PROCEED.  Any
  submission that shows inadequate equipment or hazardous conditions, will be
  disqualified. In addition, SERDP assumes no responsibility for damage or
  injuries that may occur when performing this challenge.


  Any video showing unsafe practices will lead to disqualification.


  All submissions will be held in confidence in accordance with the Federal Trade Secrets Act (18 USC 1905). Submissions including Non-Disclosure Agreements will not be accepted.

  #### Judging Panel


  A panel of U.S. Government subject matter experts will serve as judges for this challenge.


  #### Judging Criteria


  Judging criteria are based on physical properties of the foam, fire performance characteristics, and potential environmental impacts.  More information is provided within the [guidance document](<https://www.serdp-estcp.org/content/download/53783/528370/file/AFFF Challenge Guidance.pdf>).
