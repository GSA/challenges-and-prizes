description: In remote sensing the highest spatial resolution images are panchromatic
  grey scale images. Unfortunately the lack of color makes the images less useful
  and can hinder or prevent an accurate assessment of the information contained within
  the image. This may be made even more problematic if an imaged area contains fleeting
  activity and there is insufficient time to obtain color imagery of the area. The
  Seeker desires demonstration of a method to rapidly and accurately colorize a panchromatic
  image to aid in the analysis of such images under these circumstances. This goes
  well beyond simple colorization of an old black and white image in terms of the
  size of the image and the speed at which the colorization must be accomplished.
  Panchromatic images of interest typically run to the tens or hundreds of thousands
  of pixels square and can be upward of ten gigabytes in size and must be computed
  in a matter of hours.
