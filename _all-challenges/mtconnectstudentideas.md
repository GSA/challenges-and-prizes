description: '<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">UPDATE: Based on
  multiple requests from both professors and students, the submission deadline for
  this competition has been EXTENDED to March 15, 2016. Winners will be announced
  by March 23, 2016. Ideation winners will be invited to attend the <a href="http://mc2conference.com"
  target="_blank">[MC]2 Conference</a>, a digital manufacturing conference taking
  place in Dallas on April 19-21, 2016.</span></p>    <p>The next Industrial Revolution
  is happening <em>now</em>, and this is your opportunity to change its trajectory
  forever! Your participation in this challenge could directly affect the advancement
  of an entire industry, and subsequently our nation’s economic growth. Sounds daunting?
  We promise it isn’t. There is just a five page paper standing between you and big
  opportunities that will allow you to transform your future while transforming an
  industry. Not only are there incredible opportunities and cash prizes on the line
  (upwards of $10,500!), but the challenge could also serve as an impressive thesis,
  capstone or finals project. You have to do these projects for class anyway, you
  might as well make your mark on history while you’re at it!</p><p>Your challenge is
  to brainstorm and develop innovative and adaptable manufacturing intelligence, drawing
  from data acquired using the MTConnect standard. MTConnect is an open, XML- and
  HTTP-based communications standard that acts as the enabler for the Internet of
  Things for manufacturing by fostering improved connectivity and interoperability
  between manufacturing equipment and devices. Within the challenge itself— there
  are two separate competitions, and you can choose to participate in one or both.</p> 
  <p>#1— Idea
  Creation: You must identify a manufacturing intelligence need, and build a business
  case for your proposed solution. Your solution must be written out, and including
  a cover page and 200 word abstract, <em>may not exceed five pages</em>.</p>  <p>#2— Applications:
