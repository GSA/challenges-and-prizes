  technical alignment to the Next Generation First Responder Apex program, relevance
  to the DHS mission, and potential integration with existing projects.  <p></p>  The
  three use cases, listed under (1) below, apply to this competition and, at a
  minimum; at least two of these must be addressed. The judging panel will use
  the following criteria and rating scales for evaluating proposed solutions with
  high scores reflecting the most highly rated solutions: (Maximum 100 points;
  plus up to 50 bonus points)  <p></p>  (1)     Building structure (0-30 points) -    (i)        
  Case 1 – Should be able to track multiple first responders inside of a 2-story
  residential structure above and below grade;    (ii)       Case 2 – Should be
  able to track multiple first responders inside of a warehouse structure with
  a minimal footprint of 20,000 square feet;    (iii)     Case 3 – Should be able
  to track multiple first responders inside of a multi-storied commercial building
  above grade and below grade.  <p></p>  (2)     Location Accuracy (0-50 points) - Location
  capability should provide 3-dimentional positioning where X is less than or
  equal to 3 meters with a position error of less than equal to +/- 0.50 meters;
  where Y is less than or equal to 3 meters with a position error of less than
  equal to +/- 0.50 meters; and where Z is less than or equal to 2 meters with
  a position error of less than equal to +/- 0.25 meters.  <p></p>  (3)     Real-time
  reporting (0-10 points) - The solution should be able to provide real-time reporting
  of +/- 15 seconds to the on-scene commander and must be able to transmit, omni-directional,
  position location no less than 1500 feet from within the structure.  <p></p>  (4)    
  The modular form should be man-portable and weigh less than 5 pounds (0 – 10
  points).  <ul>   <li>Bonus Points (Maximum 50 bonus points) -</li>  </ul>  (i)        
  Feasibility (Bonus worth up to 30 points) - Solvers should provide sufficient
  details to support the feasibility that the proposed solution can be demonstrated
  with further research and development in less than two years, including published
  or unpublished data, scientific basis, technological capability, and resources.   <br> (ii)      
  Adaptability (Bonus worth up to 20 points) - Must describe broad utility and
  scalability. The approach should lend itself to more than one first responder
  discipline, such as law enforcement, firefighting, and emergency medical services.</p>'

winner-solution-description-0: The first place winning solution was submitted
  by Thomas Vreeland on behalf of the Vreeland Institute located in Copake, NY.  The
  proposal consists of a combination of existing technologies for determining
  an individual’s location.  When combined together the technologies are capable
  of building a three dimensional awareness of the operational environment, the
  building’s interior, and a responder’s location in real time. The First Responder
  Indoor Tracking System (FRITS) solution provides a new approach consisting of
  MEMS sensors, dead reckoning, altimeter sensor, LIDAR odometry , sensor fusion,
  auxiliary sensor mapping, 3D world building, crowdsourced navigation, filtering
  techniques, augmented reality, and heat maps. The Vreeland Institute received
  a $20,000 cash prize for its first place submission.

winner-solution-description-1: 'The second place winning solution was submitted
  on behalf of Certa Cito, LLC of Rochester, NY by its founder and co-founder
  Susan and Andrew Sheppard.  In their proposal, they offer a solution to a tracking
  system currently under development called JUNOTM. JUNOTM is a context-spatial
  awareness system that incorporates an existing tracking and localization system,
  a Wireless Ad hoc System for Positioning (WASP), and supports context driven
  spatial awareness. The solution provides an overview of WASP capabilities and
  then explains the components of the JUNOTM system. The solver discussed each
  building structure case with detailed solution requirements and an overview
  of how JUNOTM would operate in each case.  Certa Cito also provided an overview
  of the recommended research, development and testing path required to execute
  the JUNOTM technology and a timeframe for development. Certa Cito, LLC received
  a $5,000 cash prize for its second place submission.. '

description: <p>The Department of Homeland Security,  Science and Technology Directorate
  (DHS S&amp;T) First Responders Group (FRG) is seeking innovative methods for real-time,
  robust indoor tracking of the next generation first responder. The development of
  sensors and communications able to perform well across a variety of indoor environments
  is one of the biggest challenges in first responder tracking research and development.
  This prize competition seeks personalized, modular and scalable approaches to track
  the next generation of first responders indoors using current and emerging technologies,
  sensors, and techniques. Submissions should consist of a concept/design for a low
  cost, robust, real-time indoor tracking capability. <p></p>   The ability to use Global
  Positioning System (GPS) technology is extremely limited for indoor tracking capabilities
  due to its weak signal strength and inability to penetrate buildings. There are
  limited alternatives to GPS, such as wave measurements, magnetic fields, sonar/acoustics,
  mobile devices, etc. Each alternative has benefits and limitations and offers varying
  levels of tracking capabilities. This competition seeks innovative solutions that
  can help track next generation first responders while they are inside of a structure
  without having to set up prepositioned towers or other devices. The building structure
  may be concrete, steel, glass or any combination of modern building materials and
  of varying heights. Ideally, a solution will be wearable; self-reporting to provide
  real-time x, y, z positioning; and mission-agnostic thereby allowing for use by
  any first responder discipline (e.g., law enforcement, firefighting, emergency medical
  services, and emergency management).</p>
