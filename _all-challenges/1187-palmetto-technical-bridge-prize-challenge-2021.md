  The NIWC Atlantic Palmetto Tech Prize Challenge is seeking submissions for the
  following two topics. This prize challenge is under 10 USC § 2374a and is
  considered an independent effort.  However, the results of this prize
  challenge may result in an additional follow-on acquisition opportunity.


  **Topic 1: Robotic Process Automation (RPA)**

  Creating, managing, and sustaining our command’s data resources and repositories is a daily requirement for our business operation competencies (Finance, Contracts, HR, Supply Chain, etc).  Most of this work is extremely manual in nature with standard business practices and rules that Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solutions should be able to accommodate.  RPA will allow us to move our employees away from these manually intensive tasks to more high-value work. 


  In Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20), NIWC Atlantic began developing attended bots for a few of our competencies as proof of concepts/pilots to show the value RPA can provide to our command.  NIWC Atlantic utilized the RPA Playbook developed by the Federal RPA community of practice to align with the desktop model approach.  While these attended bots have demonstrated the value automation can provide to the command, they are constrained to individual users and their computer assets being dedicated to execute.  NIWC Atlantic conducts most of our business operations through Department of Defense (DoD) approved networks and tools which require DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) credentials to access and operate.  Our attended bots require a user to initiate and leave their DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with PKI credentials inside their computer as the bots require those to operate within our network and tools.  While the bots are running, users are unable to utilize their computer or CAC for other work that needs to be executed.


  NIWC Atlantic is seeking RPA expertise to understand Enterprise RPA solutions that provide unattended bots that can be scheduled or triggered based on input received.  An unattended, Enterprise RPA solution will allow NIWC Atlantic to achieve the true value RPA provides, enabling us to focus our human capital towards more analytical, innovative, and meaningful work.  The unattended RPA solution would require DoD PKI credentials to operate within our environments and will need to be able to operate on the Navy Marine Corp Intranet (NMCI) network where all of our work is executed.  The NMCI network is a DoD approved network with stringent security requirements and software application approvals that will need to be factored into potential solutions.


  **Topic 2: Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT)**

  The Marine Corps seeks an alternative strategy to provide Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) inputs in environments where input may not be available or not as reliable from the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) constellation. Any viable alternative must operate under conditions where radio frequency PNT signals are temporarily or permanently denied, degraded, or unreliable. Ability to overcome additional constraints of the operating environment (such as environments indoors, underground, or where radio frequency signals cannot be received) is also of value. Ideal solutions should be able to support diverse use cases in support of small, mobile systems, including dismounted Marines using an alternative PNT data input to locate and track oneself, and others (by feeding such input into a network). Use cases include individuals/units navigating within a building or across large geographic areas, and using alternative PNT data input to locate and track individuals, small unmanned surface, subsurface, or air vehicles.


  **The Challenge will go through a two-stage judging process.** 


  * ***Stage 1: Initial Submissions.*** Submissions will be judged by panel members with resident knowledge of the subject.  Judging panel members will evaluate each submission based on the criteria outlined in the judging criteria below.  Each topic will be evaluated separately and independently from one another.  The goal of Stage 1 for the evaluators is to select five (5) participants and one (1) alternate to present oral presentations at the CDCA Summit on March 3, 2021.  In the event that one of the first five (5) participants selected for oral presentations cannot attend the CDCA Summit, the alternate’s participant will be contacted for interest in presenting an oral presentation. 

  * ***Stage 2: Oral Presentations at the CDCA Summit.*** The top five (5) participants for each technology category will be invited to present, at their own cost, the technology topic associated with their initial submission.   The oral presentation will be conducted with the Government evaluators and other government representatives interested in the exchange.  The audience could be made up of both CDCA Conference attendees and government representatives.  If the Presenter wishes to have only government representatives in attendance, the participant will need to notify the organizer of this prize challenge in advance of the presentation.  The oral presentation should be limited to a not to exceed 30 minute period followed by approximately 20 minutes of questions and answers. Only the government evaluators will ask questions. At the conclusion of all oral presentations, the Government judging panel team will privately discuss the oral presentations to determine the Prize Challenge winner and a runner up.


  The Prize Challenge Winner for each topic will be announced on the third day of the CDCA Summit, 5 March, 2021.  Each topic will present a Prize of $10,000 and also an Honorable Mention for the runner up.


  Prizes will be distributed to the eligible winners via electronic funds transfer (EFT), within 90 business days of the announcement of the winner(s).  NIWC Atlantic will distribute the funds evenly to all team members. Eligibility to receive an award is based upon the participant’s adherence to all rules for this Challenge. Funding for this Challenge will come from both overhead and direct funding.


  1. If the Prize Challenge winners have previously done business with the US Government and have a CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code.  The winner will be able to provide that information to the contest organizers.  The contest organizers will use it to complete the SF 1034, public voucher other than personnel.   The winner will then submit the completed voucher to vendor pay.  Vendor pay would then certify the payment.

  2. If the winners do not already have a CAGE code, they need go to the System for Award Management (SAM) URL <https://www.sam.gov/SAM/>.   The winner will then create an account and register their business.  Once they do that they will be assigned a CAGE code.  Once they have the CAGE code, they would give the CAGE code to the contest organizers, who would use it to complete the SF 1034.

### Judging Criteria

**Judging Panel**

Submissions that comply with the challenge requirements will be reviewed by a panel of judges consisting of Government Representatives. Entries will be scored by a panel of judges with a resident knowledge of the Technology Challenge topic.  One Judging Panel will be assigned per Challenge Topic and will judge only the topic in which they are assigned.

**Judging Criteria**

Each submission will be judged based on the following criteria with each judge panel independently scoring the solution on a scale of 1-5 and then calculated into a weighted percentage as detailed below. A score of “1” indicates that the submission received the lowest consideration based on the scoring criteria below whereas a score of “5” would indicate that the submission is considered the highest of interest to the Government. The winner will be determined by averaging all judges’ scores and calculating the highest scoring solution.

**Stage 1 Judging Considerations:**

***Technical Approach (1/3rd of scoring)***

* The solution provides a novel approach to the Challenge topic in accordance with one or both of the following:

  * The technology approach provides a new approach using existing commercial application not commonly found within the Department of the Navy
  * The technology approach provides a new concept not widely used within a commercial application.
  * The description of the technology approach provides a comprehensive description with supportive data, methods, and supportive technologies used towards a solution.
  * The description of the technical approach is written in a manner that is legible and easy to read.
