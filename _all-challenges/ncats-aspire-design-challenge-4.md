  4. Biological Assays for Translational Innovation in Pain, Opioid Use Disorder
  and Overdose.</strong>&nbsp;This Challenge aims to address the need for novel,
  physiologically relevant biological assays that accurately replicate the safety
  profile and effectiveness of existing drugs and that can be reliably used in
  predictive risk assessments of new analgesics or drugs to treat addiction and/or
  overdose to molecular signature(s) and/or be able to anticipate the degree of
  addictiveness of an analgesic prior to clinical testing. This Challenge requires
  submission of only a detailed description of the design of the assay(s), not
  the final working assay(s).</p>\r\n<p>The goal of this Challenge is to reward
  and spur innovative solutions to the development of a novel physiologically
  relevant biological assay to advance pre-clinical discovery and development
  of non-addictive treatments for pain, drug addiction or overdoses. Current&nbsp;<em>in
  vitro</em>&nbsp;assays and&nbsp;<em>in vivo</em>&nbsp;models to study pain and
  addiction and test potential treatments are very limited. Pharmacological probe,
  lead and drug development have traditionally utilized canonical cell lines (such
  as CHO or HEK293) that heterologously express the molecular target of interest,
  and studies that are performed in animal models often do not fully recapitulate
  human physiology and may identify candidate compounds without effects in more
  human physiology-relevant systems. Therefore, NCATS is inviting innovators to
  propose and develop novel &ldquo;disease-in-a-dish&rdquo; assays of pain perception,
  addiction or overdose that advance the understanding of different types of pain,
  identify differences in inter- and intra-individual pain and the associated
  risk of developing chronic pain and/or addiction and make possible the development
  of improved, non-addictive drugs to treat these conditions. 2D and 3D human
  disease-relevant screening platforms may include but are not limited to normal
  and diseased human iPSC-derived sensory/pain neurons (such as peripheral, dorsal
  root ganglia [DRG], spinal cord, thalamus); neurons relevant to reward pathways;
  and other tissues important for pain, addiction and overdose, including blood-brain
  barrier (BBB). The assays will be adjudicated on their physiological relevance,
  robustness and reproducibility, and their future potential to be amended to
  automation and scalability for medium to high-throughput screening assays.</p>\r\n<p>Initially,
  the assay can be designed for low-throughput screening; it is expected that
  even at low throughput, multiple technical replicates will be compared in the
  same experiment. Eventually, the assay should be amenable to automation and
  scalable to medium- (96-well plate) to high-throughput screening (using, for
  example, high-content imaging, drug validation/toxicity, functional genomic
  screening).</p>\r\n<p>The innovators are encouraged to consult&nbsp;<a title=\"Assay
  Guidance Manual\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53196/\" target=\"_blank\"
  rel=\"noopener\">NCATS&rsquo; Assay Guidance Manual</a>&nbsp;(link is external)
  to learn more about appropriate designing of a drug screening assay.</p>\r\n<p>For
  the envisioned Reduction-to-Practice phase, the innovators will be expected
  to demonstrate the viability rate of cells in 2D or 3D models, at a particular
  throughput (90% viable), and provide data indicating how the functional morphological
  features are maintained in the system over time.</p>\r\n<h4>Judging criteria:</h4>\r\n<h4>Evaluation

  tab.</p>\r\n<p>For complete details on the challenge, <a href=\"https://ncats.nih.gov/aspire/challenges/challenge4\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">visit the NCATS ASPIRE Design Challenge 4 details
  page</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>About NCATS ASPIRE Design Challenges</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The
  National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), part of the National
  Institutes of Health (NIH) is inviting novel design solutions for A Specialized
  Platform for Innovative Research Exploration (<strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong>) Challenges
  as part of the <strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong> Program. The goal of the <strong>NCATS
  ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges is to reward and spur innovative and catalytic
  approaches towards solving the opioid crisis through development of: (1) novel chemistries;
  (2) data-mining and analysis tools and technologies; and (3) biological assays that
  will revolutionize discovery, development and pre-clinical testing of next generation,
  safer and non-addictive analgesics to treat pain, as well as new treatments for
  opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose. The first phase of these prize competitions
  is implemented through a suite of concurrent companion design challenges that comprises
  a separate challenge for each of four areas: chemistry database, electronic laboratory
  knowledge portal for synthetic chemistry, algorithms, and biological assays; and
  an additional challenge for a combined solution to at least two Challenge areas.
  At this stage, innovators are expected to submit designs, not final products or
  prototypes. NCATS envisions following these design challenges with a follow-on,
  but distinct, final reduction-to-practice challenge, which will aim to invoke further
  scientific and technological development of the model system. Winners of the design
  challenges will be invited to present their designs so that, in the envisioned follow-up
  Reduction-to-Practice Challenge, an open competition, teams will be able to form
  multi-disciplinary collaborations to advance and integrate the most feasible and
  promising approaches to the multiple challenges into a single integrative platform.
  Innovators will be invited to demonstrate final solutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>NCATS
  ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges are part of the of the NIH&rsquo;s Helping to
  End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national
  opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative will bolster research across
  NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain
  management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at: &nbsp;<a
  href=\"https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative.\">https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative.</a></p>\r\n<p>NCATS
  refers to participants in the <strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges as
  &ldquo;innovators&rdquo; because all solutions will require highly innovative approaches
  to achieve success. &nbsp;Innovators should clearly state how and why the proposed
  solution would provide significant advances over currently available tools. Innovators
  may choose to compete in one or more individual challenges to address a single area
  (Challenges 1-4) or propose a combined solution for at least two Challenge areas
  (Challenge 5).<p>For further information send an
