description: "<strong>The goals of this Challenge are viable materials that will result
  in increased safety and protection for athletes, the warfighter, and civilians.
   </strong>The NFL, Under Armour, GE and NIST have established a joint effort to
  advance the state-of-the-art in advanced materials for impact mitigation. We seek
  to stimulate the development of a range of materials that provide excellent energy
  absorbing and energy dissipating properties.  Materials submitted to the Challenge
  can be from a variety of classes, <strong>which may include, but are not limited
  to</strong>:  <ul>   <li>Aerogels</li>   <li>Field-Affected materials</li>   <li>Filamentous
  materials</li>   <li>Foams</li>   <li>Lattice materials</li>   <li>Low weight materials</li>
  \  <li>Non-Newtonian materials</li>   <li>Smart materials</li>   <li>Other types
  of materials</li>  </ul>  Head Health Challenge III is a call for novel materials
  that maximize energy absorption and minimize momentum transfer. If invited to submit
  a sample, a material must, at a minimum meet the following criteria: (1) Withstand
  a force range of 3-12kN; (2) Have the potential for withstanding 1200 impacts above
  20 KE (J); (3) Perform in the impact velocity range of 3.4 m/s to 11.2 m/s; and
  (4) Maintain performance in the temperature range of -30C to 40C and humidity range
  of 40% to 100%.    If your material meets the performance criteria above and you
  would like to participate in this challenge, you will be required to complete an
  abstract template.  <ol>   <li><strong>A brief non-confidential description of the
  proposed material </strong>and why it is novel with respect to its proposed application
  for impact protection.</li>   <li><strong>A submission of preliminary test data</strong>
  supported by an explanation of the data relevance and the data collection methods
  for the material. (NOTE: This should be submitted through the submit page on the
  Challenge Website)</li>   <li><strong>An explanation of the </strong>technology
  readiness level of your material.</li>   <li><strong>The Intellectual Property status
  </strong>of the material.</li>   <li><strong>The expertise and capabilities</strong>
  of the applicant team.</li>  </ol>  If you are invited to advance in the challenge,
  you will be notified by email and given instructions to submit a more detailed proposal,
  along with samples of your material for potential testing. A panel of judges with
  select up to six awardees to receive Round 1 Awards. Over the course of a year,
  the six awardees will further develop their materials over the course of a year.
  At the conclusion of that year a panel of judges will select a Grand Prize Winner.
