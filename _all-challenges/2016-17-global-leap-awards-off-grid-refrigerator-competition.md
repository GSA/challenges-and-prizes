  Description.</strong></li>  </ol>  <strong> </strong>    The Global Lighting
  and Energy Access Partnership (“Global LEAP”) Outstanding Off-Grid Appliance
  Awards Competition &amp; Innovation Prize (individually, the “Competition” and
  “Innovation Prize”; collectively, the “Global LEAP Awards”) seeks to transform
  the global market for off-grid appliances by recognizing and rewarding the most
  energy-efficient, highest quality off-grid refrigerator products. As a Clean
  Energy Ministerial initiative, Global LEAP seeks to advance global clean energy
  access policy goals by harnessing the power of marketplace competition to drive
  technical and market innovations in the off-grid appliance sector. The inaugural
  Global LEAP Awards were announced in May 2014 at the 5th Clean Energy Ministerial
  in Seoul, Korea, and featured off-grid LED luminaires and televisions. The second
  Global LEAP Awards were announced in June 2016 at the 7th Clean Energy Ministerial
  in San Francisco, USA, and featured off-grid televisions and fans.    &nbsp;    This
  Global LEAP Awards Competition will focus on super-efficient off-grid refrigerators,
  and will recognize commercially-available products that demonstrate a strong
  balance of energy efficiency, quality, affordability, and off-grid appropriateness.
  The Innovation Prize, a component of the Competition, consists of a cash reward
  that will be awarded to up to three (3) commercially-available OR late-stage
  prototype products that demonstrate market-leading technical and/or design innovation.    &nbsp;    The
  Collaborative Labeling and Appliance Standards Program (“CLASP”) serves as the
  “Awards Operating Agent” and “Administrator” for the Global LEAP Awards. The
  Global LEAP Awards Off-Grid Refrigerator Competition is supported by USAID’s
  Global Development Lab as part of the Scaling Off-Grid Energy: A Grand Challenge
  for Development initiative, the U.K. Department for International Development’s
  Ideas to Impact Programme, Power Africa’s Beyond the Grid initiative, and the
  U.S. Department of Energy.    &nbsp;    <strong> </strong>    <strong><u>RULES

  discretion.  <ol>    <li><u>Field Testing. </u></li>  </ol>  &nbsp;    All Products
  that satisfactorily complete laboratory testing will undergo field testing to
  evaluate Products’ design and technical performance in a real-world setting.    &nbsp;    Products
  will be evaluated based on a selection of the factors listed in the Laboratory
  Testing section above, as well as additional user-oriented factors, including:    &nbsp;  <ul>    <li>Impact
  of Product (e.g., new revenue generated by selling chilled beverages)</li>    <li>Perceived
  Value</li>    <li>Usability</li>  </ul>  &nbsp;    Field testing will be coordinated
  by Ideas to Impact, and is expected to take place in Uganda. Field testing may
  be subject to additional terms and conditions, as determined by Ideas to Impact.
  The Administrator will provide further information about this process as it
  becomes available.    &nbsp;  <ol>    <li><u>Winner Selection Process</u>. Preliminary
  Finalists Products will be awarded up to 100 points by means of two parallel
  assessments.</li>  </ol>  <ol>    <li>Competition</li>  </ol>  The Competition’s
  Preliminary Finalists will be awarded up to 100 points based on the following:  <ol>    <li>“<u>Laboratory
  Testing”</u>: Testing of Product’s power consumption and cooling performance,
  and certain design and quality factors, will be conducted according to the Global
  LEAP Off-Grid Refrigerator Test Method, a method developed referencing internationally-accepted
  test standards. Referenced test methods include IEC 62552 (Household refrigerating
  appliances – Characteristics and test methods) and WHO/PQS/E003/RF05-VP.4 (Refrigerator
  or combined refrigerator and water-pack freezer: Solar direct drive without
  battery storage).</li>  </ol>  &nbsp;  <ol>    <li>“<u>Expert Assessment”</u>:
  The Expert Panel will evaluate quality, design and usability factors (e.g. options
  and functionality, look and feel of Product, packaging and instructions), based
  on data provided in the nominations and gathered through Laboratory Testing
  and Field Testing. The panel of Expert Judges will include technical, development,
  and off-grid industry and market experts, and may include representatives from
  the donor agencies supporting the Competition (e.g. USAID, U.S. Department of
  Energy). Expert Judges will not have personal or financial interests in, or
  be an employee, officer, director, or agent of any entity that is participating
  in the competition.</li>  </ol>  &nbsp;  <ol>    <li><u>Selection of Winners</u>.
  Winners of the Competition (“Competition Winners”) will be identified in the
  following way by the Administrator awarding up to 80 points based on a formulaic
  assessment of “total cost of ownership” (which is based on Laboratory Testing
  results of power consumption and standardized Global LEAP Awards assumptions
  about retail price, $/kWh, Product lifetime, and usage) and performance (which
  is based upon the products’ (i) time to cool a standardized load to a steady
  state and (ii) time holding a band of acceptable temperature once power has
  been disconnected).</li>  </ol>  &nbsp;    The formulaic assessment shall be
  Total Cost of Ownership (Product energy consumption*standardized lifetime usage
  assumptions [kWh]*$/kWh) + (wholesale price*standardized retail price modifier))
  <strong>x</strong> Time to Cool to Steady State Modifier (where less time is
  better) <strong>x</strong> Time Holding Acceptable Temperature Band Modifier
  (where more time is better) = $XXX. In this assessment, Preliminary Finalists
  with a lower total dollar figure will receive a higher score. This calculation
  will be used only for the purposes of judging the Global LEAP Awards, and its
  results will not be shared    &nbsp;    The remaining 20 points will be awarded
  based on the Expert Assessment of the Expert Panel. A Finalist may earn two
  (2) points of “extra credit” for each year of its warranty beyond the required

  must provide a copy of the warranty in English. Finalists using exclusively
  natural refrigerants will receive three (3) points of “extra credit”.    &nbsp;    The
  Product in each Category that earns the most points will be declared the “Winner”
  of its Category, and all other high-performing Products will be declared “Finalists.”
  The Administrator reserves the right to exclude from all Competition promotions
  any Preliminary Finalist that fails or performs poorly in the Laboratory Testing,
  Field Testing and/or Expert Assessment.    &nbsp;    Commercially-available
  products that badly violate “truth in advertising” norms (e.g. specified or
  claimed performance significantly overstates actual performance) may also be
  excluded from the program. Prototypes will not be held to the same “truth in
  advertising” standard.  Product test results will be delivered to the Nominator
  on a confidential basis.    &nbsp;  <ol start="2">    <li><u>Innovation Prize</u>.
  “Innovation Prize Winners” will be those Products that clearly demonstrate market-leading
  innovation, as identified by the Expert Panel based on the data and observations
  made during the Competition Laboratory Testing and Field Testing processes outlined
  above. Up to three (3) Innovation Prizes may be awarded pending the demonstration
  of market-leading innovation. Products may be eligible for more than one Innovation
  Prize. One (1) Innovation Prize is expected to be awarded for each for following
  product characteristics:</li>  </ol>  <ul>    <li>Energy Efficiency based on
  Laboratory Testing</li>    <li>Appropriate Design &amp; User Experience based
  on Field Testing</li>    <li>Overall Value based on Laboratory Testing</li>  </ul>  For
  the purposes of this program, “Overall Value” refers to the total score as determined
  by the Laboratory Testing and Expert Assessment process outlined herein. The
  Winner of the Innovation Prize for Overall Value will be that Product with the
  highest total score across all competition Categories.    &nbsp;  <ol start="7">    <li><strong>
  Awards</strong>.</li>  </ol>  &nbsp;  <ol>    <li><u>Competition Winners and

  Winners will be selected, with one Winner in each Product Category. All Preliminary
  Finalists that get invited for testing post-nomination, after the initial Expert
  Assessment and pass through testing and final expert evaluation successfully
  shall be referred to as “Finalists.”</li>    <li><u>Innovation Prize Winners</u>.
  Up to three (3) Innovation Prize Winners will receive a $200,000 cash prize,
  paid by USAID’s Global Development Lab and Ideas to Impact. Funding for these
  innovation incentive prizes have been appropriated pursuant to title III of
  the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Pub. L. No. 114-113 (2016). Recipients
  of an Innovation Prize will be required to sign the Ideas to Impact Counter
  Terrorism Anti-Corruption and Anti-Slavery Declaration.</li>    <li><u>All Global
  LEAP Award Winners and Finalists.</u> A Global LEAP-sponsored communications
  campaign will be launched in conjunction with the awards to publicize the Winners
  and Finalists in the Competition and Innovation Prize, and raise consumer awareness
  about high-quality and energy-efficient off-grid refrigeration. Among other
  efforts, Global LEAP will distribute information about Winners and Preliminary
  Finalists to off-grid industry leaders and procurement officials.</li>    <li><u>Commercially-Available
  Winners and Finalists.</u> Commercially-available Winners and Preliminary Finalists
  will be eligible to benefit from an affiliated Global LEAP program focused on

  and Nominees agree not to challenge or seek to register any intellectual property
  associated with the Global LEAP Awards, Competition or Innovation Prize.  Winners
  will be granted a limited personal license to use the Global LEAP Awards IP
  to advertise and promote the award granted to the specific model of their Product
  for one year from the date of award.  All use of the Global LEAP Awards IP must

  Winners and Finalist may only promote that an award pertains to the specific
  Product model winning an award, and may not state or imply that the award applies
  to other Product models of a Winner or Finalist.  Winners and Finalists may
  not use the Global LEAP Awards IP to state or imply that the Administrator or
  any other entity or person associated with the Competition endorse or are affiliated
  with the Winner or its Products.    &nbsp;  <ol start="9">    <li><strong> Publicity.

  purposes for the Global LEAP program and the Competition in all forms of media
  now known or hereafter discovered or devised, worldwide, in perpetuity, without

  each Nominator and Nominee waives any right to claim ambiguity in these Official
  Rules. A Nominee is not a Winner or Finalist until it has fully complied with
  these Official Rules. The Administrator reserves the right, in its sole and
  absolute discretion, to cancel, terminate, modify, extend, or suspend the Global
  LEAP Awards (in whole or in part) should non-authorized intervention, fraud,
  or other causes corrupt or affect the administration, security, fairness, or
  proper conduct of the Global LEAP Awards. In such case, the Administrator may
  name Winners from all eligible nominations received for the Global LEAP Awards
  prior to and/or after (if appropriate) the action taken by Administrator or
  via some other means determined by Administrator in its sole and absolute discretion
  to be fair, appropriate and consistent with these Official Rules.  Awards may
  not be given if in the Administrator’s sole discretion, an insufficient number
  of nominations were received in a Category. In its sole discretion, the Administrator
  may award more than one Winner in a Category. The Administrator anticipates
  that all Winners will be announced in August 2017. The Administrator reserves
  the right to exclude from all Competition promotions any finalist Product that
  fails or performs poorly in the Laboratory Testing and/or Expert Assessment.

  in violation of these Official Rules.  In such event, the Administrator reserves
  the right (in addition to disqualification of such Nominee) to seek damages
  from any such Nominee to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Administrator’s
  failure to enforce any provision of these Official Rules shall not constitute
  a waiver of that provision. Any entity that enters the Global LEAP Awards through
  means not permitted by these Official Rules is subject to disqualification.

  household members, spend shopping for or gathering food. But the market for off-grid
  refrigeration products is nascent and the prevalence of refrigerators in developing
  countries, particularly in rural areas, remains extremely low. Highly energy-efficient,
  appropriately designed and priced refrigerators are essential to this market’s development
  and to its subsequent positive development impacts.    The off-grid household and
  small business refrigeration market could quickly become a major commercial opportunity.
  By 2020, the market could see 38% year-over- year growth and total annual spending
  approaching $1.1 billion. In order to be viable in off-grid settings and suitable
  for off-grid customers, however, refrigerators must be considerably smaller, cheaper,
  and run on far less energy than most conventional products. Few refrigerators available
  today can satisfy the needs of the off-grid market. Increasing the availability
  of appropriate off-grid refrigerators at affordable prices will increase demand
  for off-grid solar solutions such as solar home systems and mini-grids.    The Global
  LEAP Awards competition will recognize best-in-class off-grid refrigerators, and
  offer cash prizes to recognize and incentivize innovation in off-grid refrigeration
  technology and design. All nominated products will be evaluated for their energy
  performance, quality, design and reliability according to rigorous international
  best practice.
