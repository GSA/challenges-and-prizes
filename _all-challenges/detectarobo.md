  field-wrapper">    The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) announces an open source
  prize competition that challenges the public to analyze data from a robocall
  honeypot, thus improving honeypot design. A honeypot is an information system
  that is designed to attract perpetrators of illegal acts—in this case robocallers—and
  gain knowledge about their tactics. The Contest will be held during the National
  Day of Civic Hacking, from June 6-7, 2015.  <h3>DATES:</h3>  Contestants may
  register beginning at 9:00 am Eastern Daylight Time (“EDT”) on June 6, 2015.
  Further instructions and requirements regarding registration and submission
  will be provided on the Contest Website (ftc.gov/detectarobo). The deadline
  for submitting entries is June 7, 2015, at 8:00 pm EDT.  <h3>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION
  CONTACT:</h3>  Patricia Hsue, 202-326-3132, Division of Marketing Practices,
  Bureau of Consumer Protection, FTC; 600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW; Mailstop CC-8528;
  Washington, DC 20580.  <h3>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</h3>  The FTC DetectaRobo
  Contest (the “Contest”) is the next step in the Federal Trade Commission’s battle
  against illegal robocalls, and complements the results of the FTC’s two prior
  robocall challenges in 2012 and 2014. Robocalls are prerecorded messages that
  generally seek to promote the purchase of goods or services to a consumer, and
  are regulated by the FTC under the Telemarketing Sales Rule. See 16 CFR 310.4(b)(1)(v).
  Most such calls are illegal,  and yet they continue to be prevalent.    The
  FTC is hosting the Contest in conjunction with the 2015 National Day of Civic
  Hacking. The Contest will challenge the public to contribute to the design of
  robocall honeypots - information systems intended to attract perpetrators of
  illegal robocalls and gather knowledge about robocaller tactics. The Contest
  is intended to engage individuals or teams of individuals with information security
  expertise (collectively “Contestants”) to apply their knowledge to further the
  design of robocall honeypots.    The Contest is subject to all applicable laws
  and regulations. Registering to enter the Contest constitutes Contestant’s full
  agreement to these Official Rules and to decisions of the Sponsor (as defined
  below), which are final and binding in all matters related to the Contest. Winning
  a Prize is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements set forth in the Official
  Rules.  <h2>1. Sponsor and Participating Organizations</h2>  A. Sponsor: Federal
  Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW; Washington, DC 20580.    B. Participating
  Organizations:  <blockquote>(i) Pindrop Security, Inc., 817 West Peachtree Street
  NW, Suite 770; Atlanta, GA 30308;    (ii) Canadian Radio-television Telecommunications
  Commission, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, K1A ON2.</blockquote>  The FTC reserves
  the right to modify the list of Participating Organizations at any time and
  will provide any updates on the Contest Website.  <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>  A.
  To participate in the Contest:  <blockquote>(i) Contestants may compete as individuals
  or as teams of individuals, if they meet all eligibility requirements set forth
  in Sections 2.A-C. To be eligible to win a Prize, Contestants must meet the
  additional prize eligibility requirements set forth in Section 9.    (ii) Contestants
  must comply with all terms and conditions of the Official Rules.    (iii) Contestants
  must own or have access at their own expense to a computer, an Internet connection,
  and any other electronic devices, documentation, software, or other items that
  Contestants may deem necessary to create and enter a Submission (as defined
  in Section 4 below).    (iv) Each team must appoint one individual (the “Representative”)
  to represent and act on behalf of said team, including by entering a Submission.
  The Representative must be duly authorized to submit on behalf of the team,
  and must represent and warrant that he or she is duly authorized to act on behalf
  of the team.    (v) An individual may enter the Contest only once, either on
  an individual basis or as a member of one team.    (vi) No individual or team
  may enter the Contest on behalf of a corporation or other non-individual legal
  entity.</blockquote>  B. The following individuals (including any individuals
  participating as part of a team) are not eligible regardless of whether they
  meet the criteria set forth above:  <blockquote>(i) any individual under the
  age of 18;    (ii) any individual who employs any of the Contest Judges as an
  employee or agent;    (iii) any individual who owns or controls an entity for

  immediate family or household of any such employee, representative, or agent;    (viii)
  any Federal employee acting within the scope of his or her employment, or as
  may otherwise be prohibited by Federal law (employees should consult their agency
  ethics officials);    (ix) any individual or team that used Federal facilities
  or consulted with Federal employees to develop a Submission, unless the facilities
  and employees were made available to all Contestants participating in the Contest
  on an equitable basis; and    (x) any individual or team that used Federal funds
  to develop a Submission, unless such use is consistent with the grant award,
  or other applicable Federal funds awarding document. If a grantee using Federal
  funds enters and wins this Contest, the prize monies shall be treated as program
  income for purposes of the original grant in accordance with applicable Office
  of Management and Budget Circulars. Federal contractors may not use Federal
  funds from a contract to develop a Submission for this Challenge.</blockquote>  The
  Sponsor will, in its sole discretion, disqualify any individual or team that
  meets any of the criteria set forth in Section 2.B.    C. For purposes hereof:  <blockquote>(i)

  to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science Reauthorization
  Act of 2010, 15 U.S.C. 3719, Contest Prizes (as defined in Section 8 below)
  may be awarded only to individuals and teams of individuals who are citizens
  or permanent residents of the United States, subject to verification by the
  Sponsor before Prizes are awarded (see Section 9 below).  <h2>3. Registration
  Requirement for all Contestants</h2>  A. Beginning at 9:00 am EDT on June 6,
  2015, Contestants may register to participate in the Contest.    B. To enter,
  every Contestant, including all members of a team, must register by submitting
  a form (“Registration Form”) to verify that he or she has read and agreed to
  abide by the Official Rules and meets the eligibility requirements, including
  that he or she: (1) is at least 18 years old; (2) does not have a familial,
  or material business or financial relationship with any Contest Judge; and (3)
  has not been convicted of a felony. The Registration Form will be available
  to Contestants beginning at 9:00 am EDT on June 6, 2015. Additional information
  and requirements about the registration process will be provided on the Contest
  Website.    C. Contestants should register as soon as possible and after their
  registration is completed, will receive access to the data to be analyzed. Contestants
  must submit their Registration Forms before the Submission Deadline. Contest
  participation will be limited to the first 50 individuals or teams who register.    D.
  After a Contestant registers, the Sponsor will send a confirmation message to
  the email address provided by the Contestant. The Contestant should use the
  confirmation message to verify the email address that he or she provided in
  order to receive important Contest updates.    E. In the event of a dispute
  pertaining to this Contest, the authorized account holder of the email address
  listed at registration will be deemed to be the Contestant. The “authorized
  account holder” is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet
  access provider, online service provider, or other organization responsible
  for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address.
  Contestants may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder.  <h2>4.
  Submission</h2>  A. To participate in any phase of the Contest, a Contestant
  must submit the following:  <blockquote>(i) solution source code;    (ii) a
  written description of the Submission (see Section 7); and    (iii) any other
  materials required under Section 7 below, including robocall predictions and
  access to technologies needed to test the Submission, including any legal rights
  or licenses required to access the technologies.</blockquote>  Paragraphs (i)-(iii)
  above are collectively a “Submission.” If the Sponsor permits submission via
  email, Contestants must use the email address provided on their Registration
  Forms (or in the case of a team, the email address on the team Representative’s
  Registration Form). With the exception of this originating email address, no
  part of the Submission shall contain information revealing the Contestant’s
  identity, such as a name, address, employment information, or other identifying
  details. Additional information about and requirements for the Submission process
  will be provided on the Contest Website.    B. Submission Deadlines    Contestants
  must enter their Submissions by June 7, 2015 at 8:00 pm EDT (“Contest Deadline”).
  The Sponsor’s computer is the official time-keeping device for this Contest.
  The Sponsor reserves the right, in its discretion, to extend the Contest Deadline
  at any time in appropriate circumstances and without prior notice. Any Submissions
  entered following the Contest Deadline shall be disqualified. The Judging Period
  will commence after the Contest Deadline.    C. Submission Requirements  <blockquote>(i)

  may require the Sponsor or Contest Judges to spend money or otherwise obtain
  anything of value; or to execute or enter into any binding agreement (except
  for a non-disclosure or non-compete agreement) not otherwise provided for under
  these Rules.    (iv) Submissions from a team must be indicated as such when
  entering a Submission.    (v) With the exception of source code, Submissions

  are not publicly available. Contestants must identify any portion of the solution
  that was publicly available and include a narrative description of the new functionality,
  features, or changes with any such Submission.    (vii) Submissions must not:  <blockquote>a.
  violate applicable law;    b. depict hatred;    c. be in bad taste;    d. denigrate
  (or be derogatory toward) any person or group of persons or any race, ethnic
  group, or culture;    e. threaten a specific community in society, including
  any specific race, ethnic group, or culture;    f. incite violence or be likely
  to incite violence;    g. contain vulgar or obscene language or excessive violence;    h.

  Additional Terms  <blockquote>(i) Once a Submission has been submitted, Contestant
  may not access or make any changes or alterations to the Submission.    (ii)
  A Contestant may submit only one Submission as either an individual or a member
  of a team.    (iii) By entering a Submission, Contestant represents, warrants,
  and agrees that the Submission is the original work of the Contestant and complies
  with the Official Rules.</blockquote>  Contestant further represents, warrants,
  and agrees that any use of the Submission by the Sponsor and Contest Judges
  (or any of their respective partners, subsidiaries, and affiliates) as authorized
  by these Official Rules, does not:  <blockquote>a. infringe upon, misappropriate
  or otherwise violate any intellectual property right or proprietary right including,
  without limitation, any statutory or common law trademark, copyright or patent,
  nor any privacy rights, nor any other rights of any person or entity;    b.
  constitute or result in any misappropriation or other violation of any person’s
  publicity rights or right of privacy.</blockquote>  <h2>5. Submission Rights</h2>  By
  entering a Submission to this Contest, Contestant grants to any person obtaining
  a copy of his or her Submission, a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free
  and worldwide license to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, or distribute the
  Submission, any information and content submitted by the Contestant, and any
  portion thereof. Contestants agree that such Submissions shall be made and remain
  available to all for use on an open source basis, as defined by the Open Source
  Initiative, see opensource.org. Contestant further grants to the Sponsor the
  right to display the Submission on the Internet. The Contestant agrees that
  the foregoing constitutes a condition of the Contestant’s participation in the
  Contest, and that the Contest is not a request for, or acquisition of, any property
  or service or any other matter subject to federal procurement requirements.  <h2>6.
  Winner Selection and Judging Criteria</h2>  A. All Submissions will be judged
  by an expert panel of judges (the “Contest Judges”) selected by the Sponsor
  at the Sponsor’s sole discretion. The Sponsor reserves the right to substitute
  or modify the judging panel, or extend or modify the Judging Period, at any
  time for any reason.    B. All Contest Judges shall be required to remain fair
  and impartial. Any Contest Judge may recuse him or herself from judging a Submission
  if the Contest Judge or the Sponsor considers it inappropriate, for any reason,
  for the Contest Judge to evaluate a specific Submission or group of Submissions.    C.
  A Contestant’s likelihood of winning will depend on the number and quality of
  all of the Submissions, as determined by the Contest Judges using the criteria
  in these Official Rules.    D. For all phases, the Sponsor reserves the right
  to review the Contest Judges’ decision and to withhold any Prize if, at the
  Sponsor’s sole discretion, there is a procedural, legal, or other reason that
  the Prize should not be awarded.    E. The Sponsor intends to announce the Winners
  within two months of the Contest Period, and the results will be made available
  on the Contest Website. The Sponsor, however, reserves the right to change the
  announcement date at any time with or without prior notice for any reason.  <h2>7.
  Solution Requirements</h2>  A. Each Contestant will have access to two sets
  of call data from an existing robocall honeypot. Contestants will be authorized
  to access the data only after the Contestant submits a Registration Form to
  the Sponsor. To access this data, Contestants may also be required to agree
  to certain terms and conditions specified by Pindrop. Contestants may not disseminate
  this data to any individual or legal entity other than another team member,
  and Contestants shall be disqualified from the Contest by the Sponsor if they
  do so. The first data set will identify calls that are likely to have been a
  robocall (a call delivering a prerecorded message). Based on information provided
  in the first data set, Contestants will develop an algorithm and will predict
  which of the calls in the second data set are likely to be robocalls. The Contestants’
  predictions must be submitted in ascii text format using CSV. In addition to
  submitting these predictions, each Contestant must submit all source code and
  a written description of the algorithm consisting of fewer than 250 words.    Judging
  Criteria:  <blockquote>(i) Uncovering the Truth (70% of total score)  <blockquote>How
  well did you predict whether the calls in the second honeypot data set were
  likely to be robocalls? To assess this, the Contest Judges will compare your
  predictions with actual data about which calls are likely to be a robocall in
  the second data set. You will receive one point for each call you successfully
  identified as a likely robocall, and deducted two points for each call you inaccurately
  identified as a likely robocall.</blockquote>  (ii) Explaining the Scheme (20%
  of total score)  <blockquote>What insights did your Submission demonstrate with
  respect to the analysis of honeypot call records?</blockquote>  (iii) Innovation
  (10% of total score)  <blockquote>How innovative was your Submission?</blockquote>  </blockquote>  B.
  In order to be considered for a Prize, Submissions must receive a score greater
  than zero in each required category (uncovering the truth, explaining the scheme,
  and innovation). If the Contest Judges determine that no one satisfies each
  required category, no one will be deemed eligible for any Prize.    C. The one
  (1) Contestant or Contestants whose Submission earns the highest overall score
  will be named Winner of the Top Prize identified below in Section 8, if the
  Contestant satisfies the verification requirements described in Section 9. If
  the Contestant does not satisfy the verification requirements, the Top Prize
  may be awarded to the next highest scorer who satisfies the verification requirements,
  at the Contest Judges’ or Sponsor’s discretion.    D. Up to two (2) Contestants
  with the next highest scores who meet the Section 9 verification requirements
  may be awarded the Honorable Mention Prizes—described below in Section 8—at
  the Contest Judges’ or the Sponsor’s discretion. If the Contestant does not
  satisfy the verification requirements, the Honorable Mention Prize may be awarded
  to the next highest scorer who satisfies the verification requirements, at the
  Contest Judges’ or Sponsor’s discretion.    E. In the event of a tie between
  or among two or more Submissions where the Contestants meet the verification
  requirements, the relevant Prize identified below in Section 8 will be divided
  equally between the tied Contestants.  <h2>8. Prizes</h2>  <table class="responsive-table">  <thead>  <tr>  <th>Winner</th>  <th>Prize</th>  <th>Quantity</th>  </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>  <tr>  <td>Top
  Prize</td>  <td>Champion RoboSleuth Award</td>  <td>1</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>Honorable
  Mention(s)</td>  <td>Master RoboSleuth Award(s)</td>  <td>2</td>  </tr>  </tbody>  </table>  A.
  If no eligible Submissions are entered in the Contest, no Prizes will be awarded.    B.
  Each Contestant hereby acknowledges and agrees that the relationship between
  the Contestant and the Sponsor is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other special
  relationship, and that the Contestant’s decision to provide the Contestant’s
  Submission to Sponsor for the purposes of this Contest does not place the Sponsor
  and its respective agents in a position that is any different from the position
  held by the members of the general public with regard to elements of the Contestant’s
  Submission, except as specifically provided in these Official Rules.  <h2>9.
  Verification of Eligibility for Receipt of a Prize</h2>  A. ALL PRIZE AWARDS
  ARE SUBJECT TO SPONSOR VERIFICATION OF THE WINNER’S IDENTITY, ELIGIBILITY, AND
  PARTICIPATION IN THE CREATION OF THE SOLUTION. THE SPONSOR’S DECISIONS ARE FINAL
  AND BINDING IN ALL MATTERS RELATED TO THE CONTEST. In order to receive a Prize,
  a Contestant will be required to complete, sign and return to the Sponsor affidavit(s)
  of eligibility and liability release, or a similar verification document (“Verification
  Form”). (In the case of a team, the Representative and all participating members
  must complete, sign and return to the Sponsor the Verification Form.)    B.
  Contestants potentially qualifying for a Prize will be notified and sent the
  Verification Form using the email address submitted at registration within two
  months of the Contest Period. The Sponsor reserves the right to change the time
  period to send the Verification Form without providing any prior notice. In
  the case of a team, the notification will only be sent to the Representative.
  If a notification is returned as undeliverable, the Contestant or team may be
  disqualified at the Sponsor’s sole discretion.    C. At the sole discretion
  of the Sponsor, a Contestant or team forfeits any Prize if:  <blockquote>(i)
  the Contestant fails to provide the Verification Form within five (5) business
  days of receipt of the email notification discussed above (or in the case of
  a team, any team member fails to provide the Verification Form within five business
  days of receipt of the email notification);    (ii) the Contestant (or in the
  case of a team, its Representative) does not timely communicate with the Sponsor
  to provide all other necessary information within five business days of receiving
  a request for such information;    (iii) such individual or team Representative
  is contacted and refuses the Prize; or    (iv) the Submission of the Winner,
  the Winner, or any member of a Winner’s team is disqualified for any reason.</blockquote>  D.
  In the event of a disqualification, Sponsor, at its sole discretion, may award
  the applicable Prize to an alternate Contestant. The disqualification of one
  (or more) team members at any time for any reason may result in the disqualification
  of the entire team and of each participating member at the sole discretion of
  the Sponsor.  <h2>10. Entry Conditions and Release</h2>  A. By registering,
  each Contestant (including, in the case of a team, all participating members)
  agree(s):  <blockquote>(i) to comply with and be bound by these Official Rules;
  and    (ii) that the application of the judging criteria, evaluation of the
  Submissions, and final selection of the winners is a matter of discretion of
  the Contest Judges and Sponsor, and that their respective decisions are binding
  and final in all matters relating to this Contest.</blockquote>  B. By registering,
  each Contestant (including, in the case of a team, all participating members)
  agree(s) to release, indemnify, and hold harmless the Sponsor, Participating
  Organizations, and any other individuals or organizations responsible for sponsoring,
  fulfilling, administering, advertising, or promoting the Contest, including
  their respective parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies, if any, and
  all of their respective past and present officers, directors, employees, agents
  and representatives (hereafter the “Released Parties”) from and against any
  and all claims, expenses, and liabilities (including reasonable attorneys’ fees
  and costs of Submission preparation) arising out of or relating to a Contestant’s
  entry, creation of Submission or entry of a Submission, participation in the
  Contest, acceptance or use or misuse of the Prize, and the disclosure, broadcast,
  transmission, performance, exploitation, or use of Submission as authorized
  or licensed by these Official Rules. Released claims include all claims whatsoever
  including, but not limited to (except in cases of willful misconduct): injury,
  death, damage, or loss of property, revenue, or profits, whether direct, indirect,
  or consequential, arising from the Contestant’s participation in a competition,
  whether the claim of injury, death, damage, or loss arises through negligence,
  mistake or otherwise. This release does not apply to claims against the Sponsor
  arising out of the unauthorized use or disclosure by the Sponsor of intellectual
  property, trade secrets, or confidential business information of the Contestant.    C.
  Without limiting the foregoing, each Contestant (including, in the case of a
  team, all participating members) agrees to release all Released Parties of all
  liability in connection with:  <blockquote>(i) any incorrect or inaccurate information,
  whether caused by the Sponsor’s or a Contestant’s electronic or printing error
  or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the
  Contest;    (ii) technical failures of any kind, including, but not limited
  to, malfunctions, interruptions, or disconnections in phone lines, internet
  connectivity, or electronic transmission errors, or network hardware or software
  or failure of the Contest Website, or any other platform or tool that Contestants
  or Contest Judges choose to use;    (iii) unauthorized human intervention in
  any part of the entry process or the Contest;    (iv) technical or human error
  that may occur in the administration of the Contest or the processing of Submissions;
  or    (v) any injury or damage to persons or property that may be caused, directly
  or indirectly, in whole or in part, from the Contestant’s participation in the
  Contest or receipt or use or misuse of any Prize. If for any reason any Contestant’s
  Submission is confirmed to have been erroneously deleted, lost, or otherwise
  destroyed or corrupted, the Contestant’s sole remedy is to request the opportunity
  to resubmit its Submission. The request will be addressed at the sole discretion
  of the Sponsor if the Contest Submission Period is still open.</blockquote>  D.
  Based on the subject matter of the Contest, the type of work that it possibly
  will require, and the low probability that any claims for death, bodily injury,
  or property damage, or loss could result from Contest participation, the Sponsor
  determines that Contestants are not required to obtain liability insurance or
  demonstrate fiscal responsibility in order to participate in this Contest.  <h2>11.
  Publicity</h2>  Participation in the Contest constitutes consent to the use
  by the Sponsor and Participating Organizations, their agents’, and any other
  third parties acting on their behalf, of the Contestant’s name (and, as applicable,
  those of all other members of the team that participated in the Submission)
  for promotional purposes in any media, worldwide, without further payment or
  consideration. Furthermore, a Contestant’s likeness, photograph, voice, opinions,
  comments, and hometown and state of residence (and, as applicable, those of
  all other members of the team that participated in the Submission) may be used
  for the Sponsor or Participating Organizations’ promotional purposes if the
  Contestant provides consent. In addition, Sponsor and Participating Organizations
  reserve the right to make any disclosure required by law.  <h2>12. General Conditions</h2>  A.
  Each Contestant agrees that the Sponsor is vested with the sole authority to
  interpret and apply these rules.    B. Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole
  discretion, to cancel, suspend, or modify the Contest, or any part of it, with
  or without notice to the contestants, if any fraud, technical failure, or any
  other unanticipated factor or factors beyond Sponsor’s control impairs the integrity
  or proper functioning of the Contest or for any other reason. The Sponsor reserves
  the right at its sole discretion to disqualify any individual or Contestant
  that the Sponsor finds to be tampering with the entry process or the operation
  of the Contest, or to be acting in violation of these Official Rules or in a
  manner that is inappropriate, not in the best interests of this Contest, or
  in violation of any applicable law or regulation.    C. Any attempt by any person
  to undermine the proper functioning of the Contest may be a violation of criminal
  and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, the Sponsor reserves the
  right to take proper legal action, including, without limiting, referral to
  law enforcement, for any illegal or unlawful activities.    D. The Sponsor’s

  of that term. The Sponsor is not responsible for incomplete, late, misdirected,
  damaged, lost, illegible, or incomprehensible Submissions or for address or
  email address changes of the Contestants. Proof of sending or submitting is
  not proof of receipt by Sponsor.    E. In the event of any discrepancy or inconsistency

  any time, including the rights or obligations of the Contestant and the Sponsor.
  The Sponsor will post the terms and conditions of the amended Official Rules
  on the Contest Website (“Corrective Notice”). As permitted by law, any amendment
  will become effective at the time the Sponsor posts the amended Official Rules.    G.

  Rules be or become illegal or unenforceable under applicable Federal law, such
  illegality or unenforceability shall leave the remainder of these Official Rules
  unaffected and valid. The illegal or unenforceable provision may be replaced
  by the Sponsor with a valid and enforceable provision that, in the Sponsor’s
  sole judgment, comes closest and best reflects the Sponsor’s intention in a
  legal and enforceable manner with respect to the invalid or unenforceable provision.  <h2>13.

judging-criteria-description-0: How well did you predict whether the calls in
  the second honeypot data set were likely to be robocalls? To assess this, the
  Contest Judges will compare your predictions with actual data about which calls
  are likely to be a robocall in the second data set. You will receive one point
  for each call you successfully identified as a likely robocall, and deducted
  two points for each call you inaccurately identified as a likely robocall.

description: As part of the National Day of Civic Hacking, the FTC challenges you
  to DetectaRobo!    <strong>Your mission:</strong> Use data from a honeypot to predict
  which incoming calls are robocalls.    For this contest, you’ll be given two sets
  of call data from an existing honeypot. The first set will indicate which calls
  are likely robocalls; the second set won’t. Use the first set to develop an algorithm,
  and then apply your algorithm to the second set to predict which calls are robocalls.
  Work on your own or as a team.
