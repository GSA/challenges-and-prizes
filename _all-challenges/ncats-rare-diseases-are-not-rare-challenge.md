description: "<h3>Summary</h3>\r\n<p>The National Center for Advancing Translational
  Sciences (NCATS), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking innovative
  ways to communicate with others to educate people about rare diseases through social
  media or art. The goal of this Challenge, which is being led by NCATS&rsquo; Office
  of Rare Diseases Research, is threefold: First and foremost, it is to raise awareness
  for all rare diseases in a collective manner. Second, it is intended to bring attention
  to the many people with rare diseases; and finally, it is to highlight the need
  for research and the development of new treatments. <strong>You can help us get
  the word out by competing in our rare diseases prize competition!</strong></p>\r\n<p>In
  addition to cash prizes for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners, the 1st place winner(s)
  will be invited to NIH to present the winning entry at the Rare Disease Day at NIH
  event (February 2019); all winners and 10 honorable mentions will be posted on the
  NCATS public website.</p>\r\n<h3>Dates and Deadlines</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Entries
  must be submitted to Challenge.gov by Noon Eastern time on October 28, 2018.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>The
  Challenge begins: September 30, 2018&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Submission Period: September
  30, 2018 &ndash; October 28, 2018</p>\r\n<p>Judging Period: November 12, 2018 &ndash;
  November 26, 2018</p>\r\n<p>Winners Announced: December 2018&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Subject
  of the Challenge Competition</h3>\r\n<p>Rare Diseases Are Not Rare! If you know
  10 people, chances are you know someone with a rare disease. There are about 7,000
  different rare diseases that affect an estimated 30 million Americans. This is more
  than twice the number of people living with cancer, more than the number of people
  living with HIV and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease combined, and more than the population
  of Texas.</p>\r\n<p>Some difficulties with rare diseases are that they are hard
  to recognize, are often hidden conditions, and most currently are not being studied
  via ongoing medical research. We are asking you to help us bring attention to rare
  diseases so that they can gain more medical research interest, thereby improving
  the lives of people with rare diseases. Science, especially genetic medicine, has
  moved forward to the point now where treatments are possible &mdash; such as gene
  therapies, 3-D printing (devices, tissues and organs) and new drugs. Everyone deserves
  a chance at an effective medical treatment &mdash; whether for a common disease
  or a rare one &mdash; so let&rsquo;s get the word out!</p>\r\n<p>Here are a few
  facts to consider:</p>\r\n<p>- Most rare diseases are genetic (around 80%) &mdash;
  they are caused by changes to a person&rsquo;s DNA (mutations) usually present at
  birth. We all have DNA, and we all have mutations, whether they cause a disease
  or not depends on where the mutations are and whether they impact our ability to
  function.</p>\r\n<p>- Rare diseases also can be due to infections, such as Ebola,
  or in the U.S., malaria, Chagas&rsquo; disease or tuberculosis.</p>\r\n<p>- Many
  types of cancer, such as leukemia and lymphoma, and brain tumors are rare diseases.</p>\r\n<p>-
  About half of those diagnosed with rare diseases are children.</p>\r\n<p>- Rare
  diseases can affect anyone, in any family, anywhere in the world. Sometimes they
  run in families, but often they occur with no family history.</p>\r\n<p>- Rare diseases
  can affect many different organs and disease areas, such as rare lung diseases (e.g.,
  cystic fibrosis), movement (muscular dystrophy), the brain (certain types of autism
  or cerebral palsy), the blood (sickle cell anemia), and many others.</p>\r\n<p>-
  &ldquo;Cancer&rdquo; is actually a collection of hundreds of diseases, even though
  it is often referred to by just one easily recognizable word.</p>\r\n<p>- Many common
  diseases are actually collections of several different rare diseases that affect
  people in a similar way. For example, &ldquo;breast cancer&rdquo; is actually a
  collection of several different cancers, some of which are rare.</p>\r\n<p><strong>You
  can help by competing in our rare disease prize competition.</strong> Here&rsquo;s
  what we&rsquo;re asking you to do:</p>\r\n<p>Find a way to communicate with others
  and to educate people about rare diseases through social media or art. Use any communication
  vehicle you choose; be as creative and original as possible. Here are examples of
  appropriate communication vehicles:</p>\r\n<p>- music video</p>\r\n<p>- song (with
  or without sheet music)</p>\r\n<p>- dramatic reading</p>\r\n<p>poem</p>\r\n<p>-
  painting</p>\r\n<p>- mime</p>\r\n<p>poster</p>\r\n<p>- comic</p>\r\n<p>- animation</p>\r\n<p>-
  photo/collage</p>\r\n<p>- new name for &ldquo;rare diseases&rdquo; as a whole</p>\r\n<p>-
  puppets</p>\r\n<p>Each team or individual may submit only one entry.</p>\r\n<h3>Evaluation
  and Winner Selection</h3>\r\n<p>Basis upon Which Winner Will Be Selected. A panel
  of federal and non-federal judges, with expertise directly relevant to this Challenge,
  will evaluate the entries based on criteria listed below and will select the Challenge
  winners. NCATS will provide feedback from the judges to the winners and non-winners.</p>\r\n<p>The
  percentages assigned to each set of evaluation criteria are guidelines from NCATS
  to suggest which features are of emphasis and interest to the Center.</p>\r\n<p>Only
  complete submissions will be reviewed.</p>"
