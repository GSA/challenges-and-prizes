description: '<p>This
  challenge seeks ideas for how you would partner with the federal government to make
  a meaningful impact on the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community.
  Proposals may include innovation, enhanced infrastructure, or a solution for a hot
  topic issue to achieve effective outcomes during a focused amount of time (e.g.
  one year) on a project of choice. The White House Initiative on AAPIs is calling
  for submissions on great ideas to work in partnership with the federal government
  to expand opportunities for the AAPI community.</p><p>View our <a title="National AAPI
  Community Google+ Hangout link" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffIHSjlKyto&amp;feature=c4-overview&amp;list=UUBDnqUbZI2JstkwiTqqJguA"
  target="_blank">National AAPI Community Google+ Hangout</a>for the announcement
  about this Challenge.</p><p>    <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">America is home to 18.2
  million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) who are part of diverse communities
  with diverse needs. They speak numerous languages, represent several cultures, and
  all are part of America.</p><p>It’s a time of extraordinary growth for the AAPI community.
  The AAPI population is on the rise in every region of the country. In fact, the
  population has increased by nearly 50% in just 10 years. The White House Initiative
  on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (WHIAAPI or Initiative) is working with
  local leaders to provide the necessary tools for communities to keep up with this
  growth. WHIAAPI is also helping AAPIs realize the potential of an America built
  through shared prosperity and equal opportunity. We’re helping to build new government
  connections with the AAPI community on national and regional levels. </p><p>At the heart
  of this work is the desire for AAPIs to work across cultures and sectors to establish
  effective local services, and ultimately achieve prosperity nationwide.</span>    <i>Expanding
  Opportunity for AAPIs: WHIAAPI Proposal Challenge</i> is based on these principals
  and seeks to generate fresh ideas to expand the mission and work of the Initiative
  through ideas for potential partnerships.</p><p>Over the past three years, the Initiative
  has connected with diverse AAPI communities across the country. The Initiative has
  hosted more than 200 roundtables, stakeholder meetings and summits in 25 states,
  the District of Columbia and the Pacific Islands, reaching more than 30,000 individuals.
  Recent community engagement efforts have focused on emerging AAPI communities—targeting
  AAPIs in regions of the country that have experienced explosive growth over the
  past ten years. The Initiative has built upon those conversations with better-informed
  AAPI communities and federal agencies working together to address unique health,
  education, civil rights, economic and community development issues and cross-cutting
  policy areas including language access, data disaggregation, workforce diversity,
  and capacity building.</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The Initiative’s work
  has thrived on past partnerships with community-based organizations (CBOs) to implement
  Executive Order 13515, which reestablished the Initiative on October 14, 2009. Some
  examples of this collaborative work include:</span>  <ul>   <li>Parterning with
  AAPI professional development CBOs to conduct leadership roundtable series and summits;</li>   <li>Collaborating
  with AAPI health CBOs to present information on topical issues such as the HIV epidemic
  and conducting webinars and disseminating guidance;</li>   <li>Hosting the <i>iCount:
  Equity Through Representation</i> Symposium on data disaggregation with the National
  Commission on Asian American and Pacific Islander Research in Education and other
  CBOs;</li>   <li>Connecting with other Federal Agencies to provide technical assistance
  webinars on <a title="AANAPISI video link" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNeOn7Yb4ZQ&amp;list=UUBDnqUbZI2JstkwiTqqJguA&amp;feature=c4-overview"
  target="_blank">Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institutions
  (AANAPISI)</a>; and</li>   <li>Establishing a mentorship series for young professionals.</li>  </ul></p><p> The success of past partnerships has encouraged the Initiative to seek <b>new partnerships.</b> The
  Initiative invites proposals from <em>entities who have never partnered with the
  Initiative</em>, as well as <em>existing partners that have new proposals.</em> 
  These new partnerships will thrive on  the innovations proposed by the partner while
  also maintaining a focus on the Initiative’s current work on issues such as: immigration,
  health, health care, education, and workforce development.</p>'
