  #### General Overview


  The Naval Information Warfare Systems Command (NAVWARSYSCOM) and the Program Executive Office for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (PEO C4I) are conducting a third instance of the Artificial Intelligence Applications to Autonomous Cybersecurity (AI ATAC, pronounced “AI attack”) Challenge (hereinafter referred to as “the Challenge”). The Navy’s Information Assurance and Cybersecurity Program Office (PMW 130) seeks to enhance the Security Operations Center (SOC) using automated artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) tools to automate the detection and prevention of advanced persistent threat (APT) and other cybersecurity campaign activity. Current SOC operations require a tremendous amount of time and effort to triage alerts, link related logs, perform incident response, and document investigations. Through this AI ATAC Prize Challenge, PMW 130 is soliciting Security Orchestration & Automated Response (SOAR) tools that use AI/ML to enhance their effectiveness for competitive evaluation. Submissions must be accompanied by a submission description white-paper plus an overview video and a demonstration video describing the SOAR tool and associated technologies.


  This Challenge seeks to evaluate the utility of SOAR tools for NAVWAR security operation center (SOC) teams. SOAR tools as used in this challenge are technologies to coordinate, manage, and automate an organization’s SOC and federate an organization’s security processes, workflows, and procedures to provide a centralized, coordinated security posture for that organization. SOAR tools should significantly enhance the ability of security operators and analysts to perform their tasks (e.g., alert handling, ticket processing, threat detection, incident response, and post-compromise forensics) by providing machine-powered assistance to human analysts to improve the efficiency and consistency of people and processes. For instance, workflows or playbooks define the set of steps to address a potential threat, and SOAR tools may execute these steps automatically or guide a human analyst through them. SOAR tools using AI/ML should greatly enhance these benefits.


  For the purposes of this competition, SOAR tools are defined as tools that perform, coordinate, and automate the following actions: 


  * Ingest logs and alerts from a wide variety of security tools in a SOC;

  * Ingest or provide threat intelligence information from both internal and external sources;

  * Combine, coordinate, and enrich logging, alert, and threat data in the tool’s User Interface (UI);

  * Identify common attack patterns and highlight them in the tool’s UI;

  * Automate and ultimately simplify the alert triage and incident response processes via preset and configurable workflows or playbooks;

  * Facilitate simultaneous or asynchronous (e.g., via sharing or handing off) investigations by different, potentially geographically disparate operators, with access to potentially different types of information; and

  * Automate and expedite documentation of triage, incident response, and forensics (e.g., via ticketing). 


  This Challenge will measure the performance of these tools to determine how well they would provide improvements to U.S. Navy SOCs across the world.


  #### Key Dates


  * 10 December 2020: Kick-off of AI ATAC 3 on Challenge.gov

  * 8 January 2021: Deadline for potential Participants to send an email to indicate intent to participate (details below)

  * 12 February 2021:	All submissions due

  * TBD: Candidates selected for Phase 2 will be notified by email

  #### Total Cash Prize Purse


  $750,000


  #### Prize Breakdown


  NAVWARSYSCOM has established $750,000 as the total amount set aside for cash prizes under the Challenge. In the case of a single winner, the entire cash prize will be awarded to the winning entry. In the unlikely event of a tie, NAVWARSYSCOM will determine an equitable method of distributing the cash prizes. If a prize goes to a team of Participants, NAVWARSYSCOM will award the cash prize to the individual/team’s point of contact registered on the Challenge.gov website. 


  Tax treatment of prizes will be handled in accordance with U.S. Internal Revenue Service guidelines. The winner must provide a U.S. Taxpayer Identification Number (e.g., a SSN, TIN, EIN) to receive the cash prize.


  #### Non-monetary Prizes


  NAWARSYSCOM may award, pursuant to Title 10 U.S.C. § 2371b, a follow-on production contract or transaction to one or more Participants who successfully demonstrated an effective AI/ML SOAR capability under the Challenge. The Challenge, however, does not in any way obligate NAVWARSYSCOM to procure any of the items within the terms or bounds of this Challenge from any Participant, including from the Challenge winner(s).
