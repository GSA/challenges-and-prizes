  **LymeX Innovation Accelerator**


  In October 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation [announced](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/10/10/hhs-steven-alexandra-cohen-foundation-announce-25-million-lymex-innovation-accelerator.html) a new $25 million-dollar, public-private partnership — the [LymeX Innovation Accelerator](https://www.hhs.gov/cto/initiatives/innovation-and-partnerships/lyme-innovation/lymex/index.html) (LymeX). As the largest Lyme disease public-private partnership in history, LymeX collaborators include Lyme patients, patient advocates, and key stakeholders across academia, nonprofit organizations, industry, and the government. 


  LymeX has three key focus areas: 


  * Stakeholder engagement

  * Education and awareness

  * R&D for the development of next-generation diagnostics for at all stages of Lyme disease.

  **About Lyme and Other Tickborne Diseases in the United States** 


  In 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) used insurance records to estimate that [approximately 476,000 Americans are diagnosed and treated](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/humancases.html) for Lyme disease every year. Tick-borne diseases, including Lyme disease, are increasing in number, and expanding to new areas in the United States. According to the CDC, domestic cases of tick-borne diseases have [more than doubled from 2004 to 2018](https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dvbd/pdf/Brochure_National_Framework_VBDs-P.pdf). The development and survival of ticks, their animal hosts (such as deer), and the bacterium that causes Lyme disease are all [strongly influenced by climatic factors](https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/pubs/VECTOR-BORNE-DISEASE-Final_508.pdf), especially temperature, precipitation, and humidity.


  **LymeX Education and Awareness Healthathon Contest**


  **Challenge** 


  * Create educational materials (for example, social media content, educational or training videos, graphics, or posters) to help raise awareness about how to recognize the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease, how to prevent tick bites, how to recognize a tick, what to do if you’ve been bitten, or when to seek medical care. 


  **Eligibility**


  * This challenge is open to all who are eligible. Those in the Lyme community, educators, innovators, and health experts who can better educate others through their own experiences relating to this disease are encouraged to enter. 


  **Create materials using resources from federal Lyme and Tickborne disease websites**
