  Water managers need more skillful information on weather and climate
  conditions to help efficiently utilize water resources to reduce the impact of
  hydrologic variations. Examples of hydrologic variations include the onset of
  drought or a wet weather extreme. Lacking skillful sub-seasonal information
  limits water managers’ ability to prepare for shifts in hydrologic regimes and
  can pose major threats to their ability to manage the valuable resource.


  The challenge of sub-seasonal forecasting encompasses the lead times of 15 to 45 days into the future, which lay between those of weather forecasting (i.e. up to 15 days, where initial ocean and atmospheric conditions matter most) and seasonal to longer-lead climate forecasting (i.e. beyond 45 days, where slowly varying earth system conditions matter most, such as sea surface temperatures, soil moisture, snow pack).


  The Rodeo II Challenge series will create algorithms to enhance sub-seasonal forecasting, reducing risks to our water systems, and helping water managers efficiently manage hydrological variations.


  This challenge series will first have one traditional marathon match challenge to establish predictive algorithms on historical weather data, and then recurring data science challenges (sprints) over the next **full year** to refine those solutions on live weather data.


  **Key Dates**


  **Pre-Registration:** June 27 to week of July 19, 2019


  **Marathon Match:** Week of July 19th to week of August 18th, 2019


  **Data Science Sprints:** Fall 2019 start to Fall 2020 with recurring sprints every two weeks over the full year.


  **Marathon Match Winners:** Anticipate announcement late to early September 2019


  **Data Science Sprint Winners:** Anticipate announcement of winners after each sprint, beginning in late Fall 2019


  **Data Science Full Year Winners:** Anticipate announcement of winners at the end of the full year in late 2020 to possibly early 2021.
prizes: This series will have more than $800,000 in prize money available over
  the next year.
rules: All contest details, including timeline, marathon match, and data sprint
  details can be found on the [Topcoder Rodeo II
  website](http://topcoder.com/lp/rodeo2).
judging: >-
  **Marathon Match:** Short term competition (over a 1-2 month period beginning
  in July) with solvers submitting a hind-cast over a set period of historic
  temperature and precipitation data. Performance of submissions will be
  evaluated against historic data.


  **Data Science Sprints:** Year-long competition following the Marathon Match with solvers submitting forecasts every two weeks. Submissions will be scored against real-time forecasts at the 3-4 week and 5-6 week timeframes
how-to-enter: All submissions must be made online through the [Topcoder Rodeo II
