description: Competitors will be asked to produce an in-vitro vascularized
  tissue that is>1 centimeter in thickness in all dimensions at the launch of
  the trial and maintains>85% survival of the required parenchymal cells
  throughout a 30-day period. Tissues must provide adequate blood perfusion
  without uncontrolled leakage into the bulk tissue to maintain metabolic
  functionality similar to their in-vivo native cells. Histological measurement
  of the quality and amount of functional performance will be required to
  determine survival of parenchymal tissue. Teams must demonstrate 3 successful
  trials with at least a 75% trial success rate to win an award. In addition to
  the in-vitro trials, teams must also submit a Spaceflight Experiment Concept
  that details how they would further advance some aspect of their tissue
  vascularization research through a microgravity experiment that could be
  conducted in the U.S. National Laboratory (ISS-NL) onboard the International
  Space Station.
