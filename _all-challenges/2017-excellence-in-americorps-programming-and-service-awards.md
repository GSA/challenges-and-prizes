rules: '<strong>Award Categories and Considerations -- Select from only one of
  the following for each nomination:</strong>  <ol>    <li>Best new program addressing
  a critical priority (new is a program launched since September 2015); things
  to consider in this category:  <ul>    <li>This category is for an entirely
  new program in which AmeriCorps members were not previously engaged in service
  under this organization.</li>    <li>The nomination should explain how the addition
  of member interventions/activities are addressing the critical priority in the
  community.</li>  </ul>  </li>    <li>Most significant enhancement to an existing
  program; things to consider in this category:  <ul>    <li>This category is
  for current AmeriCorps programs in which members are already serving.</li>    <li>The
  focus of the nomination in this category should be on the organization/program/enhancement
  specifically.</li>    <li>It may be appropriate to describe the people (national
  service members, staff, and volunteers) involved in this effort, but please
  focus the nomination on the program or enhancement itself.</li>  </ul>  </li>    <li>Member
  with disability (ies) who significantly contributed to increasing the participation
  of other individuals with disabilities in national service; things to consider
  in this category:  <ul style="text-align: left;">    <li>This category is for
  an AmeriCorps member who has disclosed having a disability and has served to
  recruit other members to serve in his/her program or in national service as
  a whole.</li>    <li>This category is also for an AmeriCorps member who has
  disclosed having a disability and has engaged community members with disabilities
  for creative/innovative problem solving within the broader community.</li>  </ul>  4.
  Most compelling member experience in either building an ethic of civic responsibility
  or having positive change in her/his life; things to consider in this category:  <ul>    <li>The
  member experience may foster civic responsibility, strengthen the ties that
  bind a community together as a people, and provide educational or other professional
  opportunities for the member.</li>    <li>In general, behaviors, attitudes,
  and actions are the common principles of citizenship and civic engagement. Active
  citizenship encompasses a broad range of involvement and can be defined as "the
  act of contributing to public life and participating in solving public problems."</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ol>  <strong>Eligibility:</strong>    Eligible
  nominees are current service participants and alumni, and current programs funded
  through AmeriCorps grants (or subgrants) from the Corporation for National and
  Community Service. Those programs include:  <ul>    <li>AmeriCorps State</li>    <li>AmeriCorps
  National</li>    <li>Tribal programs funded by AmeriCorps</li>    <li>AmeriCorps
  VISTA</li>    <li>AmeriCorps NCCC</li>  </ul>  Nominees should select only one
  award category and one program affiliation per submission.    <strong>Nomination
  Content:</strong>    Submit a narrative of up to 500 words that clearly and
  concisely describes the nominee’s best program design, enhancement, expansion,
  or experience and accomplishments as a member for the award category selected.
  Ideally, the narrative will include evidence of the nominee’s impact in the
  community or on the program or other local projects, as well as evidence to
  support the nominee’s work or service as innovative, a best practice and/or
  a highly compelling and motivating experience.    Submissions may also include
  photos. Photos should support the narrative submission and not replace it. Photos
  are encouraged as they are often very helpful in telling the complete service
  story. Please note that photos are not required.    By submitting a nomination,
  each participant automatically confers on CNCS an irrevocable, nonexclusive,
  and unrestricted license to use the submitted content for purposes consistent
  with the agency’s national service mission. This includes the right to copy,
  reproduce, display, or distribute the content of the submission, and to make
  derivative works based upon the submission or a substantial portion of it without
  attribution or prior permission.    <strong>Instructions for Writing the Nomination
  Narrative:</strong>  <ol>    <li>Each nomination should specify from the eligibility
  list the program with which it is affiliated. In addition, the narrative should
  address how the AmeriCorps member or program is addressing one of the award
  categories. Enter the award category and full name of the nominee in the Title
  field in the Submit Solution link.</li>    <li>Clearly identify the full name
  of the nominee, the AmeriCorps program affiliation, and the award category in
  the first sentence of the nomination narrative.</li>    <li>Provide the full
  name and email address of the nominator and the nominator’s affiliation with
  the nominee in the second sentence of the nomination. Note that nominations will
  not be considered complete or reviewed without the full name and contact information
  for the nominator.</li>    <li>Select <u>only one program affiliation and only
  one nomination category</u> for each submission. In the event a program and
  individual are both eligible to be nominated, submit two separate nominations:
  one for the new or enhanced program and one for the member, following the award
  category descriptions.</li>    <li>Describe how the nominee exemplifies excellence
  in AmeriCorps service or programming. Consider these questions: what made the
  service excellent? what data can you provide to support the impact the member
  or program made?</li>    <li>Provide details that vividly illustrate the significance
  of the nominated member service/program. Details should clearly show how the
  nominated service goes above and beyond the excellent service that is expected
  from all AmeriCorps members and programs each year.</li>    <li>Tailor the nomination
  narrative to the Excellence in AmeriCorps Service and Programming instructions.</li>    <li>Carefully
  proof read and review the nomination for completeness before submitting it in
  the Challenge Program.</li>  </ol>  &nbsp;    <strong>Format for Submitting
  a Nomination:</strong>    Nominations must be submitted as a Solution in the
  Challenge Program.    <strong>Limitations:</strong>    Individuals and programs

  and Answers:</strong>    <em>--Could you provide the definition of “AmeriCorps
  programming?” In order for a program to be eligible for a program award, does
  it have to be funded entirely through AmeriCorps, or is it sufficient that VISTA
  members serve and contribute to the program?</em>    Answer: AmeriCorps programming
  can mean a program that is entirely focused on and funded by AmeriCorps, or
  the program can be multi-faceted and include a variety of activities (with only
  one AmeriCorps component). Based on your description, it sounds like the VISTA
  member service could apply. The nomination narrative would provide more details
  on the focused effort of the VISTAs, results, etc.    <em>--Is there a word
  limit on the nominations?</em>    Answer: Yes, the nomination narrative limit
  is 500 words.    <em>--How do I submit a nomination?</em>    Answer: Log on
  to <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">www.challenge.gov</a>, and search for
  2017 Excellence in AmeriCorps Programming and Service on the homepage. Once
  you open the AmeriCorps nomination form (it’s called a Solution in <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">www.challenge.gov</a>),
  you’ll see links on the left-side of the page that include Challenge Details,
  Discussions, Solutions, Rules, and Submit Solution. Open Challenge Details and
  Rules to find all the details on the AmeriCorps awards: the eligibility criteria,
  the award categories, the nomination narrative instructions, and instructions
  for writing the nomination. The nomination narrative should be entered in the
  Description field on the Submit Solution link on the left-side of the award
  page. Enter the full name of the nominee in the Title field on the Submit Solution
  link. Open the Discussions link to ask a question about the nomination process,
  form, etc. Complete the nomination narrative and attach photos in the Description
  field of the Submit Solution link. The online system will generate an automated
  message when your Solution is submitted successfully. Be sure to check your
  email''s spam filter or clutter to confirm that you received the notification.    <em>--I
  understand that self-nominations are not eligible; however, can a program director
  nominate her own program for one of the program categories?</em>    Answer:
  A program staff member may nominate her program in one of the two program categories,
  and a program may nominate a member or alumna/us from its own program for one
  of the member categories.'

description: In honor of retired U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, an inspiring champion for national
  service, the Corporation for National and Community Service is soliciting nominations
  for the <strong>2017 Excellence in AmeriCorps Programming and Service Awards. </strong>The
  AmeriCorps Awards will be presented on September 13 at the 2017 AmeriCorps State
  and National Symposium in Arlington, VA. AmeriCorps program staff, state commissions,
  members, and alumni are invited to submit nominations.    <strong>Award categories:</strong>  <ol>    <li>Best
  new program addressing a critical priority (new is a program launched since September
  2015);</li>    <li>Most significant enhancement to an existing program;</li>    <li>Member
  with disability (ies) who significantly contributed to increasing the participation
  of other individuals with disabilities in national service; or</li>    <li>Most
  compelling member experience in either building an ethic of civic responsibility
  or having positive change in her/his life.</li>  </ol>  <strong>Eligibility:</strong>    AmeriCorps
  programs and members in AmeriCorps State, National, VISTA, or NCCC are eligible
  to be nominated for the AmeriCorps Awards. Click on the 'Rules' link on the left
  side of the page for more details on submitting a nomination.    <strong>Purpose
  of the Awards:</strong>    The Corporation's goal for these awards is to recognize
  outstanding and innovative programs and high quality and meaningful AmeriCorps service
  experiences (for current members and alumni).    Just as Sen. Harkin sought to expand
  “what worked” throughout his career, we want these awards to encourage the development
  and expansion of best practices in national service programming, improved project
  development, and increase the value of the AmeriCorps member experience to help
  tackle the country’s most pressing human and environmental needs through service.
   With emphases on engaging individuals with disabilities in service, program innovation
  and enhancements, and compelling AmeriCorps member experiences, the awards reflect
  the depth of impact of the national service field on the communities served and
  the individuals serving.    These awards will allow the Corporation for National
  and Community Service to share excellent program strategies and models with the
  national service field and the general public so that individuals, nonprofits, government
  agencies, schools, and more will be aware of the excellent and diverse range of
  national service programs across the country.    <em><strong>To submit a nomination,
  click on the Rules link on the left side of the page for instructions, frequently
  asked questions, and more.</strong></em>
