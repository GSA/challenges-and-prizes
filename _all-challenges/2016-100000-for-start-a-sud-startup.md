rules: <strong>Rules for Participating in the Challenge</strong>    The Challenge
  is open to any Founder 18 years of age or older. No prior startup experience
  is necessary. A Founder may be (i) an entity or (ii) an individual or group
  of individuals (i.e., a team assembled with the purpose of participating in
  this Challenge).  <ul>    <li>To be eligible to win a prize under this Challenge,
  an individual or entity shall be a citizen or permanent resident of the United
  States.</li>    <li>By participating in this Challenge, each Founder (whether
  participating singly or in a group) or entity retains title and full ownership
  in and to their submission and each participant expressly reserves all intellectual
  property rights (e.g., copyright) in their submission.</li>    <li>Scientists
  working on the projects that are directly applicable or adaptable to benefit
  the SUD field, NIDA’s mission area, are especially encouraged to apply. A team
  can also include engineers, IT, business or other professionals in the biomedical
  science/health care field.</li>    <li>Winners are encouraged to submit the
  minimum viable proof (MVP) report 6 months after the prize payment.</li>  </ul>  For
  more information about the Rules for Participation, go to    <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-13/pdf/2016-13936.pdf">https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-13/pdf/2016-13936.pdf</a>    &nbsp;    <strong>Submission
  Requirements</strong>    Each submission for this Challenge requires a complete
  “Submission Package.” The Submission Package includes a 4-page written proposal
  describing an idea and 5-min video introducing the team. Both the idea and the
  Founders will be evaluated.    <em><strong>In the proposal:</strong></em>  <ol>    <li>Describe
  your research idea that would further an understanding of neurobiology as it
  relates to SUD and that is intended to be the basis for a successful start-up.
  (1 page)</li>    <li>Convince the Challenge reviewers of your technical competence
  as a biomedical scientist. Be brief, selective and persuasive. Do not use the
  NIH Bibliographic Sketch format. (0.5 page)</li>    <li>Describe, in as many
  details as possible, what the prototype of your product would look like. Then,
  walk the Challenge reviewers through the typical use of the product, using simple
  terms and instructions. (1.5 pages)</li>    <li>Explain the methods you will
  use (how, when, where, whom) to determine whether the product is needed by the
  target audience and whether that audience would be willing to pay for the product.
  (1 page)</li>  </ol>  The proposal must consist of a PDF file with at least
  1 inch margins and no more than four (4) pages long. Font size must be no smaller
  than 11 point Arial. All submissions must be in English. The Contestants must
  not use HHS’s logo or official seal or the logo of NIH or NIDA in the submissions,
  and must not claim federal government endorsement.    A brief video (link to
  YouTube) must be no longer than five (5) minutes. If the Challenge submission
  is from the team of Founders, the entire team must participate in the submitted
  video.    <strong><em>In the YouTube video:</em></strong>  <ul>    <li>Tell
  NIDA something, in one minute or less, that can illustrate the drive or the
  desire of each founder to develop a product that would further an understanding
  of neurobiology as it relates to SUD and that is intended to be the basis for
  a successful start-up.</li>    <li>Tell NIDA something about each founder that
  shows a high level of scientific and entrepreneurial ability.</li>    <li>Tell
  NIDA something about each founder that shows a high level of perseverance and
  grit.</li>    <li>Tell NIDA about a time when your great idea was rejected.
  What was your response?</li>    <li>Tell NIDA how you design scientific experiments
  in general.</li>  </ul>

  on Drug Abuse (NIDA), one of the components of the National Institutes of Health
  (NIH), announces the “$100,000 for Start a SUD Startup” Challenge. The Challenge
  goal is to support research ideas that would further an understanding of neurobiology
  as it relates to Substance Use Disorders (SUD) and that are intended to be the basis
  for the development of a new and potentially successful start-up. NIDA hopes that
  participation in the contest will enable scientists to test the hypothesis that
  their research idea can be fostered into a biotech startup, and that eventually
  any newly created startups will contribute to the pool of innovative small business
  companies that can successfully compete for NIDA’s Small Business Innovation Research
  (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding. Each Challenge winner
  will receive $10,000. The Challenge total purse is up to $100,000.</p><p>    <strong>CHALLENGE
  DESCRIPTION</strong>    NIDA is excited to announce the first competition for biomedical
  scientists with the goal to support research ideas that can be fostered into a biotech
  startup.  NIDA envisions that eventually any newly created startups will contribute
  to the pool of innovative small business companies that can successfully compete
  for NIDA’s Small Business funding (SBIR/STTR Programs). We welcome all ideas related
  to substance use disorders (SUD).</p><p>    In 2016, NIDA will award up to <strong>$100,000
  in prizes to up to 10 winners of the contest, $10,000 each.</strong>    Are you
  a biomedical scientist who believes that he/she has an idea for a biotech start-up?
  This Challenge is unique because NIDA intends to fund the “would be” startup Founders
  much earlier than most investors, incubators, or traditional modes of research funding
  (e.g. small business grants). </p><p>   What does it take to participate in the Challenge?
  The team or an individual must have a research idea. The research “idea” is the
  product that your future startup will offer. Here, the term startup “product” is
  used in its broadest definition. Product is any source of value for the people who
  become customers. Services, subscriptions, software as a service (SaaS), physical/tangible
  products, aggregations, etc. could all provide value and thus be considered startup
  products. The startup product could be the result of novel scientific discoveries,
  repurposing an existing technology for a new use, extending a research observation
  into a different area, devising a new business model or distribution/delivery channel
  that unlocks value currently concealed, or simply bringing a product or service
  to previously underserved set of customers. The Founder (the teams or an individual)
  must demonstrate through the Submission the passion, drive, discipline, ability
  to work collaboratively and willingness to push forward under conditions of extreme
  business uncertainty.  </p><p>  The winners of this Challenge are encouraged to use the
  prize funds to develop a minimum viable proof (MVP) as quickly as possible and to
  obtain customer feedback to discover if MVP meets the customer needs. If the product
  prototype is successfully validated, winners are encouraged to create or further
  advance their biotech startup no later than 6 months after the prize is awarded.
  Post Challenge, as with all other NIH grant applicants, NIDA staff will provide
  dedicated assistance and guidance about the NIH grant submission process, including
  submissions for the SBIR/STTR grants. </p><p>   The research idea must be broad enough
  to address multiple conditions, diseases, or indications consistent with SUD or
  be specific for prevention and treatments of SUD. For example, if your idea can
  only work for cancer or diabetes, entering this Challenge is not appropriate. However,
  if the plan is to test an idea for a research tool that would further an understanding
  of neurobiology or epigenetics to progress faster and with greater fidelity, entering
  this Challenge is appropriate. </p><p>   For the Federal Register Notice of the “$100,000
  for Start a SUD Startup” Challenge, go to    <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-13/pdf/2016-13936.pdf">https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-13/pdf/2016-13936.pdf</a>  </p>'
