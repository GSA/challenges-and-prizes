description: 'PHASE II is now open for the Medicare Program--Merit Based Incentive
  Payment System (MIPS) Mobile Challenge.    Winners from Phase I will be publically
  announced soon. All applicants that did not win in Phase I are permitted to compete
  for Phase II.    <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Datapalooza-Presentation-Updated-7-11-15.pdf">Datapalooza
  Presentation Updated 7-11-15</a>    Updated Dates  <ul>    <li>October 15: Deadline
  for Phase II Submissions</li>    <li>November 15: HHS announces grand prize winner</li>  </ul>  The
  Challenge:  <ul>    <li>CMS recently issued a proposed rule that will change the
  way Medicare physicians are paid for giving quality care through the Quality Payment
  Program (QPP)</li>    <li>This challenge will focus on solving the problem that
  many of the 1.2 Million Clinicians and their staff will face – the ability to easily
  access information that is relevant to enable successful reporting in the new Merit
  Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) program.</li>  </ul>  Why this Challenge?  <ul>    <li>Many
  small practice and solo clinicians along with their staff may be unaware of the
  program, what it means for them, key dates, or how to successfully participate</li>    <li>Clinicians
  that are aware of the program still need to know and understand when things are
  changing</li>    <li>The Quality Payment Program offers many options that clinicians
  will need to successfully navigate</li>    <li>Different clinicians may have different
  needs and motivations for their involvement</li>  </ul>  Our Goal:    Engagement
  &amp; Education  <ul>    <li>To help clinicians and their support teams <b>understand</b>
  the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS), the <b>benefits</b> of participation,
  and how they can <b>move their </b>practice toward quality based care.</li>  </ul>  Potential
  Types of Users/Customers of the solution:  <ul>    <li>Physicians, Nurse Practitioners,
  Physician Assistants  <ul>    <li>Board and diverse practice setting and specialty
  focus</li>  </ul>  </li>    <li>APM Entities</li>    <li>Non-clinical staff (e.g.
  Office Managers/Practice Managers/Administrators)</li>    <li>Registries</li>    <li>EHR
  Vendors</li>    <li>Quality Analysts</li>  </ul>  *Contact us if you need to be
  connected to potential users in your area.    Background:    The Medicare Access
  and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (Pub. L. 114‑10, enacted April 16, 2015) (MACRA)
  requires the Secretary to establish a new Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS)
  program, which will assist the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)
  in accelerating the transition from the traditional fee-for-service payment model
  to a system that rewards health care providers for value rather than volume of services
  provided. The MIPS program combines parts of the Physician Quality Reporting System,
  the Value Modifier (VM or Value-based Payment Modifier), and the Medicare Electronic
  Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program into one single program that assesses the
  performance of MIPS eligible clinicians based on four performance categories: (1)
  Quality, (2) Resource use, (3) Clinical practice improvement activities, and (4)
  Meaningful use of certified EHR technology. This program has the potential of impacting
  1.2 million MIPS clinicians.    One of the most important aspects and challenges
  of our program is educating and providing outreach to the potential 1.2 million
  MIPS clinicians. Feedback we have received from our customers/end users is that
  they want more real-time information and access to assistance so they can successfully
  report to our programs. Therefore, we are launching a MIPS mobile challenge to find
  innovative ways of improving communication to educate physicians, support staff,
  health organization leadership, data vendors, and others impacted parties. Due to
  the multiple user types and facets of the MIPS program we are looking at utilizing
  a mobile platform, which could be a mobile site or application to determine how
  to best keep our customers/end users informed and meet their specific needs. We
  also want to provide the capability to access assistance to help MIPS clinicians
  learn and get help with specific areas. This challenge has the potential to make
  a significant impact as not only are there 1.2 million MIPS clinicians but also
  millions of people who support the success of these MIPS clinicians. Having key
  information and access to the right support at the right time reduces burden and
  provides increased satisfaction for the MIPS clinicians and their supporting entities.    Phase
  II will focus on the integration of any features from Phase 1, and user experience
  testing. During this phase, the participants must submit the object and source code,
  as well as a detailed description showing that the output meets section 508 compliance
  per the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce
  Investment Act of 1998 (Pub. L. 105-220, enacted August 7, 1998)(WIA) including
  at least instructions on how to install and operate, and system requirements for
  running the mobile platform. Participants may submit, as part of the submission,
  additional software documentation, if they believe it provides a more complete description
  of the mobile platforms.'
