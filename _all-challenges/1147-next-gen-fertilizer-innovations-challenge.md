  #### Background


  Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers facilitate the growth of crops, including corn, at yields that provide sustained global food production. However, fertilizers applied without consideration of the appropriate rate, timing, source, and method, can have harmful effects on the environment and human health. “Enhanced Efficiency Fertilizer” (EEF) is a term for new formulations that control fertilizer release or alter reactions that reduce nutrient losses to the environment. EEFs and other next generation product technology innovations may be an important addition to a system of conservation practices that help reduce the impacts from row crop agriculture on the environment, while maintaining or increasing agricultural productivity and profitability.


  #### Challenge Details


  To help mitigate potential adverse environmental effects, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is partnering with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to launch the Joint EPA-USDA Partnership and Competition on Next Gen Fertilizers to Advance Agricultural Sustainability in the United States. Along with EPA and USDA, the competition is in collaboration with The Fertilizer Institute (TFI), the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA).


  This Partnership is being coordinated with input from stakeholders such as corn grower representatives, fertilizer companies, university and government researchers, and environmental and industry NGOs. This competition includes two challenges which aim to accelerate the development and use of existing and new product technologies that are affordable to reduce the environmental impacts of U.S. corn production. The results of the Partnership may ultimately be leveraged to improve production of other crops under a range of environmental conditions in the U.S. and abroad. 


  **Next Gen Fertilizer Innovation Challenge:** This Challenge aims to identify concepts for novel technologies for fertilizers and other product technology innovations that can reduce the environmental effects from modern agriculture while maintaining or increasing crop yields. Submissions to the Next Gen Fertilizer Innovation Challenge may include technologies that are not currently on the market or technology concepts that are not traditional EEFs and not in commercial use as a fertilizer.


  For the challenge dealing with existing product technologies, go to the [EEFs: Environmental and Agronomic Challenge](https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/eefs-environmental-agronomic-challenge/).

  #### Judging Panel


  A panel of subject matter experts selected by EPA, USDA and the Challenge collaborators will judge submissions based on pre-defined scoring criteria. The panel will initially screen submissions for completeness and relevance. The selected eligible applications will then be judged using the criteria specified below. Judges will be selected based on several criteria, including their technical expertise (e.g. chemistry, agronomy, microbiology, biogeochemistry, ecology), geography (e.g. Midwest, South, etc.), associations with land grant universities, sectoral experience (e.g. farming, academia, government, industry), and diversity. All judges will be required to sign Conflict of Interest (COI) agreement to ensure unbiased reviews, and Non-Disclosure agreements to ensure confidentiality of any CBI. All persons or entities that submit a solution will be notified as to the status of their submission and a high-level evaluation. Decisions cannot be contested.  


  #### Judging Criteria


  The Challenge seeks to identify next-gen technologies, such as enhanced efficiency fertilizers (EEFs) and other innovative amendment or product-based technologies aimed at enhancing nutrient use efficiency to reduce the environmental effects from row crop agriculture while maintaining or increasing farmer productivity and profitability. Potential solutions include, but need not be constrained to, traditional soil amendments like EEFs, and may include a range of other approaches.


  Any proposed solution must address the following **Technical Requirements** to be considered for a full award. Solutions that meet some but not all of the criteria may be eligible to compete for a partial award.


  **Solution Must Have:**


  1. Must **improve environmental performance** by reducing losses of N (and/or P) to the environment through any combination of reduced NH3 volatilization, N2O emission, N runoff or leaching, P runoff or P leaching, larger reductions will receive high ratings;

  2. Must **improve agronomic performance** by not reducing yield or increasing net farm costs in terms of return on investment (ROI), larger improvements will receive higher ratings;

  3. Must be applicable for use on corn in the United States;

  4. Must not be an EEF already on the market or near-market;

  5. Must ultimately be compatible with current agricultural machinery and practices used for common large scale production such as planters, fertilizer applicators or tillage equipment.


  **Nice to Have:**


  1. Is applicable to other U.S. or global crops and soils;

  2. Does not leave toxic residues on or in the soil following use;

  3. Has a short timeline to market;

  4. Addresses more than one of the loss pathways identified above.


  #### Scoring Overview


  Within performance areas, there are additional criteria that will be evaluated. For example, there are five environmental and three agronomic criteria:


  * Environmental performance: 35 points

    * Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of N leaching/runoff: 7 points
    * Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of P leaching/runoff: 7 points 
    * Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of NH3 volatilization: 7 points
    * Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of N2O emissions: 7 points
    * No toxic residue left on the field or in the runoff or leachate: 7 points (For the purposes of this Challenge, “toxic residues” refers to prevalent and biologically active degradates formed from decomposition (via either biotic and abiotic processes) of the product in the environment. Please include the names and unique CAS numbers (if available) for any active and inactive ingredients of the solution and its degradants. Toxicity and prevalence can be described by a number of means, including existing eco-toxicology and environmental fate studies, summaries from either the [EPA CompTox Chemicals Dashboard](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard) or the [EPA ECOTOX Knowledgebase](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ecotox/), or whether the constituent chemicals are already listed under the [EPA Safer Chemical Ingredients List](https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/safer-ingredients). Although this criteria does not pertain to inhibitor effects on target organisms (e.g., soil bacteria), which are toxic by design, it does pertain to any decomposition byproducts of inhibitors and other potential solutions, and effects that may occur for non-target organisms)
  * Agronomic performance: 35 points 

    * Yield relative to conventional fertilizer: 15 points
    * Return on investment (ROI): 10 points
    * Compatibility with existing supply chain machinery and practices: 10 points
  * Other performance criteria: 20 points

    * Addresses multiple loss pathways: 10 points
    * Applicability to other crops and environmental conditions: 5 points
    * Shorter timeline to market: 5 points
  * Expert discretion points: 10 points


  The Judging Panel will assign points to metrics and criteria based on the rubric above and their combined expert judgement given the degree of information submitted in the solutions. This “scorecard” will be made available to the Solver at the announcement of Stage 1 winners. 


  The example rubric above is for a solution that addresses N and P. For solutions that address only one nutrient (e.g. N), the possible points for the other nutrient (e.g. P) will be zeroed out such that the total points possible will be less than 100 (i.e. 90 points possible for N-only solution, 80 total points possible for P-only solution). 


  **Following are the qualities of an ideal solution:**


  1. Compatible with existing corn farming machinery and practices;

  2. Reduces N and P leaching by 45% or more;

  3. Reduces NH3 volatilization by 25% or more;

  4. Reduces N2O emissions by 25% or more;

  5. Is estimated to be a net profit for farmers (i.e. the revenue from yield increases offset the up-front cost increases for the new technology);

  6. Has good environmental and agronomic performance under a range of environmental conditions;

  7. Is potentially applicable to other crops and countries.

  * Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of N leaching/runoff: 7 points
  * Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of P leaching/runoff: 7 points 
  * Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of NH3 volatilization: 7 points
  * Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of N2O emissions: 7 points
  * No toxic residue left on the field or in the runoff or leachate: 7 points (For the purposes of this Challenge, “toxic residues” refers to prevalent and biologically active degradates formed from decomposition (via either biotic and abiotic processes) of the product in the environment. Please include the names and unique CAS numbers (if available) for any active and inactive ingredients of the solution and its degradants. Toxicity and prevalence can be described by a number of means, including existing eco-toxicology and environmental fate studies, summaries from either the [EPA CompTox Chemicals Dashboard](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard) or the [EPA ECOTOX Knowledgebase](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ecotox/), or whether the constituent chemicals are already listed under the [EPA Safer Chemical Ingredients List](https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/safer-ingredients). Although this criteria does not pertain to inhibitor effects on target organisms (e.g., soil bacteria), which are toxic by design, it does pertain to any decomposition byproducts of inhibitors and other potential solutions, and effects that may occur for non-target organisms)
* Agronomic performance: 35 points 

  * Yield relative to conventional fertilizer: 15 points
  * Return on investment (ROI): 10 points
  * Compatibility with existing supply chain machinery and practices: 10 points
* Other performance criteria: 20 points

  * Addresses multiple loss pathways: 10 points
  * Applicability to other crops and environmental conditions: 5 points
  * Shorter timeline to market: 5 points
* Expert discretion points: 10 points

The Judging Panel will assign points to metrics and criteria based on the rubric above and their combined expert judgement given the degree of information submitted in the solutions. This “scorecard” will be made available to the Solver at the announcement of Stage 1 winners. 

The example rubric above is for a solution that addresses N and P. For solutions that address only one nutrient (e.g. N), the possible points for the other nutrient (e.g. P) will be zeroed out such that the total points possible will be less than 100 (i.e. 90 points possible for N-only solution, 80 total points possible for P-only solution). 

**Following are the qualities of an ideal solution:**

1. Compatible with existing corn farming machinery and practices;
2. Reduces N and P leaching by 45% or more;
3. Reduces NH3 volatilization by 25% or more;
4. Reduces N2O emissions by 25% or more;
5. Is estimated to be a net profit for farmers (i.e. the revenue from yield increases offset the up-front cost increases for the new technology);
6. Has good environmental and agronomic performance under a range of environmental conditions;
7. Is potentially applicable to other crops and countries.
