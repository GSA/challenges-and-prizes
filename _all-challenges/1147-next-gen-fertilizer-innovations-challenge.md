  #### Background


  Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers facilitate the growth of crops, including corn, at yields that provide sustained global food production. However, fertilizers applied without consideration of the appropriate rate, timing, source, and method, can have harmful effects on the environment and human health. “Enhanced Efficiency Fertilizer” (EEF) is a term for new formulations that control fertilizer release or alter reactions that reduce nutrient losses to the environment. EEFs and other product technology innovations may be an important addition to a system of conservation practices that help reduce the impacts from row crop agriculture on the environment, while maintaining or increasing agricultural productivity and profitability.


  #### The Challenges 


  To help mitigate these adverse effects, EPA is partnering with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to launch the Joint EPA-USDA Partnership and Competition on Next Gen Fertilizers to Advance Agricultural Sustainability in the United States. Along with EPA and USDA, the competition is in collaboration with The Fertilizer Institute (TFI), the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA).


  This Partnership is being coordinated with input from stakeholders such as corn grower representatives, fertilizer companies, university researchers, and environmental and industry NGOs. This competition includes two challenges which aim to accelerate the development and use of existing and new product technologies that are affordable to reduce the environmental impacts of U.S. corn production. The results of the Partnership may ultimately be leveraged to improve production of other crops under a range of environmental conditions in the U.S. and abroad.


  The Next Gen Fertilizer Innovation Challenge: This Challenge aims to identify concepts for novel technologies for fertilizers that can reduce the environmental effects from modern agriculture while maintaining or increasing crop yields. Submissions to the Next Gen Challenge are not near-market and may include technologies that are not traditional EEFs.

  **Judging Criteria**


  The Challenge seeks to identify enhanced efficiency fertilizers (EEFs) and other innovative amendment or product-based technologies aimed at enhancing nutrient use efficiency to reduce the environmental effects from row crop agriculture while maintaining or increasing farmer productivity and profitability. Potential solutions include but need not be constrained to traditional soil amendments like EEFs, and may include a range of other approaches.  


  Any proposed solution must address the following **Technical Requirements** to be considered for a full award. Concepts that meet some but not all of the criteria will be eligible to compete for a partial award.


  **Must have:**


  1. Must improve environmental performance by reducing losses of N (and/or P) to the environment through any combination of reduced NH3 volatilization, N2O emission, N runoff or leaching, P runoff or P leaching, larger reductions will receive high ratings;

  2. Must improve agronomic performance by not reducing yield or increasing net farm costs in terms of return on investment (ROI), larger improvements will receive higher ratings;

  3. Must be applicable for use on corn in the United States;

  4. Must not be already on the market or near-market;

  5. Must ultimately be compatible with current agricultural machinery and practices used for common large scale production such as planters, fertilizer applicators or tillage equipment.


  **Nice to have:**


  1. Is applicable to other U.S. or global crops and soils;

  2. Does not leave toxic residues on or in the soil following use (Here, “residues” means byproducts after the decomposition of the technology in the environment. Toxicity can be described by a number of means, including existing studies, summaries from either the [EPA Chemical Dashboard](<1. https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard>) or the [EPA Ecotox Knowledge base](<1. https://cfpub.epa.gov/ecotox/index.cfm>), or whether the constituent chemicals are already listed under the [EPA’s Safer Chemical Ingredients List](<1. https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/safer-ingredients>) (e.g., there are 63 polymers listed as safer alternatives). Although this criteria does not pertain to inhibitor effects on target organisms (e.g., soil bacteria), which are toxic by design, it does pertain to any decomposition byproducts of inhibitors and other potential solutions, and effects that may occur for non-target organisms);

  3. Has a short timeline to market;

  4. Addresses more than one of the loss pathways identified above.


  **Following are the qualities of an ideal solution:**


  1. Compatible with existing corn farming machinery and practices;

  2. Reduces N and P leaching by 45% or more;

  3. Reduces NH3 volatilization by 25% or more;

  4. Reduces N2O emissions by 25% or more;

  5. Is estimated to be a net profit for farmers (i.e. the revenue from yield increases offset the up-front cost increases for the new technology);

  6. Has good environmental and agronomic performance under a range of environmental conditions;

  7. Is potentially applicable to other crops and countries. 


  **Project Deliverables:**


  The submitted proposal must be 10 pages or less (excluding references), 8.5 x 11 inch page, 12 point Times New Roman font or greater, single spaced, and one-inch margins. The proposal should include the following headings and content:


  1. Executive Summary: Overall description of the proposed solution (500 words);

  2. Detailed Description of the Proposed Solution: This would include background on the approach (which need not be a traditional EEF), including any physical, chemical, biological, ecological, or biogeochemical properties in the soil under various climatic and soil moisture conditions. This should also include a description of how the solution may decompose in the environment and into what chemicals. 

  3. Environmental performance: A quantitative summary (including any relevant graphs or tables) of any published or unpublished results of environmental performance, including comparisons of rates of loss relative to conventional fertilizer for N (e.g. leaching, runoff, ammonia volatilization, nitrous oxide emissions), and P (e.g. leaching, runoff) if relevant;

  4. Agronomic performance: A quantitative summary (including any relevant graphs or tables) of any published or unpublished results of agronomic performance, including yields under various conditions, rates of growth, kernel production, and net cost (e.g. return on investment, ROI) relative to conventional fertilizer practices;

  5. Compatibility. Describe how your technology may be integrated into existing farming machinery and practices (e.g. transport, storage, application) to the level of specificity possible given the degree of technological maturity. 

  6. Confidential Business Information (CBI): Clear statements on any CBI to be withheld from the submission, or included in the submission but to be withheld from either the judging panel or the public;
