  The Waves to Water prize is a 4-Stage competition that offers up to $2.5
  million in cash prizes, with a goal to demonstrate small, modular,
  cost-competitive desalination systems that use the power of ocean waves to
  provide clean drinking water for disaster recovery and for remote and coastal
  communities.

  In June, 2019, the U.S. Department of Energy Water Power Technologies Office
  launched a prize to develop wave energy powered desalination systems. The
  Waves to Water Prize is a 4-Stage, $2.5M contest to accelerate the development
  of small, modular, wave-powered desalination systems capable of providing
  potable drinking water in disaster relief scenarios and remote coastal
  locations.


  This is the second stage of this prize, the DESIGN Stage, which offers
  competitors up to $800,000 in cash prizes. This DESIGN Stage asks competitors
  to submit a plan and provide detailed modeling of the system.


  The Prize aims to attract dedicated teams of highly capable individuals and
  provide them with sufficient incentives so that they will advance their
  technologies through completion of the prize. While the technology development
  goals of the prize are specifically tailored to address the unique
  circumstances around disaster response or remote coastal community water
  needs, the purpose is also to advance technologies that could have broader
  applications for wave energy and desalination technologies. Through the
  competition, participants will develop skills and knowledge that will
  contribute to a general improvement and proliferation of wave power and
  desalination technologies.
