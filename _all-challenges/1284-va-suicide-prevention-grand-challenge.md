  **We are seeking bold innovations to save lives and reduce Veteran suicide by
  at least 10%.** Recognizing that there are other entities, including but not
  limited to academia, industry, nonprofits, other government agencies,
  community partners, and Veteran-service organizations, engaged in both
  identifying innovation solutions as well as being direct service providers,
  the VA Suicide Prevention Grand Challenge (VA SPGC) serves as a pipeline to
  rapidly source suicide prevention innovations from non-VA entities ([Report
  links substance use and suicide among Veterans, offers support, Vantage
  Point](https://blogs.va.gov/VAntage/94100/report-links-substance-use-suicide-veterans-offers-support/).)


  **Challenge Objective**


  The following are potential areas, among several, that VA SPGC may explore:


  * **Digital Life Data & Early Warning Systems**—Innovators are sought who can develop scalable and interoperable suicide risk prevention analytics that are ethical and clinically valid in an effort to enhance real-time prevention and responsive interventions that are local and accessible for Veterans in VHA care as well as Veterans outside of VHA care and in crisis.

  * **Improved Access to Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) Services**— As VCL faces the opportunities that [988 adoption](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-365165A1.pdf) will bring to our mission of providing world class crisis care to Veterans, we are looking for innovative solutions that can improve efficiency and quality during expected increase in volume. Innovators are sought who can leverage artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing to better understand patterns, unknown signals, and unexpected relationships. This objective will also incorporate process flow innovations that use technology and non-technology solutions for crisis line staffing and operational improvements.

  * **Firearm suicide prevention and lethal means safety**— In 2019 the majority of firearm deaths in the United States ([Firearm Violence Prevention, Violence Prevention Injury Center, CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/firearms/fastfact.html)) were suicides and among Veterans, nearly 70% of suicide deaths in 2019 were by firearm ([2021 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report (va.gov)](https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/docs/data-sheets/2021/2021-National-Veteran-Suicide-Prevention-Annual-Report-FINAL-9-8-21.pdf)). We will seek innovative solutions to prevent firearm suicide. 


  **Solution Framework**


  Following are additional parameters for consideration in developing innovations:


  * **Target Community**—Innovations shall meet the needs of service members transitioning out of the military, Veterans enrolled in VA healthcare or receiving VA benefits and Veterans not enrolled in VA healthcare or benefits.

  * **Prevention/Intervention Implementation Timing**—The prevention/intervention innovation can provide solutions addressing immediate impact (Now); near-term impact (Next) or long-term impact (Later) efforts.

  * **Health Equity**—Innovations should account for specific subpopulations such as women Veterans, new Veterans (those who are planning to transition or have transitioned in the last 1-3 years), Veterans ages 55 and over, Veterans ages 18-34, and American Indian, Alaska Native, Black, African American Veterans, Asian American, Latin or Hispanic Veterans and LGBTQ+ Veterans.


  **Background:**


  Suicide remains a national public health concern—45,861 American adults died from suicide in 2019, including 6,261 U.S. Veterans. While suicide can affect all Americans, it has been shown to have a disproportionate impact on the Veteran community. Hope serves as a key and necessary anchor to strengthen Veterans amidst numerous life circumstances. In a similar manner, hope must imbue the overall suicide prevention mission, anchoring it amidst mission challenges and circumstances. The 2021 [National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report (va.gov)](https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/docs/data-sheets/2021/2021-National-Veteran-Suicide-Prevention-Annual-Report-FINAL-9-8-21.pdf) provides the most comprehensive analysis of Veteran suicide data. Regarding lethal means involved in suicide deaths among Veterans, firearms accounted for 70.2% of male Veteran suicides in 2019 (up from 69.6% in 2018) and 49.8% of female Veteran suicides in 2019 (up from 41.1% in 2018). The proportion of firearm-related Veteran suicide deaths increased in 2019 compared to 2001.

  **Business Relationship**


  The intent of the VA SPGC is to encourage people to suggest their ideas, uses and approaches to VA and/or the Administrator for use by VA and/or the Administrator without compensation. Participation in the VA SPGC and acceptance of the award does not create an obligation on VA’s and/or the Administrator’s part to enter any business relationship or to sign any commercial agreement in the future. You are free to discuss your entry with other parties and you are free to contract with any third party provided you do not sign any agreement or undertake any obligations that conflict with any agreement that you have entered into or subsequently enter into with VA regarding your entry. Any such third-party agreement does not obligate VA, and that contestant/participant is not authorized to obligate or represent that VA is so obligated.


  **Privacy**


  By entering the VA SPGC, you acknowledge and agree that VA and/or the Administrator will have access to and use of any personal data provided in connection with your entry for purposes as described in these Official Rules and as governed by VA Privacy Policy posted on the VA website https://www.oprm.va.gov/privacy/privacy_principles.aspx.

A breach of any warranty set out above will result in the corresponding entry being invalidated. In addition, each contestant (jointly and severally where an entry is submitted by more than one person and/or entity) agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless VA and/or the Administrator against all loss, damages and costs (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and costs) incurred by VA and/or the Administrator arising from breach of any such warranty. 


  **Challenge Subject to Applicable Law** 


  All VA SPGC phases and participation are subject to all applicable U.S. federal laws, state and local laws and regulations. Participation constitutes each contestant's full and unconditional agreement to these Official Rules and administrative decisions, which are final and binding in all matters related to the Challenge. Eligibility for a prize award is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements set forth herein. This notice is not an obligation of funds; the final award of prizes is contingent upon the availability of appropriations. 


  Contestants are responsible for checking applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction(s) before participating in the prize Challenge to ensure that their participation is legal. VA shall not, by virtue of conducting the VA SPGC be responsible for compliance by contestants in the VA SPGC with Federal law including licensing, export control, and nonproliferation laws, and related regulations. Individuals entering on behalf of or representing a company, institution or other legal entity are responsible for confirming that their entry does not violate any policies of that company, institution, or legal entity. 


  **Resolution of Disputes** 


  VA is solely responsible for administrative decisions, which are final and binding in all matters related to the VA SPGC. 


  In the event of a dispute as to any registration, the authorized account holder of the email address used to register will be deemed to be the contestant. The “authorized account holder” is the natural person or legal entity assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Contestants and potential winners may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder. 


  **Publicity** 


  The winners of these prizes (collectively, “Winners”) will be featured on the VA website, newsletters, social media, and other outreach materials.

  **Payments** 


  The prize Challenge winners will be paid prizes directly from VA. Prior to payment, winners will be required to verify eligibility. The verification process with the agency includes providing the full legal name, tax identification number or social security number, routing number and banking account to which the prize money can be deposited directly. 

  All cash prizes awarded to contestants by VA are subject to tax liabilities, and no withholding will be assessed by VA on behalf of the contestant claiming a cash prize. 


  **Liability and Insurance** 


  By participating in the VA SPGC, you agree to release, indemnify and hold harmless, the Sponsor and/or the Administrator and their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising and promotions agencies, and each of their respective agents, representatives, officers, directors, shareholders, and employees (collectively, “Sponsor Entities” and/or “Administrator Entities”) from and against any injuries, losses, damages, claims, actions and any liability of any kind (including attorneys’ fees) resulting from or arising out of your participation in, association with, or submission to the VA SPGC (including any claims alleging that your entry infringes, misappropriates, or violates any third party's patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark or other intellectual property or proprietary rights). The Sponsor and/or the Administrator are not responsible for any technical failures related to communication or submission failures, such as unavailable networks or server connections; other failures related to hardware, software, viruses, or incomplete, late, or misdirected entries. Any compromise to the fair, proper and legal conduct of the VA SPGC may result in the disqualification of an entry, the termination of the Challenge, or other remedial or legal action at the sole discretion of the Sponsor and/or the Administrator. The Sponsor and/or the Administrator reserve the right to cancel, terminate, modify or suspend the Challenge in the event that the VA SPGC is not capable of running as planned and the Sponsor and/or the Administrator may choose to judge only valid entries received prior to cancelation or termination or to cancel the Challenge in its entirety. By entering the SPGC, contestants agree that the Sponsor and/or the Administrator, their promotion partners, related companies, agencies, advertisers and their respective employees or officers (collectively, “Releases”) shall not be liable for any claims, injuries, costs or losses of any kind resulting, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, from the awarding, delivery, acceptance, use, misuse, possession, loss or misdirection of any Award or participation in the VA SPGC or in any activity or travel related thereto. 


  The Sponsor and/or the Administrator, in their sole discretion, reserve the right to disqualify any person tampering with the entry process or the operation of the SPGC website or otherwise violating these Official Rules. In the event of a dispute regarding the identity of the person submitting an entry, the entry will be deemed to be submitted by the person in whose name the applicable e-mail account is registered. By entering, you agree to be bound by these Official Rules and acknowledge that all decisions of the Sponsor and/or the Administrator, and their respective agents and representatives are final and binding in all respects. 


  **No Obligation** 


  You acknowledge that multiple contestants may submit entries that contain ideas, designs, concepts, approaches, or technologies similar to your entry and that the Sponsor, and/or its respective subsidiaries and business partners may already be investigating or developing technical solutions or have business activities that are related to or similar to those disclosed in your entry. You acknowledge and agree that Sponsor's actions with respect to another entry or one of its own solutions, investigations, or business activities, even if similar to your entry, shall not create any liability, of any kind, by Sponsor to you or others. For the avoidance of doubt, you acknowledge that Sponsor is not obligated to take any action whatsoever regarding your entry.\

# Description

**We are seeking bold innovations to save lives and reduce Veteran suicide by at least 10%.** Recognizing that there are other entities, including but not limited to academia, industry, nonprofits, other government agencies, community partners, and Veteran-service organizations, engaged in both identifying innovation solutions as well as being direct service providers, the VA Suicide Prevention Grand Challenge (VA SPGC) serves as a pipeline to rapidly source suicide prevention innovations from non-VA entities ([Report links substance use and suicide among Veterans, offers support, Vantage Point](https://blogs.va.gov/VAntage/94100/report-links-substance-use-suicide-veterans-offers-support/).)

**Challenge Objective**

The following are potential areas, among several, that VA SPGC may explore:

* **Digital Life Data & Early Warning Systems**—Innovators are sought who can develop scalable and interoperable suicide risk prevention analytics that are ethical and clinically valid in an effort to enhance real-time prevention and responsive interventions that are local and accessible for Veterans in VHA care as well as Veterans outside of VHA care and in crisis.
* **Improved Access to Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) Services**— As VCL faces the opportunities that [988 adoption](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-365165A1.pdf) will bring to our mission of providing world class crisis care to Veterans, we are looking for innovative solutions that can improve efficiency and quality during expected increase in volume. Innovators are sought who can leverage artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing to better understand patterns, unknown signals, and unexpected relationships. This objective will also incorporate process flow innovations that use technology and non-technology solutions for crisis line staffing and operational improvements.
* **Firearm suicide prevention and lethal means safety**— In 2019 the majority of firearm deaths in the United States ([Firearm Violence Prevention, Violence Prevention Injury Center, CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/firearms/fastfact.html)) were suicides and among Veterans, nearly 70% of suicide deaths in 2019 were by firearm ([2021 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report (va.gov)](https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/docs/data-sheets/2021/2021-National-Veteran-Suicide-Prevention-Annual-Report-FINAL-9-8-21.pdf)). We will seek innovative solutions to prevent firearm suicide. 

**Solution Framework**

Following are additional parameters for consideration in developing innovations:

* **Target Community**—Innovations shall meet the needs of service members transitioning out of the military, Veterans enrolled in VA healthcare or receiving VA benefits and Veterans not enrolled in VA healthcare or benefits.
* **Prevention/Intervention Implementation Timing**—The prevention/intervention innovation can provide solutions addressing immediate impact (Now); near-term impact (Next) or long-term impact (Later) efforts.
* **Health Equity**—Innovations should account for specific subpopulations such as women Veterans, new Veterans (those who are planning to transition or have transitioned in the last 1-3 years), Veterans ages 55 and over, Veterans ages 18-34, and American Indian, Alaska Native, Black, African American Veterans, Asian American, Latin or Hispanic Veterans and LGBTQ+ Veterans.

**Background:**

Suicide remains a national public health concern—45,861 American adults died from suicide in 2019, including 6,261 U.S. Veterans. While suicide can affect all Americans, it has been shown to have a disproportionate impact on the Veteran community. Hope serves as a key and necessary anchor to strengthen Veterans amidst numerous life circumstances. In a similar manner, hope must imbue the overall suicide prevention mission, anchoring it amidst mission challenges and circumstances. The 2021 [National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report (va.gov)](https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/docs/data-sheets/2021/2021-National-Veteran-Suicide-Prevention-Annual-Report-FINAL-9-8-21.pdf) provides the most comprehensive analysis of Veteran suicide data. Regarding lethal means involved in suicide deaths among Veterans, firearms accounted for 70.2% of male Veteran suicides in 2019 (up from 69.6% in 2018) and 49.8% of female Veteran suicides in 2019 (up from 41.1% in 2018). The proportion of firearm-related Veteran suicide deaths increased in 2019 compared to 2001. 

**Key Dates**

Launch January 31, 2022 and additional key dates are forthcoming.

Your submission grants, without limitation, to VA and/or the Administrator the right to include your company name (if your entry is from a company) as a contestant on the Challenge website and in materials related to VA’s promotion of the VA SPGC. 

**Business Relationship**

The intent of the VA SPGC is to encourage people to suggest their ideas, uses and approaches to VA and/or the Administrator for use by VA and/or the Administrator without compensation. Participation in the VA SPGC and acceptance of the award does not create an obligation on VA’s and/or the Administrator’s part to enter any business relationship or to sign any commercial agreement in the future. You are free to discuss your entry with other parties and you are free to contract with any third party provided you do not sign any agreement or undertake any obligations that conflict with any agreement that you have entered into or subsequently enter into with VA regarding your entry. Any such third-party agreement does not obligate VA, and that contestant/participant is not authorized to obligate or represent that VA is so obligated.

**Privacy**

By entering the VA SPGC, you acknowledge and agree that VA and/or the Administrator will have access to and use of any personal data provided in connection with your entry for purposes as described in these Official Rules and as governed by VA Privacy Policy posted on the VA website https://www.oprm.va.gov/privacy/privacy_principles.aspx.

**Confidentiality**

Since VA and/or the Administrator do not wish to receive or hold any submitted materials “in confidence," it is agreed that, with respect to your entry, no confidential relationship or obligation of secrecy is established between VA and/or the Administrator and you, the company you represent or represented when submitting your entry, or the owner of any part of your entry or the subject matter thereof. Your entry will not be considered confidential or have any restrictions on its use. 

**Warranties**

By submitting an entry, you represent and warrant that all information in your entry and all information that you submit via the Challenge website is true and complete, that the official representative has the right and authority to submit the entry and disclose the information therein on his/her own behalf or on behalf of the persons and entities that are specified within the entry, and that the entry (both the information and materials submitted in the entry and the underlying ideas, information, technology and all materials contained in or described in the entry): (a) is the original work of the contestant(s) and representative of contestant(s) capability, or is submitted by permission with full and proper credit given within the entry; (b) does not contain confidential information or trade secrets (yours or anyone else's); (c) does not violate or infringe upon the patent rights, industrial design rights, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, rights of privacy, publicity, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights of any person or entity; (d) does not contain malicious code, such as viruses, malware, timebombs, cancelbots, worms, Trojan horses or other potentially harmful programs; (e) does not and will not violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance, rule, or regulation or any agreement with a third party; (f) does not trigger any obligation to any third party; and (g) does not contain any information (i) that contestant(s) have, or, to contestant’s(s’) knowledge, has otherwise been, provided by to any resident or citizen of any U.S. embargoed countries or to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons List or Entity List; and (ii) will not directly or indirectly violate any applicable U.S. import or export laws, including, without limitation, the International Traffic In Arms Regulations (ITAR) under 22 CFR §§ 120-130, or the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) under 15 CFR §§ 730-774. A breach of any warranty set out above will result in the corresponding entry being invalidated. In addition, each contestant (jointly and severally where an entry is submitted by more than one person and/or entity) agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless VA and/or the Administrator against all loss, damages and costs (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and costs) incurred by VA and/or the Administrator arising from breach of any such warranty.

All VA SPGC phases and participation are subject to all applicable U.S. federal laws, state and local laws and regulations. Participation constitutes each contestant's full and unconditional agreement to these Official Rules and administrative decisions, which are final and binding in all matters related to the Challenge. Eligibility for a prize award is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements set forth herein. This notice is not an obligation of funds; the final award of prizes is contingent upon the availability of appropriations. 

Contestants are responsible for checking applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction(s) before participating in the prize Challenge to ensure that their participation is legal. VA shall not, by virtue of conducting the VA SPGC be responsible for compliance by contestants in the VA SPGC with Federal law including licensing, export control, and nonproliferation laws, and related regulations.

VA is solely responsible for administrative decisions, which are final and binding in all matters related to the VA SPGC. 

In the event of a dispute as to any registration, the authorized account holder of the email address used to register will be deemed to be the contestant. The “authorized account holder” is the natural person or legal entity assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Contestants and potential winners may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder.

The winners of these prizes (collectively, “Winners”) will be featured on the VA website, newsletters, social media, and other outreach materials. 
Except where prohibited, participation in the VA SPGC constitutes each winner's consent to VA, its agents’, and any VA SPGC co-sponsors’ use of each winner’s name, likeness, photograph, voice, opinions, and/or hometown and state information for promotional purposes through any form of media, worldwide, without further permission, payment or consideration. 

**Payments** 

The prize Challenge winners will be paid prizes directly from VA. Prior to payment, winners will be required to verify eligibility. The verification process with the agency includes providing the full legal name, tax identification number or social security number, routing number and banking account to which the prize money can be deposited directly. 
All cash prizes awarded to contestants by VA are subject to tax liabilities, and no withholding will be assessed by VA on behalf of the contestant claiming a cash prize. 

**Liability and Insurance** 

By participating in the VA SPGC, you agree to release, indemnify and hold harmless, the Sponsor and/or the Administrator and their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising and promotions agencies, and each of their respective agents, representatives, officers, directors, shareholders, and employees (collectively, “Sponsor Entities” and/or “Administrator Entities”) from and against any injuries, losses, damages, claims, actions and any liability of any kind (including attorneys’ fees) resulting from or arising out of your participation in, association with, or submission to the VA SPGC (including any claims alleging that your entry infringes, misappropriates, or violates any third party's patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark or other intellectual property or proprietary rights). The Sponsor and/or the Administrator are not responsible for any technical failures related to communication or submission failures, such as unavailable networks or server connections; other failures related to hardware, software, viruses, or incomplete, late, or misdirected entries. Any compromise to the fair, proper and legal conduct of the VA SPGC may result in the disqualification of an entry, the termination of the Challenge, or other remedial or legal action at the sole discretion of the Sponsor and/or the Administrator. The Sponsor and/or the Administrator reserve the right to cancel, terminate, modify or suspend the Challenge in the event that the VA SPGC is not capable of running as planned and the Sponsor and/or the Administrator may choose to judge only valid entries received prior to cancelation or termination or to cancel the Challenge in its entirety.

You acknowledge and agree that Sponsor's actions with respect to another entry or one of its own solutions, investigations, or business activities, even if similar to your entry, shall not create any liability, of any kind, by Sponsor to you or others. For the avoidance of doubt, you acknowledge that Sponsor is not obligated to take any action whatsoever regarding your entry.\
