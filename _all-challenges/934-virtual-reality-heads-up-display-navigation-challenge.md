description: <p><strong>Submissions have been extended to 9 p.m. ET, Monday, Jan. 29.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>Join us for this exciting VR (virtual reality) prize competition using your ingenuity, software coding and VR expertise to create a concept for a heads-up display (HUD) with unimpeded visual aids.&nbsp; The result of the<strong> First Responder Virtual Reality (VR) Heads-up-Display (HUD) Navigation Challenge </strong>will support the public safety community and its stakeholders.</p>
    <p>You (the contestant) will showcase your VR skills and create a solution that helps advance User Interface (UI) technology through research.&nbsp; UI is &ldquo;the means by which a user and a technology system interact; including how users input, access, and navigate data and communications through the technology.&rdquo;&nbsp; Examples of UIs are haptic feedback mechanisms (e.g., sound, vibration), vocal commands, and visual indicators (e.g., heads-up displays). &nbsp;Historically, UI design has been broad and rarely targeted for Public Safety however, it&rsquo;s critical that first responders complete their tasks efficiently and effectively with minimum impediment.</p>
    <p>NIST Public Safety Communications Research Program is hosting this 4-stage challenge, with prize awards up to $125,000 (prizes plus travel) for the top 7 designs. In addition to the cash prize, finalists will have speaking engagements, networking opportunities, and paid travel to the 2018 PSCR Stakeholder conference. There are no fees or qualifications to enter the first stage.&nbsp; The Stage 1 winning ideas will be eligible for remaining stages of the competition. (see Official Rules) You can make a difference!&nbsp; Continue reading for contest stages and details, and <strong>enter by January 29,</strong> <strong>2018</strong>, here on Challenge.gov on the submit entry tab to the left.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; NIST will not review or consider ineligible Concept Papers. NIST makes an independent assessment of each Concept Paper based on the evaluation criteria. During the review, each subject matter expert reviewer will review entire concept papers to which they are assigned. The review is not done in sections with different reviewers responsible for different assigned sections. Therefore, it is not necessary to repeat information in every part of the concept paper. Do not include sensitive materials in the concept paper, for example personally identifiable information like social security numbers, business sensitive information like tax id numbers, etc.</p>
    <h3>CONTESTANT ELIGIBILITY:</h3>
    <p>To be eligible for the cash prizes, each contestant or team of contestants must include an individual age 18 or older at the time of entry and a U.S. citizen or permanent resident of the United States or its territories. In the case of a private entity, the business shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States or its territories.&nbsp; Contestants may not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment.&nbsp; NIST Guest Researchers, as well as direct recipients of NIST funding awards through any Center of Excellence established by NIST, are eligible to enter, but are not eligible to receive cash awards. Non-NIST Federal employees acting in their personal capacities should consult with their respective agency ethics officials to determine whether their participation in this Competition is permissible.&nbsp; Contestants, including individuals and private entities, must not have been convicted of a felony criminal violation under any Federal law within the preceding 24 months and must not have any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed, for which all judicial and administrative remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability. Contestants must not be suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded from doing business with the Federal Government.&nbsp; Multiple individuals and/or legal entities may collaborate as a group to submit a single entry and a single individual from the group must be designated as an official representative for each entry.&nbsp; That designated individual will be responsible for meeting all entry and evaluation requirements.</p>
    <h3>TEAMS:</h3>
    <p>Contest submissions can be from an individual or a team(s).

### Description


<p><strong>Submissions have been extended to 9 p.m. ET, Monday, Jan. 29.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Join us for this exciting VR (virtual reality) prize competition using your ingenuity, software coding and VR expertise to create a concept for a heads-up display (HUD) with unimpeded visual aids.&nbsp; The result of the<strong> First Responder Virtual Reality (VR) Heads-up-Display (HUD) Navigation Challenge </strong>will support the public safety community and its stakeholders.</p>
<p>You (the contestant) will showcase your VR skills and create a solution that helps advance User Interface (UI) technology through research.&nbsp; UI is &ldquo;the means by which a user and a technology system interact; including how users input, access, and navigate data and communications through the technology.&rdquo;&nbsp; Examples of UIs are haptic feedback mechanisms (e.g., sound, vibration), vocal commands, and visual indicators (e.g., heads-up displays). &nbsp;Historically, UI design has been broad and rarely targeted for Public Safety however, it&rsquo;s critical that first responders complete their tasks efficiently and effectively with minimum impediment.</p>
<p>NIST Public Safety Communications Research Program is hosting this 4-stage challenge, with prize awards up to $125,000 (prizes plus travel) for the top 7 designs. In addition to the cash prize, finalists will have speaking engagements, networking opportunities, and paid travel to the 2018 PSCR Stakeholder conference. There are no fees or qualifications to enter the first stage.&nbsp; The Stage 1 winning ideas will be eligible for remaining stages of the competition. (see Official Rules) You can make a difference!&nbsp; Continue reading for contest stages and details, and <strong>enter by January 29,</strong> <strong>2018</strong>, here on Challenge.gov on the submit entry tab to the left.</p>
