  The Office on Women’s Health (OWH) in partnership with the Centers for
  Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking innovative ways to improve
  postpartum care for Black or African American  and American Indian or Alaska
  Native (AI/AN) low-income beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid or Children’s
  Health Insurance Program (CHIP).  We are pleased to announce the **HHS
  Postpartum Equity in Care Challenge: Innovative Methods to Improve Postpartum
  Care for Black or African American and American Indian/ Alaska Native Women**,
  with an emphasis on follow-up care for conditions associated with morbidity
  and mortality in the later postpartum period, including diabetes, postpartum
  depression and/or postpartum anxiety, hypertension, and substance use
  disorders (SUD). 


  **Background/Issue:**


  Medicaid covers 42 percent of all births overall with two-thirds of births to Black or African American and AI/AN women. In addition, there are significant and persistent racial and ethnic disparities in pregnancy-related deaths—which are three to four times more common among Black or African American and AI/AN women than among White women.<sup>1</sup> More than one-half of pregnancy-related mortality occurs in the 12-month postpartum period and about one-third occurs between 7 and 365 days post-delivery.<sup>2</sup> Postpartum care is a critical opportunity to address and provide follow up for conditions associated with morbidity and mortality in the postpartum period. Yet, there are many disparities in postpartum care. For example:


  * Black or African American women have the highest risk for progression from gestational diabetes to chronic diabetes, yet have lower rates of diabetes postpartum screening.<sup>3</sup> 

  * Approximately 13 percent of postpartum women experience depression, with higher self-reported rates among women of color.<sup>4</sup> 

  * Black or African American women ages 20-44 years have more than twice the hypertension prevalence of other racial and ethnic groups.<sup>5</sup>

  * Several state Medicaid and CHIP agencies have identified disparities in access to substance use disorder (SUD) treatment among postpartum beneficiaries. 


  **Purpose:**


  The goal of this competition is to identify effective programs that can address equity of postpartum care for Black or African American and AI/AN beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP. 


  Phase 1 of the competition aims to identify effective programs that range in their design and range geographically. The goal of Phase 1 will be the identification of effective programs that can successfully increase access to, attendance at, and quality of care for postpartum visits for Black or African American and AI/AN beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP.


  Phase 2 builds upon the work of Phase 1. Part of the scoring criteria for Phase 2 evaluates whether the program was successfully replicated and/or expanded. Participants are expected to successfully replicate and/or expand the program: (1) in another geographic area or a wider geographic area; (2) in another clinical setting; and/or (3) by increasing the size and/or reach of the program.


  **Key Dates**


  **Phase 1:** Identification of successful programs


  **Submission period begins:** September 30, 2021, 8:00 a.m. EST.


  **Submission deadline:** Phase 1 submissions are due by December 17, 2021, 5:00 p.m. EST.


  **Phase 2:** Awarding programs that have successfully replicated and/or expanded.


  **Submission period begins:** September 16, 2022.


  **Submission deadline:** December 16, 2022, 5:00 p.m. EST.
