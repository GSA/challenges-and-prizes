  solutions that achieve significant advances over currently available retina
  organoids. Solutions must show publication-quality data demonstrating:</p>
  <ul> <li>A 3-D human retina organoid system that mimics the physiological and
  morphological features of the in vivo biology, consists of the major retina
  cell types (rod and cone photoreceptors, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, and
  ganglion cells and Muller glia) with appropriate lamination and synaptic
  organization, and represents their biological functions and interplay.
  Components (neurons, retinal pigment epithelium \[RPE], glia) may be produced
  separately or dissociated and recombined (1) if protocol is driven by a
  valuable biological question and (2) if in the process of re-assembly,
  specific functions/roles of cell types are delineated. Three-dimensional
  assembly may be achieved using various approaches, for example through
  self-organization that recapitulates natural development (&ldquo;true
  organoid&rdquo;) or through bioengineering with scaffolds, bioprinting, and/or
  microfluidic apparatuses.</li> <li>Retina organoids that are generated
  entirely from human cells (e.g. derived from iPSCs, hESCs, multipotent cells,
  or adult cells subjected to a combination of
  transdifferentiation/reprogramming methods).</li> <li>Modeling and treating
  retinal disease, or testing and developing drug (i.e., high content screening)

  retina model system that resembles the morphology of a healthy-native retina
  and is viable through formation of photoreceptor outer segments and/or

  processes. Reviewers will be asked to address:&nbsp;Cell Types:&nbsp;How many
  neuronal (or neuronal derived) cell types are stably co-cultured (rod and cone
  photoreceptors, bipolar cells, ganglion cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine
  cells, Muller glia)? Are long-term viable and functional RPE, choroid or
  non-neuronal cell types (e.g., pericytes, microglia, astrocytes) incorporated?
  To what extent does the evidence presented show presence of cell types and
  3-dimensional structure. If a cell type is lacking, is there justification for
  why it is not present and not needed for proof of principle (i.e. the disease
  being modelled lacks the specific cell type)?  Structure:&nbsp;Are organoid
  prototypes 3-dimensional and properly oriented? To what extent do the synaptic
  layers recapitulate those of a laminated retina with multiple neuron classes
  present in numbers and proportions that represent an in vivo setting (as
  indicated by biomarkers of lineage and differentiation)? How many other retina
  and retina-relevant tissues, cells, or structures are included?  Functional
  characterization of cell types:&nbsp;Are all cell types in the organoid (or
  added to the organoid) functional through the latest viable timepoint as shown

  Are the methods (part of the Appendix) sufficiently detailed such that the

  BIOLOGY/DISEASE MODELING (note:&nbsp;NEI is agnostic to which disease is
  chosen, as long as technology is developed to robustly recapitulate the
  disease):&nbsp;Does the organoid prototype demonstrate improvement in faithful

  aspect of disease phenotype in one or more assays?  Viability and
  scalability:&nbsp;If grown at one organoid/well, are 90% of organoids in a

  increase the production (e.g., many dozens) of organoids and/or allow the

  organoids to be compared in the same experiment?  Is therapeutic intervention
  to treat the disease modelled with 3-D retina organoids (e.g. via gene
  editing, small molecules, cell replacement, etc.) demonstrated? HIGH CONTENT
  SCREENING:&nbsp;Are retina organoid prototypes amenable to high content
  screening, which may include high content imaging, drug validation/toxicology,
  or functional genomic screening (e.g. does not include materials known to show
  strong compound adsorption)? Does the model recapitulate known retina
  toxicities based on morphological and functional readouts? Scalability and
  portability:&nbsp;Are organoids grown at medium throughput (e.g., in a 96-well
  plate) robust? When grown at one organoid/well, are 90% of wells in a plate
  viable, as shown by random sampling in five wells across a dish? For how long

  mass-produce (e.g., 100s) organoids such that multiple plates can be compared
