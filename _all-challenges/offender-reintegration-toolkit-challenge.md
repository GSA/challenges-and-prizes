description: '<p><strong>Submit an innovative tool or app to help individuals reentering
  their community after incarceration. Win cash.</strong></p><p>Studies show that people
  leaving the criminal justice system have a higher proportion of substance use and
  mental disorders than the general population. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health
  Services Administration (SAMHSA), an operating division of the U.S. Department of
  Health and Human Services, invites developers to create an innovative software-based
  solution, with housing, employment, prevention, treatment and recovery information,
  to assist offenders and their friends, family, probation officers, jail and prison
  case workers, and others who help them reintegrate into their communities.    No
  need to create new content—this is a chance to get creative with how to present
  existing SAMHSA content and other information (see “REQUIREMENTS” below and the
  Rules tab for more information).    </p><p><strong>Think you have a $10,000 idea? </strong>See
  the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/05/08/2015-11098/announcement-of-requirements-and-registration-for-offender-reintegration-toolkit-challenge"
  target="_blank">Rules</a> for full requirements and information on how to enter
  this challenge.    </p><p><strong>ELIGIBILITY</strong>    This challenge is open to Individuals
  (legal U.S. residents and citizens at least 18 years of age at the time of entry);
  Teams of eligible individuals; and Organizations (up to 100 employees).    </p><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong>    <strong>Content:
  </strong>You must use the SAMHSA content and information specified in the asset
  file as the content for your product<em>. </em>You may not substantially alter the
  meaning, intent, or otherwise misrepresent the content from SAMHSA’s products in
  whole or in part. The intention of this clause is to ensure that the integrity of
  the content is maintained.    </p><p><strong>Audience: </strong>Your submission should
  be developed to assist offenders and their friends, family, probation officers,
  jail and prison case workers, and others who help them reintegrate into their communities.
  The use cases provide examples of the audience for whom you are developing the product.    </p><p><strong>Platforms:
  </strong>Your submission must include a software component such as:  <ul>   <li>a
  native smartphone or tablet app (iOS, Android, Blackberry, Windows Mobile)</li>   <li>a
  Web app</li>   <li>a desktop app (Windows PC, Mac Desktop)</li>  </ul>  <strong> </strong><strong>New
  and Existing Solutions: </strong>Submissions may be newly created or pre-existing
  products modified to meet the content and requirements of this Challenge.    </p><p><strong>Supplementary
  Materials: </strong>You must submit a brief demo video of no more than five (5)
  minutes that demonstrates and explains the product, uploaded to ChallengePost and
  YouTube. You must also submit at least one (1) image/screenshot of your working
  product.    If you’re among the top five finalists, you may also be asked to participate
  in a webinar session with the judging panel to explain your product further.    </p><p><strong>Testing:
  </strong>You must make your product available for no charge to judges for evaluation
  during the judging period.   </p><p><strong>Availability: </strong>A
  free version of your product must be made available free of cost to the public for
  at least one (1) calendar year.</p>'
