description: Laboratory-based infectious disease surveillance programs, such as PulseNet,
  the National Tuberculosis Surveillance System, and the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance
  program, rely on primary culture and microbiologic testing in community hospital
  and clinical laboratories. A new generation of non-culture-based diagnostic tests
  are now beginning to enter the marketplace offering physicians faster results and,
  in some cases, more types of information than were previously available. Unfortunately,
  these new tests do not typically result in isolates being available for public health
  purposes, and, as their use continues to grow, it will likely become increasingly
  difficult or impossible to detect and investigate outbreaks or other important infectious
  disease trends.    New laboratory approaches that do not depend on isolates or culture
  for subtyping and characterization of microbes are needed to maintain and improve
  important public health activities across a range of pathogenic organisms.  CDC
  is challenging inquisitive researchers to develop a new or innovative method to
  straintype and characterize Shiga toxin-producing <em>Escherichia coli</em> (STEC)
  without using culture-based methods. The innovative straight-to-strain method will
  be able to isolate STEC from stool (a complex clinical sample) in a way that will
  make information immediately available for public health use.  <p id="p-7" data-page="51340">A
  key component of this challenge is the development of novel approaches to identifying
  and characterizing pathogens similar to normal flora in a complex matrix in a process
  that does not require any culture, including pre-enrichment. Straintyping and characterization
  of the Shiga toxin-producing STEC from clinical stool samples represents a significant
  challenge and has been selected as the target organism for this challenge. STEC
  are similar in most respects to the commensal E. coli that are carried in the intestinal
  tract of nearly everyone. Consistent identification, straintyping, and characterization
  of pathogenic STEC directly from a complex matrix, such as stool, requires the consistent
  identification of both a variable marker that can be used for subtyping and a second,
  more stable marker that can be used for definitive identification.</p>  &nbsp;
