ideaSubmitFormInstruction: 'Entries should be submitted via the Challenge’s homepage
  on challenge.gov.    You can use existing tools or platforms or create your own
  application to produce these visualizations. The geographic scale of the visualization
  can be as small as the neighborhood or community level or as large as the regional
  or national level.    Submissions should help identify potential areas or zones
  of increased exposure and/or the degree of changes in exposure or health risk resulting
  from climate change.  You may consider a short-term time scale (e.g., 0 to 20 years)
  for impacts associated with extreme events, or a longer time scale (e.g., 2050 or
  beyond) for impacts associated with sea level rise or other phenomena whose greatest
  impact will clearly be decades from now.    The challenge will award prizes for
  visualizations, tools, or applications for decision making in two categories: Category
  1 for use at the local or municipal level and Category 2 for use at a regional (multistate)
  or national level. In each category, up to three prizes and $17,500 will be awarded,
  for a total of $35,000 in prize money.    <u>A complete submission should contain
  the following items and nothing more: </u>  <ol>   <li>A brief (less than 250 words)
  description of the visualization and its potential value in improving our understanding
  of the relationship between environmental exposures and climate change.</li>   <li>A
  detailed description (limited to 1000 words, not including figures or references)
  of the visualization, tool, or application, including the technical basis for combining
  data layers and references to the scientific literature supporting the relationships
  between climate change, altered exposures, and human health outcomes, where relevant.</li>   <li>The
  visualization tool and any application or code needed to run the tool. Alternatively,
  instead of providing the tool or application itself, you may provide either a link
  to a visualization generated by the tool or application; a video demonstrating the
  tool or application; or one or more pdfs of example visualizations.</li>   <li>Instructions
  on how to install and operate any application behind a visualization tool.</li>   <li>System
  requirements required to run the application.</li>   <li>A description of, rationale
  for selecting, and complete copy of the data set. For data sets contained within
  climate.data.gov or otherwise easily obtainable from Federal sources, the URLs for
  the datasets are sufficient.</li>  </ol>  To be eligible to win this Challenge,
  submissions must also meet the following requirements:    1) Participants must provide
  continuous access to any submissions that include web postings through the Challenge
  period until January 12, 2016.    2) Submissions must be in English.    3) The data
  visualization tool or application must not use HHS or NIH logos or official seals
  in the submission, and must not claim or imply endorsement by the Federal government.    4)
  The data visualization tool or application must be designed for use with existing
  web, mobile, voice, or other platform for supporting interactions of the content
  provided with other capabilities.    5) A submission may be disqualified if the
  visualization tool or application fails to function as expressed in the description
  provided by the participant, or if the tool or application provides inaccurate or
  incomplete information.    6) Submissions must be free of malware.<br> Participant agrees
  that NIH may conduct testing on the data visualization tool or application to determine
  whether malware or other security threats may be present. NIEHS may disqualify the
  submission if, in NIEHS’ judgment, the data visualization tool or application or
  any other part of the submission may damage government or others’ equipment or operating
  environment.    In order for submissions to be evaluated, they must include clear,
  detailed processes on how they were produced, including any code if applicable.
  The processes can be submitted in a text document.    This Challenge is most interested
  in submissions that show the interaction between these three data layers:  1. locations
  and concentrations of harmful agents (i.e., exposures);  2. locations of potentially
  exposed populations; and  3. geographic and climatologic parameters conveying changing
  risks of exposure.    At a minimum, all submissions should include a data layer
  related to location of potential harmful agents and a data layer related to changes
  in levels of exposure to those potential agents cause by factors related to climate
  change.'

description: '<strong>Winners Announced!</strong>    <p>Challenge entries focused on
  creating data visualization tools and maps that connect current science on climate
  change to the exposure pathways for environmental hazards, in order to help decision
  makers and communities identify areas and people at greatest risk and help to prioritize
  protective actions. Tools created included visualizations of such climate and social
  factors as sea level rise, flooding, high heat, vulnerable communities, and hazardous
  waste sites, which were overlayed with maps of health outcomes such as mortality,
  cardiovascular disease, emergency room admissions, and asthma. Winning submissions
  will be incorporated into the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit and disseminated to
  communities and decision makers.  Additional information and interviews with winners
  can be found on: <a href="http://www.niehs.nih.gov/news/newsletter/2016/4/feature/feature%201%20-%20climate/index.htm"

  for this challenge will close at 9AM EST, Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2016.</strong>    Climate
  change is likely to alter the risks posed by environmental exposures in ways that
  are just beginning to be explored. The National Institute of Environmental Health
  Sciences invites you to help decision makers around the country understand and address
  climate change''s effects on environmental health risks by joining the Climate Change
  and Environmental Exposures Challenge (#climatechallengeNIEHS).  By creating data
  visualization tools and maps that connect current science on climate change to the
  exposure pathways for environmental hazards, innovators can help identify areas
  and people at greatest risk and help to prioritize protective actions.    You can
  visit the <a href="http://www.niehs.nih.gov/funding/challenges/climate_change/index.cfm"
  target="_blank">NIEHS webpage</a> for this challenge for additional information
  about the challenge and examples of data sets.</p>     <strong>Background</strong><br>    <p>Communities
  can face health risks from a variety of environmental exposures, including hazardous
  wastes and deposits of industrial chemicals, air pollution, harmful algal blooms,
  toxic contaminants in food, and exposures to pesticides. The effects of climate
  change may exacerbate these health risks. Fortunately, newly released data and tools,
  in combination with other publicly available datasets, allow for innovative approaches
  to demonstrating and assessing such risks.</p>    <p>Better information about climate change’s
  potential impacts on environmental exposures would improve a wide range of important
  protective decisions. At the local level, such decisions might include where to
  build day care centers or new housing. This information could also assist local
  decision makers on critical infrastructure questions, such as where to place new
  water intakes for drinking water systems, design or siting of urban waste water
  drainage or green infrastructure, or placement of monitoring equipment or other
  sensors.</p>    <p>At the national level, greater understanding of climate change’s influence
  on the magnitude and spatial distribution of environmental exposures would inform
  decisions about prioritizing efforts to remove pollution and contaminants. This
  information would also be useful in setting national standards or policies.    <u>Examples</u><u>
  of environmental exposures</u>:    1) <em>Toxic chemicals released from hazardous
  waste, mining or other industrial sites. </em>Several of the effects of climate
  change may exacerbate these exposures (for example, rising sea level, increased
  temperatures and permafrost melting, changes in wind patterns, or other climate-related
  ecological processes).    2) <em>Air pollutants</em>. These can include ozone and
  particulate matter—as climate change causes temperatures to increase or weather
  patterns to change, certain regions may see an increase or decrease in these pollutants.    &nbsp;    3)
  <em>Toxins created by molds or waterborne bacteria or algae.</em> Climate change
  will increase the frequency of extreme rainfall in certain areas, which, in combination
  with rising temperatures, can foster the growth of indoor fungi and molds. Similarly,
  elevated waterborne disease outbreaks have been reported in weeks following heavy
  rainfall.    &nbsp;    4) <em>Pesticides. </em>As the climate changes, farmers are
  expected to need to use more herbicides and pesticides because of increased growth
  of pests and weeds.    &nbsp;    5) <em>Other exposures</em>. You may want to propose
  environmental exposures other than the ones listed above.  If you do want to explore
  a different environmental exposure, your submission should include a statement explaining
  the importance of the exposure to human health and the relationship between climate
  change and changes in that exposure in the future.    &nbsp;'
