  PROBLEM</strong>    <strong>Register for the GLOS Data Challenge at http://www.glos.us/challenge/ by
  July 29, 2016, and receive some GLOS swag. </strong>    The Great Lakes contains
  18 percent of the world’s supply of fresh surface water and 84 percent of the fresh
  surface water in North America; more than 40 million people rely on the Great Lakes
  for drinking water. The Great Lakes are a valuable asset, attracting people and
  businesses. They directly support 1.5 million U.S. jobs and $62 billion in U.S.
  wages.    While progress is being made in restoring the Great Lakes, climate change,
  water quality concerns and invasive species still threaten the Great Lakes ecosystem.  <ul>    <li><strong>Climate
  change </strong>is expected to raise the Great Lakes water temperature, lower lake
  levels, drive more frequent, large storm events and reduce winter ice cover. These
  impacts will change the way people and wildlife inhabit and use the natural resources
  of the Great Lakes Basin.</li>    <li><strong>Great Lakes water quality </strong>is
  compromised by aqricultural and urban runoff, harmful algal blooms, aging water
  infrastructure, and oil and hazardous material spills. Water quality impairments
  close beaches, degrade habitats, threaten public drinking water supplies and restrict
  recreational opportunities.</li>    <li><strong>Invasive species </strong>compromise
  the integrity of the Great Lakes ecosystem. They disrupt the food web, leading to
  declines in the commercial and sport fishery. They impact municipal, recreational
  and industrial water users by clogging intake pipes and reducing recreational opportunities.</li>    <li><strong>Data
  Quality Evaluation.</strong> With advancements in technology innovation, observing
  systems are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and monitoring and observing data are
  now commonly available to stakeholders through websites and data portals.  However,
  one of the big challenges with such wide access to data today is that the quality
  of the data provided to data consumers is often unknown.  Even in situations where
  quality information is provided by the data collector, it is frequently overlooked
  by the data consumer because it is often difficult to access and interpret.  In
  turn, data consumers are consuming data of an unknown quality which can have large
  impacts on their data analysis and derived data products, which can have further
  impacts on subsequent resource management decisions.  <ul>    <li><em>(For this
  challenge, participants should use open data from the GLOS data portal (<a href="http://portal.glos.us/">http://portal.glos.us/</a>)
  to develop new tools to quantify and/or illustrate, on-the-fly, the quality of the
  data available. Ideally this solution would look at large volumes of data and automatically
  determine the quality of the data when it is selected/requested by a data consumer.
  A solution that provided some quantitative measurement of data uncertainty would
  certainly receive top honors.</em><em> </em></li>    <li><em>Winning solutions will
  enable data consumers in the Great Lakes region to assess the quality and uncertainty
  of the data they are utilizing in their data analysis and subsequent resource management
  decisions.)</em></li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  We look to harness the power of information
  technology to provide solutions to these problems and take advantage of the economic
  opportunities inherent in our shared abundant water resource.    <strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong>    Challenge
  participants should use open data to develop new data tools that give communities,
  recreational users and natural resource managers new means to improve the health
  of the Great Lakes ecosystem or to provide better access to ecosystem services within
  the Basin. Create an app, mash-up or visualization that uncovers trends, reveals
  patterns, or shows how ecosystem services could be more efficiently utilized and
  can persuade people to take action.    Enter the GLOS Data Challenge to make a difference
  in the world – and to earn cash prizes.    Winning solutions will enable government,
  industry, business, non-profit and recreational sectors in the Great Lakes region
  to address problems or build on opportunities at a personal, community or Great
  Lakes region level. Be creative with this, the sky’s the limit for your solution.    Winners
  will have their app/visualization featured on http://www.glos.us/ and will receive
  a cash prize.    More details are available at http://www.glos.us/challenge/'
