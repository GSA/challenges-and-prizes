description: <p><strong>***Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017/01/12/onc-announces-winners-consumer-and-provider-app-challenges-improve-health-information-access-and-use">press release</a>&nbsp;announcing the final, Phase&nbsp;2 winners! Congratulations to them all!***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>The Consumer Health Data Aggregator Challenge is intended to spur the development of third-party, consumer-facing applications that use open, standardized APIs to help consumers aggregate their data in one place and under their control. This challenge will focus on solving the problem that many consumers have today &ndash; the ability to easily and electronically access their health data from different health care providers using a variety of different health IT systems.</p>
    <p>The lack of interoperability between electronic health record (EHR) systems remains a significant barrier to the modernization of health IT.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources</a>&nbsp;(FHIR), developed by HL7, is a standard designed to increase the liquidity of granular patient data. The FHIR API allows data to move between vendor systems at different providers and to third-party applications for direct use by consumers. The latter use case is key to enabling patients to play a more active role in managing their health. Patients&rsquo; ability to seamlessly take their data with them as they move from provider to provider is one of the main goals of moving from a paper-based to an electronic health record system.</p>
    <p>Of course, health and wellness information is not contained solely in provider systems - between wearables, sensors, smartphones, and more, a great deal of patient data is being collected by personal and at-home devices outside of clinical settings. An app that&nbsp;truly captures all of a consumer's health data must be able to absorb and consolidate all of this data being continuously collected, much of which is available through APIs.</p>
    <p><strong>***Watch the recording of the March 31&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/1SLG1gB">Informational Webinar</a>***&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>The challenge has two phases. Phase 1 requires the submission of technical and business plans for the application (app) while Phase 2 requires that a working app be available for consumers. Phase 2 of the competition will not be limited to only those who won Phase 1 &ndash; all Phase 1 competitors, and those who did not participate in Phase 1, can submit a final app at the end of Phase 2.&nbsp;The final application must meet the following requirements:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Uses FHIR Draft Standard for Technical Use 2 (DSTU2)</li>
    <li>Aggregates all data as specified in the 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/commonclinicaldataset_ml_11-4-15.pdf">Data column</a>)</li>
    <li>Verified compatibility with different health IT developer systems implemented in production settings, 1 of which must be from the top 10 systems measured by Meaningful Use attestation per HealthIT.gov. Apps must be integrated with a minimum of 3 unique health IT developer systems in 2 unique provider settings.
    <ul>
    <li>There are two options to assess MU attestation here, by&nbsp;<a href="http://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Vendors-of-EHRs-to-Participating-Professionals.php">Healthcare Professionals</a>&nbsp;or by&nbsp;<a href="http://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Vendors-of-EHRs-to-Participating-Hospitals.php">Hospitals</a>. The top 10 system can be selected from Primary EHR Vendor &ndash; not Secondary EHR Vendor &ndash; in either of these reports.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Has been tested with patients and used in production settings</li>
    <li>Available to consumers through at least one of the following modes:&nbsp; mobile web, iOS Store, or Android Stores</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Phase 2 Participation Requirements&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>The second phase, to run from&nbsp;June 2 to November 7, will entail the actual development of the apps, verification of technical capabilities, user testing/piloting, and public release of the apps. This will include remote testing with providers and health IT developers to test the technical abilities of the apps to connect to in-production systems. Participants will submit:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Working app
    <ul>
    <li>Provide the url to download/access the app.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Video demonstrating the app (maximum of 5 minutes)
    <ul>
    <li>Provide the url of the video on YouTube or Vimeo.</li>
    <li>The video must highlight the use of FHIR to integrate with EHR vendor systems, including demonstration of data exchange with each system. The rest of the video should address the remaining evaluation criteria:&nbsp; functionality and quality of data aggregation, privacy and security of patient data, and user experience and visual appeal.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Slide deck describing app (maximum of 15 slides)
    <ul>
    <li>Overall, the slide deck should complement the video demonstration. It should include a list of the active FHIR integrations with EHRs at provider settings, as demonstrated in the video. It should describe other functionality pertaining to the review criteria, particularly anything that was not covered in the video.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The grand prize winner will receive $50,000 and a second place winner will receive $25,000. There will be an additional $25,000 prize for the app that connects to the greatest number of unique health IT developer systems implemented in production settings (the "Ultimate Connector"), which can be won by any entry, including the grand prize or 2nd place winner. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
