ideaSubmitFormInstruction: 'A complete entry consists of two components, a written
  entry and a comic strip or video entry, described below. Entrants should review
  the entry form on the online platform for more details about the submission requirements
  and process. Entrants must register through the online platform.    A successful
  entry will be original, creative and visually appealing. No gratuitous violence
  or other inappropriate content will be permitted.    <u>Written Entry </u>    The
  written entry will be submitted on the challenge platform in the four sections detailed
  below. Each section has a 1,600-character limit including spaces (about 250 words).    &nbsp;  <ul>   <li><strong>The
  Superhero: </strong>Name your superhero. Who are they and what is their story? Clearly
  and succinctly describe the main attributes of your hero and provide any necessary
  background information about them, including abilities, accessories and strengths
  and weaknesses.</li>   <li><strong>The Accessory/Gear: </strong>Describe your superhero’s
  nanotechnology-enabled accessory or gear. Is it a vehicle, costume, weapon, or something
  else? Make sure the description focuses on the attributes of the gear: What can
  it do and why? How does it help the superhero?</li>   <li><strong>The Technology:</strong>
  Describe how your gear incorporates nanotechnology. Give a background of the research
  behind your chosen technology. How does current research make your gear possible?
  What further advances are needed to make the gear a reality? This section does not
  need to be overly technical, but you should include at least two references to current
  nanotechnology research either in the form of news articles or scholarly journal
  articles (not Wikipedia), to support your explanation of the technology. The technology
  doesn’t have to be currently possible, but there must be research to support that
  it may be in the future. Extra space will be given for references.</li>   <li><strong>The
  Unexpected:</strong> There are often unexpected consequences as new technologies
  enter into society. Describe one possible result if your nanotechnology-enabled
  gear was used irresponsibly (for example, like the consequences of invisibility
  cloaks explored in this <a href="http://www.nisenet.org/catalog/media/invisibility_cloak">video</a>).
  How could society help reduce the risks of this unplanned consequence?</li>  </ul>  &nbsp;    <u>Comic
  Strip Entry</u>    The comic strip entry will be submitted on the online competition
  platform and should be no longer than one page. The comic strip should:  <ul>   <li>Clearly
  introduce the superhero and gear and tell a story. The comic strip should have a
  unified voice, vitality and energy, and should emphasize how the accessory is useful
  in overcoming the story’s conflict. It should also give insights not provided in
  the written entry to create a novel presentation. A successful entry will be visually
  striking and edited to a high standard. The comic strip should also deliver clear
  and understandable messages using non-technical language.</li>   <li>Be composed
  either by hand or using a digital comic strip generator or drawing program.</li>   <li>Not
  include any copyrighted imagery or items (resources for non-copyrighted images below).</li>   <li>Be
  a JPEG file type.</li>   <li>Provide a short caption to be displayed with the comic
  strip if chosen for presentation.</li>  </ul>  <u>Video Entry</u>    The video entry
  will be submitted on the online competition platform and should consist of a single
  video, no longer than 90-seconds.  <ul>   <li>The video should clearly introduce
  the superhero and gear and articulate a story. The video should have a unified voice,
  vitality and energy, and should emphasize how the gear is useful in overcoming the
  story’s conflict. It should also give insights not provided in the written entry
  to create a novel presentation. A successful entry will be visually striking and
  edited to a high standard. The video should also deliver clear and understandable
  messages using non-technical language.</li>   <li>Videos do not have to include
  credits, but if they do, these will be included in the 90-second time limit.</li>   <li>Entrants
  must upload video submissions to YouTube and provide a link to the video on the
  entry form.</li>   <li>Provide a short caption to be displayed with the video if
  chosen for presentation.</li>  </ul>'

description: '<p><b><em>You are invited to compete in "Generation Nano: Small Science,
  Superheroes," a competition that asks individual high school students to submit
  an original idea for a superhero, using modern nanotechnology research to inspire
  unique "gear" for their hero. Students will submit a short written entry, as well
  as a short video or comic, that illustrates their superhero''s nanotechnology-enabled
  gear. Winners will receive cash prizes and the opportunity to showcase their creation
  at the 2016 USA Science &amp; Engineering Festival in Washington, D.C.</em></b></p>    <p>The idea of the superhero armed with their fantastical powers has served to mesmerize
  the world for nearly a century. The ability to fly, cling to walls with bare hands,
  and see with X-ray vision is popularly interpreted as a supposition based on no
  solid foundation. Often, superhero abilities appear magical rather than being grounded
  in science and technology. As we make advances in nanotechnology and materials research, we''re discovering that superhero powers may not be that farfetched.</p> <p>Through nanotechnology applications like targeted drugs, self-assembled nanodevices, molecular motors, graphene in electrical supercapacitors, and artificial red blood cells, we may not have to wait until that fateful day we''re bitten by a radioactive spider in order
  to become superhuman!</p>    <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National
  Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) are excited to introduce "Generation Nano: Small
  Science, Superheroes!" This competition asks high school students to design a costume,
  gadget, vehicle or other gear for an original superhero that uses technology extrapolated
  from current nanotechnology research. This competition will help students learn
  about the potential and limitations of real world nanotechnology. Students will
  submit a written entry explaining their superhero and how they have incorporated
  nanotechnology research into their hero''s gear, as well as either a short comic
  strip or video introducing the superhero.</p>'
