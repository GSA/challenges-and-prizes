description: '<p>Mental health is as important as physical health. However, many people
  with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or traumatic brain injury (TBI) donâ€™t
  get the care they need â€“ including our nationâ€™s Service members.    Defense Centers
  of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury (DCoE) exists
  to improve the lives of our nation''s Service members, veterans, and their families
  by advancing excellence in psychological health and traumatic brain injury prevention
  and care â€“ and we want to hear from you.  <p></p>We challenge
  you to share your thoughts on improving mental health care.    If
  you could pitch an idea to fill gaps in care and improve the well-being of people
  with PTSD or traumatic brain injury, what would it be?   <p></p>  Gaps in care
  may exist in areas such as prevention, diagnosis and identification, treatment,
  or research. Solutions can include ideas for new services, technologies, products,
  or specific research related to PTSD and TBI.  <p></p>  You Can Make a Difference    Your
  input is valuable and we want to hear from everyone â€” whether you are a caregiver,
  a clinician, someone living with PTSD or TBI, or someone with a good idea to share.
  You donâ€™t have to be an expert to participate. <p></p>  Background  <br>  What''s
  DCoE?    <a href="http://dcoe.mil/">DCoEÂ </a>is
  a Defense Department organization that works to improve the lives of service members,
  veterans, and their families, by advancing excellence in psychological health and
  traumatic brain injury prevention and care.    DCoE includes three centers:Â <a href="http://dvbic.dcoe.mil/">Defense
  and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC)</a>,Â <a href="http://www.pdhealth.mil/about_dhcc.asp">Deployment
  Health Clinical Center (DHCC)</a>, andÂ <a href="http://t2health.dcoe.mil/">National
  Center for Telehealth and Technology (T2)</a>. <p></p>   Psychological
  Health<br>    Psychological health encompasses many aspects of a person''s
  mental well-being. Common psychological health concerns among service members include
  posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and substance use disorder.
  In addition to advancing the treatment for these concerns, DCoE helps connect people
  with available relevant resources, develops products and works to clarify misconceptions. <p></p>   Traumatic
  Brain Injury <br>   Traumatic brain injury can be the result of a blow or jolt
  to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the function of the brain.
  In the general population 1.7 million people sustain a TBI each year, resulting
  in 52,000 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<sup>1</sup>Â and
  Rand Corp<sup>2</sup>. The most common TBIs are mild, also known as concussions.    <sup>1</sup>Langlois,
