description: <p>The National Eye Institute (NEI), part of the National Institutes of Health, is seeking ideas for how to develop advances in vitro 3-D human retina organoid models. The goal of the challenge is to turn innovative ideas into concrete concepts for the development of a 3-D system that models the cellular organization and function of the human retina. Full description and details of this prize competition are defined on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/about/goals-and-accomplishments/nei-research-initiatives/3-d-retina-organoid-challenge-3-d-roc/2017-ideation-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEI&rsquo;s challenge details</a>&nbsp;page. NEI is seeking innovative solutions to achieve significant advances over currently available protocols to grow retina organoids. As solvers address the evaluation criteria outlined below, they should state how and why they expect their proposed new methods or changes/additions to existing methods will improve aspects of retina organoids. Solutions must outline ideas to produce 3-D retina organoids that:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Are generated from human cells (derived from iPSC, federally approved ESC, multipotent cells, or adult cells subjected to a combination of transdifferentiation/reprogramming methods);</li>
    <li>Are physiologically and morphologically relevant to normal or disease state; and</li>
    <li>Consist of the major retina cell types and represent their biological functions and interplay.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Solutions that propose to grow cells in 2-D culture using a tissue-on-a-chip system are not of interest for this Challenge. However, creative approaches that incorporate use of microfluidics or perfusion to enhance culture of 3-D organoids are encouraged.</p>
prizes: <h2>Ideation winner and honorable mention</h2>
    <p>The National Eye Institute awarded $90,000 in prize money to a team led by Erin Lavik, Sc.D., at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, for its concept to create a living model of the human retina. Lavik&rsquo;s team participated in the&nbsp;3-D Retina Organoid Challenge (3-D ROC) &ldquo;ideation&rdquo; phase, which asked participants for&nbsp;ideas&nbsp;to generate human retinas from stem cells.&nbsp;Concepts were evaluated based on their innovativeness and feasibility.&nbsp;A review panel assessed how each proposal addressed scientific challenges such as how to assemble distinct and anatomically correct layers of retinal tissue, assess retinal cell function, and use the prototypes to understand diseases or test therapies.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A follow-on &ldquo;reduction to practice,&rdquo; or implementation, challenge will ask participants to submit publication-quality data showing they can build functional human retina&nbsp;tissue.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Winning team</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Erin Lavik</strong>, ScD, University of Maryland, Baltimore&nbsp;County</li>
    <li><strong>Steven Bernstein</strong>, MD, PhD, University of Maryland Medical&nbsp;School</li>
    <li><strong>Adam Day</strong>, University of Maryland, Baltimore&nbsp;County</li>
    <li><strong>Bryan Ibarra</strong>, University of&nbsp;Miami</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The team&rsquo;s idea is to build a retina by screen printing adult neural progenitor-derived retinal neurons in layers that mimic the structure of the human retina.&nbsp;The system is scalable and efficient which should enable the high reproducibility and increased throughput necessary for drug&nbsp;testing.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Honorable mention teams</h2>
    <p>Five teams were also recognized with&nbsp;honorable mention.</p>
    <h3>Carrier team</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Rebecca Carrier, PhD, Northeastern&nbsp;University</li>
    <li>Michael Young, PhD, Schepens Eye Research&nbsp;Institute</li>
    <li>Joyce Y Wong, PhD, Boston&nbsp;University</li>
    <li>Joydip Kundu, PhD, Northeastern&nbsp;University</li>
    <li>Petr Baranov, MD, PhD,&nbsp;Schepens Eye Research&nbsp;Institute</li>
    <li>Mike Ferguson, Boston&nbsp;University</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Their organoid-microvessel co-culture system proposes to add vasculature embedded in a biomimetic hydrogel to organoids to increase oxygen and nutrient flow and mimic chemical and physical cues present in developing eye tissue. The system also includes retinal pigmented epithelium and can be used to model and study age-related macular degeneration&nbsp;(AMD).&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Gamm team</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>David Gamm, MD, PhD, University of&nbsp;Wisconsin</li>
    <li>William Murphy, PhD, University of&nbsp;Wisconsin</li>
    <li>Nader Sheibani, PhD, University of&nbsp;Wisconsin</li>
    <li>Chris Sorenson, PhD University of&nbsp;Wisconsin</li>
    <li>Bikash Pattnaik, PhD, University of&nbsp;Wisconsin&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Melissa Skala, PhD University of&nbsp;Wisconsin</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the eye, the outer neural retina is fed via diffusion while the inner neural retina requires a separate microvasculature that is absent in organoids. This results in disparity in outer vs. inner neural retina survival and function in vitro. The team proposes to incorporate a perfusable inner retinal microvasculature using microfluidic technology and to model retinal microvascular diseases such as diabetic&nbsp;retinopathy.</p>
    <h3>Liu team</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Wei Liu, PhD, Albert Einstein College of&nbsp;Medicine</li>
    <li>Rui Chen, PhD, Baylor College of&nbsp;Medicine</li>
    <li>Z. Jimmy Zhou, PhD, Yale School of&nbsp;Medicine</li>
    <li>Albert Lowe, Albert Einstein College of&nbsp;Medicine</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The protocol efficiently generates retina organoids by altering key time-consuming variable steps. They propose to engineer additional retinal tissues on scaffolds and use the system to study Leber Congenital Amaurosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Pelaez team</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Daniel Pelaez, PhD, University of&nbsp;Miami</li>
    <li>J. William Harbour, MD, University of&nbsp;Miami</li>
    <li>Zenith Acosta, University of&nbsp;Miami</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The team&rsquo;s novel tissue bioreactor system compartmentalizes and creates gradients of stimuli such that the maturation of inner and outer retinal cells are induced separately. The system recapitulates the normal physiology in which the retina is exposed to a steep gradient of oxygen tensions across the highly oxygenated outer retina, and the hypoxic inner retina and can be used to model&nbsp;Retinoblastoma.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Schenke-Layland team</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Katja Schenke-Layland, PhD, Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and&nbsp;Biotechnology</li>
    <li>Stefan Liebau, PhD,&nbsp;Eberhard Karls University&nbsp;T&uuml;bingen</li>
    <li>Peter Loskill, PhD,&nbsp;Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and&nbsp;Biotechnology</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The culture system proposed allows for 3-D co-culture of retinal organoids, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and further cell types in a defined and reproducible microenvironment, featuring a physiological vasculature-like perfusion for multiple weeks. Their 3-D Retina-on-a-chip system features 48 individual units in an integrated chip with standard well plate-dimensions that will be amenable for high content drug&nbsp;screening.</p>
