description: <p>The U.S. Department of Education has launched the EdSim Challenge with
  a cash prize pool of $680,000 and additional sponsor prizes from IBM, Microsoft,
  Oculus, and Samsung. The Challenge calls upon the virtual reality, video game developer,

  that will prepare students for the globally competitive workforce of the 21st century.    Successful
  simulations will pair the engagement of commercial games with rigorous educational
  content that strengthens academic, technical, and employability skills.    Those
  interested in entering the Challenge should submit their simulation concepts by

  mentorship as they refine their concept and build a simulation prototype. The Challenge
