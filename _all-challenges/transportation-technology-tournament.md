description: The National Operations Center of Excellence (NOCoE) and the U.S. DOT
  ITS JPO PCB program announce a competition for students to work directly with state
  and local DOTs to solve real-world transportation problems utilizing ITS and TSMO
  solutions.    Student teams will assemble and work with a local or state agency
  to define a problem or challenge in their region, or choose to address one of the
  sample problems outlined below. After submitting an initial contest application
  identify the team and the problem or challenge, students will work with academic
  advisors to learn about potential ITS and TSMO solutions via online training programs
  outlined below. Teams will then utilize their experience, education, and new coursework
  to develop a solution or suite of solutions to directly address the originally defined
  problem. Students will submit their solutions via a proposal. Finalist teams will
  develop a presentation and then will be flown to the Institute of Transportation
  Engineers (ITE) 2018 Annual Meeting in Minneapolis to give a live presentation in
  front of a panel of judges made up of leaders in the ITS and TSMO community.
