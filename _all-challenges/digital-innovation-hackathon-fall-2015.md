   However, an individual or entity shall not be deemed ineligible to win prize
  money because the individual or entity used Federal facilities or consulted
  with Federal employees during a competition if the facilities and employees
  are made available to all individuals and entities participating in the competition
  on an equitable basis.    </p><p>Predetermined teams of up to 5 members are welcome
  to include a stand-alone or mix of private industry, non-profit, and academia.
   Modification to team make-up may occur based on team skill make-up at the direction
  of the competition host.    Participants agree to assume any and all risks and
  waive claims against the federal government and its related entities, except
  in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of
  property, revenue, or profits, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising

  insurance policy and registered participants agreeing to indemnify the Federal
  Government against third party claims for damages arising from or related to
  the competition activities, and the Federal Government for damage or loss to
  Government property resulting from such an activity.</p><p>As GSA is under a strict
  duty not to give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual,
  participants must agree to take diligent care to avoid the appearance of Government
  endorsement of competition participation and submission.  Participants must
  agree not to refer to GSA’s use of your submission (be it product or service)
  in any commercial advertising or similar promotions in a manner that could reasonably
  imply (in the judgment of a reasonable person) that the GSA or the federal government
  endorses, prefers, sponsors, or has an affiliation with participants’ products
  or services.</p><p>Participants agree that GSA’s trademarks, logos, service marks,
  trade names, or the fact that GSA awarded a prize to a participant, shall not
  be used by the participant to imply direct GSA endorsement of participant or
  participant’s submission.  Both participants and GSA may list the other party’s
  name in a publicly available customer or other list so long as the name is not
  displayed in a more prominent fashion than any other third-party name.    <strong>Requirements</strong>    The
  final solution should be open source code and placed on a GSA site to be specified
  to participants the day of the event. “Open source” refers to a program in which
  the source code is available to the general public for use and/or modification
  from its original design free of charge.</p><p>In order to be Open Source Initiative
  Certified, the solution must meet the following ten criteria:  <ol>    <li>The
  author or holder of the license of the source code cannot collect royalties
  on the distribution of the program;</li>    <li>The distributed program must
  make the source code accessible to the user;</li>    <li>The author must allow
  modifications and derivations of the work under the program’s original name;</li>    <li>No
  person, group, or field of endeavor can be denied access to the program;</li>    <li>The
  rights attached to the program must not depend on the program being part of
  a particular software distribution; and</li>    <li>The licensed software cannot
  place restrictions on other software that is distributed   with it;</li>    <li>The
  solution must be an online, interactive solution that meets the goals and objectives
  provided in this document;</li>    <li> The solution must include documentation
  of all data sources used;</li>    <li> The solution must include a description
  of how the solution can be updated with additional data from other agencies;</li>    <li> The
  solver must provide recommendations to enhance Government insights through improvement
  in data collection.</li>  </ol></p><p>The winner(s) of the competition will, in consideration
  of the prize(s) to be awarded, grant to GSA a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free
  license to use any and all intellectual property to the winning entry for any
  governmental purpose, including the right to permit such use by any other agency
  or agencies of the Federal Government.  All other rights of the winning entrant
  will be retained by the winner of the competition.</p><p><strong><u>SCOPE</u></strong>    Any

description: 'Hackathon projects may include the following:  <ul>    <li><strong>Green
  House Gas (GHG) Reduction Visualization</strong> – The Office of Governmentwide
  Policy (OGP) has been working to create an analytical framework and tool to support
  agencies in meeting the goals outlined in a recent Executive Order 13693 ‘Planning
  for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade’, regarding greenhouse gas emission
  reductions.  The model currently uses several variables to help agencies examine
  how increasing their use of E-85 capable vehicles and replacing gas-powered vehicles
  with E-85 capable vehicles would affect their total greenhouse gas emissions.  Skills
  desired include database coding ability (<u>g.</u>, SQL language), analytical research,
  and experience using data visualization software.</li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li><strong>Data
  Center Consolidation Mashup and Tool</strong> – Multiple stakeholders including
  the White House, Congress, and government agencies share a common interest in better
  utilizing government data centers.  This has led to multiple report generation from
  multiple sources to better understand power consumption and data center utilization
  and efficiency.  The purpose of this challenge is to mashup different datasets into
  visualization and application for all stakeholders to utilize.  Skills desired include
  web and application developers, user experience (UX) designers, data scientists,
  and data center SMEs.</li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li><strong>Travel Challenge 2.0 App
  Development</strong> – As a continuation of a Travel Challenge held in 2014, GSA
  is looking for developers to take the Travel Application to the next level.  Developed
  in Python code, this tool is close to production quality and needs some finishing
  code and design ideas.  Skills desired include Python developers and UX designers.</li>  </ul>  Participants
  will be provided all final project ideas, existing code, and publicly available
  datasets in advance of the event.  Event information will be posted on the following
  page, <u>http://open.gsa.gov/Digital-Innovation-Hackathon-Fall2015</u>, and will
  be updated as necessary.'
