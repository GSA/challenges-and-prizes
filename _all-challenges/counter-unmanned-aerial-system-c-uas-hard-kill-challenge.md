rules: '<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Hard Kill Challenge Overview</span></h3>  The
  Hard Kill Challenge will provide JIDO and other DoD agencies an opportunity
  to evaluate where current technology is concerning hard killing rotor and fixed
  wing UASs. This Challenge will consist of three scored phases. The first phase
  is primarily set-up to verify the ability of each vendor’s C-UAS system to hard
  kill a UAS. To advance to each subsequent phase, a vendor must hard kill a minimum
  of one UAS in each phase. This Challenge will only use Group I rotor and fixed
  wing UASs.  <h3><span style="color: #993300;">Phase I - Initial Assessment</span></h3>  Phase
  I is the initial C-UAS system assessment phase. During this phase there will
  be 12 scored test events and four unscored test events.    Six test events will
  consist of one rotors UAS hovering 50-100m Above Ground Level (AGL) at 250m,
  500m and/or 1000m. Each test event will be no longer than 15 minutes. The test
  events will start at a distance of 250m. Teams must defeat two rotor UASs at
  each distance to move to the next further distance. It is possible that all
  six test events will take place at 250m if the team fails to defeat two rotor
  UASs.    Six test events will consist of one fixed winged UAS flying in an oval
  pattern 50-100m AGL at 250m. 500m, and 1000m. Each test event will be no longer
  than 15 minutes. The test events will start at a distance of 250m. Teams must
  defeat two fixed winged UASs at each distance to move to the next further distance.
  It is possible that all six test events will take place at 250m if the team
  fails to defeat two rotor UASs.    For those teams that have defeated a minimum
  of one UAS (rotor or fixed winged), they will participate in four unscored test
  events where the Red Team will provide Counter-Counter Measures (CCMs) to the
  UASs. These test events will start at the farthest distance that the team previously
  defeat the rotor/fixed winged UAS.    <em><strong>Phase I Scoring</strong></em>. 
  Scoring for each test event is based on a combination of time it takes to defeat
  the UAS and the distance. See the attachment for more details.    <span style="color:
  #3366ff;">Teams who have defeated a minimum of one UAS (rotor or fixed winged)
  will move to Phase II</span>.  <h3><span style="color: #993300;">Phase II -
  Single UAS Missions (Rotor &amp; Fixed Wing UASs)</span></h3>  Phase II will
  consist of eight test events. Four test events will consist of a single rotor
  UAS and four test events consisting of a single fixed wing UAS conducting either
  an ISR or attack mission. Each mission will start at approximately 3000m from
  the objective based on the performance specifications of each UAS. The team''s
  objective is to defeat the UAS at the farthest possible distance.    <em><strong>Phase
  II Scoring</strong></em>.  Scoring for each test event is based on the distance
  a UAS is defeated. The farther the distance the higher the score. See the attachment
  for more details.  <h3><span style="color: #993300;">Phase III - Swarm UAS Missions
  (Rotor and Fixed Wing UASs)</span></h3>  Phase III will consist of four UAS
  swarm test events. This test event will be similar to Phase II with the exception
  being that each mission will consist of multiple UASs. The first two missions
  will consist of two UASs (one rotor and one fixed wing), the 3rd mission will
  consist of three UASs (two rotors and one fixed wing) and the 4th mission will
  consist of three UASs (one rotor and two fixed wings).    <em><strong>Phase
  III Scoring</strong></em>.  Scoring for each test event is based on the distance
  each UAS is defeated. The farther the distance the higher the score. See the
  attachment for more details.  <h3><span style="color: #993300;">Attachments</span></h3>  <a

description: 'The threat of unmanned aerial systems (UAS''s) to American interests
  within the continental United States and outside our borders is an ongoing concern.
  Continued and rapid improvements in technology not only are increasing the availability
  of these unmanned technologies, but also are:  <ul>    <li>Allowing greater UAS
  payloads (i.e., payload weight divided by vehicle weight)</li>    <li>Easing the
  ability to operate, fly, navigate and transport unmanned systems</li>    <li>Lowering
  the cost to manufacture and operate this equipment</li>  </ul>  With these technological
  advances, however, also comes an increased potential for hostile actors to deploy
  UASs in very nefarious ways.  The C-UAS Hard Kill Challenge will provide the Joint
  Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization (JIDO), United States Central Command (USCENTCOM),
  Program Directorate Counter-Rocket Artillery Mortar Missiles (PD C-RAM), DoD agencies,
  and U.S. Government agencies and coalition partners an opportunity to review the
  current state of technology to defeat rotary and fixed wing UASs.    To assess current
  technology, the Joint Improvised Threat-Defeat Organization (JIDO), Defense Threat
  Reduction Agency (DTRA) is sponsoring a C-UAS Hard Kill Challenge at White Sands
  Missile Range, NM starting late February. Teams only need to be at the site for
  their portion. It is anticipated that teams will only have to be onsite for approximately
  5 days. The C-UAS Hard Kill Challenge is focused on evaluating "Hard Kill" technologies
  that can defeat UASs with a flyswatter approach. For the purpose of this event,
  "hard kill" shall be defined as the physical interruption of a UAS''s ability to
  maintain lift and continue its mission via the direct capture of the UAS, the physical
  destruction of the airframe and/or the permanent ability to disrupt the power to
  the airframe.    The C-UAS Hard Kill Challenge is open to teams consisting of private
  industry, government entities and government/industry challenge teams. The focus
  of this challenge is on technologies that can "hard kill" a UAS beyond 250 meters.
  Participation is at the teams'' own expense. During the challenge, teams will have
  the opportunity to "hard kill" a combined 30 rotor- and fixed-wing Group I UASs
  in scored events and four additional UASs in non-scored events.    For those teams
  that cannot afford to engage 34 UASs, JIDO will hold a demonstration phase where
  select teams can demonstrate their systems to the government stakeholders. Teams
  who only participate in the demonstration are not eligible to compete for the award.    Only
  a limited number of registrants will be selected to participate in the challenge
  and demonstration. A panel of subject matter experts, or SMEs, will review each
  team package to determine the most qualified candidates. The number of participants
  is limited due to logistical concerns at the range, cost of targets and range time.    &nbsp;    &nbsp;'
