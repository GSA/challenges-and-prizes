  Prize Purse is a total of $45,000.  The Prize Purse may increase, but will not
  decrease.  Any increases in the Prize Purse will be posted on the Event Website
  and published in the Federal Register.  The Prize Purse will be used to fund
  one or more awards.    NIST will announce via the Event Website any Entry(ies)
  as to which the Judges have made a cash award (each, an “Award”).  The anticipated
  number and amount of the Awards that will be awarded for this Competition is set
  forth in the Federal Register Notice; however, the Judges are not obligated
  to make all or any Awards, and reserve the right to award fewer than the anticipated
  number of Awards in the event an insufficient number of eligible Entries meet
  any one or more of the Judging Criteria for this Competition, based on the Judges''
  evaluation of the quality of Entries and in their sole discretion.  Awards will
  be made based on the Judges’ evaluation of an Entry’s compliance with the Judging
  Criteria for this Competition.  All potential winners will be notified by the
  e-mail address provided in the submission document and may be required to complete
  further documentation confirming their eligibility.  Return of any notification
  as “undeliverable” will result in disqualification.  After verification of eligibility,
  Awards will be distributed in the form of a check or electronic funds transfer
  addressed to the official representative specified in the winning entry.  That
  official representative will have sole responsibility for further distribution
  of any Award among Participants in a group Entry or within a company or institution
  that has submitted an Entry through that representative.  Each list of Entries
  receiving Awards for the Competition will be made public according to the timeline
  outlined on the Event Website.    All Awards are a one-time offer and there
  is no offer of licensure, royalty, or other financial compensation implied beyond
  the Awards.  Winners are responsible for all taxes and reporting related to
  any Award received as part of the Competition.    All costs incurred in the
  preparation of Competition Entries are to be borne by Participants.  <h4 id="evaluation-judging-and-selection-of-winner-s"><strong>Evaluation,

  Experts will consist of NIST employees or NIST associates and will provide initial
  assessments of App submissions using the criteria described herein to determine
  whether the submission meets the minimum criteria.  Subject Matter Experts will
  not select winners of any Awards.    A panel of highly qualified Judges appointed
  by the NIST Director will select winners of Awards to be awarded to First, Second,
  and Third Place Submissions using the Judging Criteria described herein. The
  panel of Judges has a collective expertise that creates an overall balanced
  panel with broad representation of relevant areas to the challenge such as App
  design, NIST datasets, measurement science, standards, data security, user interfaces,
  websites, and/or mobile devices. Judges include individuals from both inside
  and outside NIST who are experts in areas relevant to the challenge. The Judges
  may not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer,
  director, or agent of any entity that is a registered Participant in this Competition,
  and may not have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who
  is a registered Participant.  In the event of such a conflict, a Judge must
  recuse himself or herself.  A Participant(s) should review the list of the Judges
  available at the Event Website, and must identify, as part of their Entry submission,
  any Judge who has personal or financial interests in, or is an employee, officer,
  director, or agent of any entity that is a Participant in this Competition,
  or who has a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a
  Participant.  Thereafter, a Participant(s) must immediately inform the Competition
  Sponsor through the Event Website of a change in status resulting in a conflict
  for any Judge as described above.  Failure to do so may disqualify a Participant(s)
  from receiving an Award.  <h4 id="intellectual-property-rights"><strong>Intellectual

winner-solution-description-0: "We wanted to design an app that lets scientists,
  researchers and students access relevant NIST data on chemical species in a
  way that minimally interrupts their workflow. Our solution: allow users to link
  NFC tags with notes about a chemical species. Then, with a simple tap of an
  NFC tag, the most up-to-date information is presented quickly to the user.\r\n\r\nUse
  this feature to keep track of the history of lab samples, while providing easy
  access to NIST data about that sample's constituent materials. Or engage students
  with an interactive periodic table that never goes out-of-date.\r\n\r\nWe've
  also worked hard to present the data in a meaningful, yet practical manner.\r\n\r\n*Search
  through species using common names, formulas or CAS numbers.\r\n*View basic
  element information such as atomic weights, ionization energies and isotope
  distributions in an intuitive manner\r\n*Interact with thermochemical data through
  dynamic plots\r\n*Access the accurate numbers in table form\r\n\r\nWe're excited
  to see how Meru Lab Reference can be used to enhance the experience and productivity
  of the working scientist and student. However you use Meru Lab Reference, you
  get the information you need at the tap of a tag."

winner-solution-description-2: "We used our sense of fun and curiosity to \"grow\"
  this app, much like a chemically curious human would grow crystals in a petri-dish
  at home! What you see here is not only a functionally intuitive and useful app,
  but one that appeals to the curiosity of the human mind and keeps you coming
  back for more. The use-appeal (oh-la-la!) factor was stirred in by our UX and
  design specialists\r\n\r\nThe current version of the app utilizes 3 NIST databases
  plus elemental data from the public domain to provide a sleek interface with
  intuitive search functionality. Users can search for elements and compounds
  based on name, formula and even common names like moth balls or water. Every
  element and compound has a details page which lists various properties for it.
  Users may save their favorite elements and compound for quick reference, or
  even share the data with their colleagues or friends."

winner-solution-description-3: "Don't just look up reference data, use it! This
  app lets users find the data they're looking for, and do calculations with it,
  to boot.\r\n\r\nInspiration\r\nThinking about the challenge, I realized that
  not only do students and scientists need to access the constants in NIST's databases,
  but generally they want to do more than that. When I was in grad school, I rarely
  wanted to know Planck's constant just for the sake of knowing. It was generally
  part of a calculation. I found myself constantly bouncing back and forth between
  my calculator and my reference materials. This took time, introduced errors,
  and was unnecessary. Why not combine the two?\r\n\r\nWhat it does\r\nPicture
  a scientific calculator... that is actually scientific. In addition to the standard
  calculator buttons (multiply, divide, numbers), you've also got buttons for
  a whole bunch of the constants from NIST's datasets. So, hit the Planck's constant
  button, and suddenly you've input it into the calculator, just as easy as hitting
  '4'. The calculator deftly handles, combines, and converts units, too. Get the
  results you want, simply."

description: <p>Scientists and engineers need data—from the atomic weight of carbon and
  the structure of benzene, to the most precise value for the speed of light. High
  quality physical and chemical reference data help researchers design experiments,
  build better products, solve health and environmental problems, and even study the
  stars. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, is a non-regulatory
  agency of the United States Department of Commerce. </p><p>NIST provides some of the most
  accurate and comprehensive datasets in the world. Physicists, biochemical engineers,
  environmental researchers, and many other technically trained experts routinely
  use NIST Standard Reference Data in their workday. Students from high school through
  graduate school use the same datasets to master the ropes of scientific discovery.
  NIST needs help making sure our customers can find and better use our reference
  data, putting the information in the hands of scientists and engineers. </p><p>The eligible
  NIST datasets for this challenge include chemical and physical datasets that are
  frequently accessed, and/or data that is related and would be good for mash ups. 
  Help drive innovation and support research by developing your own mobile applications
  that use NIST Standard Reference Data!</p>
