  Reclamation, in collaboration with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE),
  is sponsoring this three-phase Guardians of the Reservoir Challenge. The goal
  of this challenge is to find and demonstrate innovative solutions that remove
  or transport the amount of sediment building up in the reservoirs, replacing
  available space for water storage, that provide critical water supplies for
  the country. The build-up of sediment leaves less room for water, and less
  water means that our reservoirs eventually may not be able to meet the demand
  of the communities we serve. Such impacts have been experienced at some
  Reclamation reservoirs and are anticipated to occur more frequently in the
  future.  Reclamation’s primary interest is in technology that will move
  sediment downstream at the average annual rate at which it would otherwise
  accumulate but approaches that can help regain lost reservoir capacity are of
  interest if they can do so in addition to meeting environmental and other
  performance criteria.

  Total Cash Prize Pool: $550,000


  **Prize Breakdown:**


  * Phase 1:  As many as 5 of the top submissions will advance to Phase 2.  Winners each receive $75,000 (total of $375,000 awarded)

  * Phase 2:  As many as 3 of the top-performing approaches will advance to Phase 3.  Winners each receive $25,000 (total of $75,000 awarded)

  * Phase 3:  The top-performing approach wins $100,000


  **Non-monetary Prizes**


  The authors of the most compelling submissions to this Guardians of the Reservoir Challenge will have the opportunity to develop and demonstrate their technologies at increasing scales for the challenge sponsors. In addition to prize money, winners may receive review comments and/or observations from their technology demonstrations and may have additional opportunities to work with Reclamation, USACE, or their partners to further develop their approaches.
