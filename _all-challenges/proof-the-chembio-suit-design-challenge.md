description: 'The current chemical biological suit’s burden, weight, and bulkiness
  restrict the warfighter’s agility, range of motion, and maneuverability necessary
  to conduct their duties. It also adds additional heat stress during physically active
  tasks. The suit materials and its various parts are disjointed and do not seamlessly
  integrate. This inhibits the ability of the warfighter to be skillfully tactile
  and dexterous during a mission. Altogether, these challenges may increase the physical
  and cognitive fatigue in an already challenging environment.    We are seeking innovative
  ideas for solutions that will increase warfighter mobility, dexterity and tactility,
  allowing the warfighter to complete all relevant tasks (including running, climbing,
  etc.) in a fast and comfortable manner, without cognitive/physiological fatigue
  associated with the ensemble.    We are also seeking ideas for heat management that
  reduce heat burden and actively cool the warfighter as various physical tasks are
  conducted. Finally, we welcome ideas that improve the seamless integration between
  suit components, such as mask-helmet or glove-boot interface. Ultimately, the solution
  must aid in protecting the warfighter against chemical and biological warfare agents
  and radiological particles. The goal is to relieve any burdens and hazards to the
  warfighter and improve operational capabilities in combating chemical and biological
  wartime threats.    The challenge consists of a 10-week idea submission period followed
  by a two-week blitz round for rapid refinement. Participants will compete for prizes
  within a $250,000 prize pot. The following prizes will be awarded:  <ul>    <li>Up
  to five small prize contest winners of up to $5,000 each*</li>    <li>Up to three
  runners-up winning up to $25,000 each*</li>    <li>Up to three finalists winning
  $50,000-$150,000*</li>    <li>For finalists who opt-in and meet further acceptability
  criteria:  <ul>    <li>Cooperative Research &amp; Development Agreement (CRADA)
  assessment and/or third party testing. Important Note: Solutions may be selected
  to test on a case-by-case basis given the feasibility to test the solution. The
  government reserves the right to not release the test data for any reason, including
  the data’s security classification. Data may not be made available to participants
  based on data security classification.</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  *The Joint Program
  Executive Office (JPEO) for Chemical and Biological Defense reserves the right to
  allocate fund amounts based on submission score.'
