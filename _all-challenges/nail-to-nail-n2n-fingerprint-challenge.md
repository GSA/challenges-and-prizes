  should not be more than 2 pages and should describe the anticipated solution with
  as much detail as possible.  The government will provide informal feedback on the
  application to the applicants.    <hr />    During future stages of this competition,
  outlined below, participants will be required to submit additional information.    <em>Stage
  2:  Development and Judging</em>    Builders will have until July 2017 to develop
  their solution for the N2N challenge.  Builders will be asked to submit sample fingerprint
  imagery from 3 subjects collected from their systems along with a short video of
  the system as a "proof of build" and certification to attend the Test and Evaluation
  (T&amp;E) event taking place in September 2017.  Devices will also be judged for
  safety at this time.  Builders who do not provide certification of intent to attend
  the T&amp;E event will be automatically disqualified from moving to Stage 3.   
  Winners may continue to further refine their devices prior to the live test.    Winners
  will be selected to participate in the Live Test  The videos produced by the builders
  will be evaluated along with an updated abstract  and sample imagery to determine
  participants selected for the next stage.    The submissions will be judged by a
  3 person USG team based on their content and not the quality of the video production. 
  The sample imagery may be used to confirm image standard compliance and interoperability
  with the USG API used for evaluation.  Additionally, the sample imagery will be
  used to determine a cursory measure of image quality.  The Judges will select the
  stage 2 winners based upon their assessment of the viability, novelty, and operational
  usefulness of the technology and the criteria for Stage 2 outlined below.  In the
  event that more entries are received than space is allocated, prize challenge balance
  may also be considered to ensure a diversity of approaches.    <em>Stage 3: Test
  &amp; Evaluation and Prize Awards</em>    The government will conduct a test where
  human subjects will present finger biometrics to the maker’s developed system. 
  To support testing, prize participants are responsible for operating their own capture
  device during the testing, ensuring safety and IRB compliance of the developed system
  with testing staff, and providing collected data in the specified format described
  in the N2N Fingerprint Image Format document for evaluation.    In the event that
  a participant is unable to produce a Print Data Set due to unforeseen circumstances,
  invited participants may still be eligible to receive a prize for completing Stage
  2 on the individual assessment of IARPA.    Testing will include collection of baseline
  data using current “gold standard” techniques for N2N, using a skilled operator,
  and latent fingerprints which will be collected by the government team.  Two baseline
  systems will be used to collect N2N data by the government.  Prize participants
  will collect N2N data from subjects without an operator. To be eligible to proceed
  to the evaluation stage and win the awards, makers are required to produce N2N data
  on 90% (less than 10% Failure to Acquire [FTA]) of the subjects provided without
  throwing away or filtering unacceptable data.  Participants are not allowed to intentionally
  throw away data that the system accepted and captured.  Captured data must include
  prints for all ten fingers to be considered complete.  Please note that prize participants
  are only required to provide N2N live data and will only be assessed on their N2N
  submissions.   All captured data must be provided and the amount produced will be
  determined by the total number of subjects who interacted with the device.  Makers
  must keep up with the pace of test subjects (approximately 5 minutes per subject
  to collect all required data) and ensure their collection process does not hinder
  the overall collection, impacting other participants.    Makers will need to operate
  their device in the MdTF.  At the facility, each team will be provided with a 3’x6’
  table, a 6-plug power strip, and a network cable to hook up to the test facility
  network.  All equipment for testing must fit on or under the provided table.  Makers
  will need to configure their device to send images to the facility collection API,
  which will also be used to calculate time per each participant.'

  Team with any questions, or to stay connected and follow the Challenge into Stage
  2 and 3, please contact the team at <a href="mailto:N2NChallenge@iarpa.gov">N2NChallenge@iarpa.gov</a>.    Registration
  is different than what had been discussed at participants’ day.  Participation is
  NOT a first come first served approach!  All participants who submit a registration
  form by the March 17 progress to Stage 2.    The Nail to Nail (N2N) Fingerprint
  Challenge seeks to identify fingerprint collection solutions able to acquire nail-to-nail
  image capture of the friction ridge surface without the need of a human operator.
  Collection of N2N, or rolled, fingerprint images allows for improved recognition
  performance in live and forensic matching scenarios. Traditionally, fingerprints
  can be grouped into three types: plain (or slap), rolled (or nail-to-nail), and
  latent (i.e., those found at a crime scene which must be developed through dusting,
  fuming, or other techniques). Plain prints represent information from only the center
  portion of the finger pad, whereas rolled prints represent information around the
  entirety of the finger pad, from one nail edge all the way around to the other nail
  edge. Latent prints are those left behind on a surface when the person is no longer
  present. Latent prints are typically partial or degraded in quality, due to the
  nature of how they are left behind or imprinted, unwittingly, on an object’s surface.    In
  traditional matching scenarios where plain or rolled prints are compared against
  one another, the larger surface area translates into more discriminative information
  for matching. For forensic applications, the larger surface area in the reference
  image increases the likelihood of obtaining sufficient overlap when matching partial
  latent fingerprints. Plain prints are easy to collect and typically don’t require
  operator assistance to produce good quality images for matching. While N2N prints
  provide superior information for matching, they are more difficult to collect than
  plain and require physically rolling the finger across a flat surface, often requiring
  assistance from a human operator. Having an operator involved in the process constrains
  the feasibility of collecting rolled prints in a variety of environments and operational
  scenarios. Removing the human-in-the-loop from this process through advanced collection
  and processing techniques will allow better fingerprint data to be collected, leading
  to improved recognition performance, while reducing the time and cost of collection.  <h4>Overview</h4>  The
  goal of the N2N Fingerprint Challenge is to improve biometric fingerprint collection
  and recognition systems by eliminating plain fingerprint captures. This challenge
  seeks to identify solutions which can perform live capture of N2N fingerprints without
  requiring a human operator1 for the purposes of matching against other latent or
  live capture of fingerprints. This unassisted N2N collection will allow for more
  distinguishing data to be collected while also alleviating the time and cost associated
  with using human operators. The developed system should collect fingerprint data
  that performs as good as, or better than, existing operator controlled N2N fingerprint
  collection approaches. Performance of the developed N2N collection systems will
  be evaluated using data collected from a live test using human subjects and encompasses
  both live and latent fingerprints. The participant collected data will be compared
  against “gold standard” N2N and latent data using conventional fingerprint recognition
  algorithms. Participants will be judged based on traditional biometric performance
  measures in addition to speed of the collection process. Participants are not required
  to develop algorithmic/software techniques to match N2N or latent data.    Participants
  are expected to design a system that will perform live capture of fully cooperative
  subjects. It is expected that subjects will be in close proximity to the device,
  as such, contactless or standoff systems are not required, but are still in scope
  if they meet the requirements for N2N collection. Systems may be facilitated by
  an observer, but the observer may not physically interact with the subject. Additionally,
  mechanical arms or other devices which “roll” the finger as a human operator traditionally
  would are out of scope but other mechanical components may be allowed.    The N2N
  Challenge is a three-stage process: 1) registration and feasibility review 2) system
  build and judging, and 3) Live Test: evaluation of performance. <strong><em>Note:
