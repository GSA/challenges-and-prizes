rules: '1) <em>Subject of Competition: </em>The Department of Energy (DOE) is
  seeking a new design to be used as the official logo of EV Everywhere.  EV Everywhere
  is the umbrella activity for DOE efforts to increase the use of plug-in electric
  vehicles (PEVs).  Its mission is to raise awareness of the benefits of PEVs,
  help individuals realize that PEVs are a viable option for them, and position
  DOE as the definitive resource for unbiased, objective information about PEVs.    EV
  Everywhere supports DOE’s larger goal of reducing the use of petroleum in transportation
  to increase energy and environmental security.  In addition to public outreach
  and education, it also includes efforts to reduce the cost and improve the convenience
  of PEVs through research and development as well as increase community readiness
  for the use of PEVs. For further information, contact <a href="mailto:ev-everywhere@ee.doe.gov">ev-everywhere@ee.doe.gov</a>.    &nbsp;    <br>2)
  <em>Dates: </em>The submission period for entries begins at August 13, 2015
  and must be received electronically by September 25, 2015 by 11:59 p.m. EST.
  The winning contestant will be announced October 26, 2015.  All dates are subject
  to change.  The winning contestant will be notified in advance of the public
  announcement.    &nbsp;    <br>3) <em>Eligibility Rules for Participating in the
  Competition:</em> To be eligible to win a prize under this Logo Design Competition,
  you-    (a) Must register to participate in the competition under the link designated
  for that purpose by DOE on https://www.challenge.gov;    (b) Must comply with
  all the requirements under this notice and the America COMPETES Reauthorization
  Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-358);    (c) In the case of an individual, whether
  participating singly or in a group, must be a citizen or permanent resident
  of the United States before the submission period ends;    (d) In the case of
  a private entity shall be incorporated in and maintain a principal place of
  business in the United States;    (e) May not be a Federal employee acting within
  the scope of your employment;    (f) May not be an entity with an outstanding,
  unresolved financial obligation to, or that is currently suspended or debarred
  by, the federal government; and    (g) If chosen as the winner of the prize,
  provide to DOE the necessary personal or business information to allow DOE to
  award the cash prize.    If you are under 18 years of age, you must have the
  permission of a parent or legal guardian to participate. If you are a Federal
  grantee, you may not use Federal funds to develop applications for this competition
  unless such use is consistent with the purpose of your grant award. If you are
  a Federal contractor, you may not use Federal funds from a contract to develop
  or fund efforts in support of applications for this competition. You may use
  Federal facilities or consult with Federal employees during the competition
  if the facilities and employees are made available to all contestants participating
  in the competition on an equitable basis.    &nbsp;    <br>4) <em>Registration Process
  for Contestants:</em> Design competition contestants must submit their “EV Everywhere”
  Logo designs online as a vector-based image in an .ai, .eps, or PDF file using
  the link designated for that purpose on https://www.challenge.gov. Contestants
  can find the link on https://challenge.gov, either by filtering search criteria
  to “Department of Energy” or going to https://www.vehicles.energy.gov, where
  the link will be posted. DOE will accept logo design competition submissions
  only through https://www.challenge.gov.    Things to keep in mind as you design
  your “EV Everywhere” Logo:    a) The logo should translate the core elements
  of the EV Everywhere brand, including the benefits of PEVs, the viability of
  PEVs for the average driver, and EV Everywhere as the source for objective,
  data-driven, reliable information on PEVs. DOE’s <a href="http://www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric.html">Alternative
  Fuels Data Center</a> describes the basic technology of PEVs and PEVs’ major
  benefits;    b) In addition, the logo can evoke through imagery ideas of: electricity,
  the “fun” factor of PEVs, PEVs’ cost savings, environmental sustainability,
  and energy security;    c) The use of the words “EV Everywhere” is recommended,
  but not required;    d) The use of the words “U.S. Department of Energy” is
  required;    e) The logo should use the following colors alone or in combination:  <ol>   <li>As
  primary, dark blue (Pantone 308; CMYK C100 M19 Y8 K46; RGB R0 G91 B130; HEX
  005B82) and/or dark green (Pantone 356; CMYK C95 M8 Y93 K27; RGB R0 G121 B52;
  HEX 007934)</li>   <li>As highlights, light blue (Pantone 2995; CMYK C87 M1
  Y0 K0; RGB R0 G169 B224; HEX 1F82BB), light green (Pantone 368; CMYK C63 M0
  Y97 K0; RGB R105 G190 B40; HEX 69BE28), yellow (Pantone 116; CMYK C0 M12 Y100
  K0; RGB R254 G203 B0; HEX FECB00), red (Pantone 158; CMYK C0 M64 Y95 K0; RGB
  R227 G114 B34; HEX E37222), and light gray (Pantone 428; CMYK C12 M6 Y5 K12;
  RGB R195 G200 B200; HEX C3C8C8)</li>  </ol>  f) If the logo includes text, the
  text should be in Gotham font, or if not available, Calibri;    g) The logo
  should be unique enough that it could be easily recognized by the general public
  in the future;    h) Because it will be used on a vehicle magnetic logo the
  size of a small bumper sticker, the logo needs to be readable and/or understandable
  from the back of a moving vehicle.    i) The logo should not focus solely on
  light-duty PEVs; and    j) The logo should not conflict or be too similar to
  existing DOE/EERE logos (available on the <a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/communicationstandards/logos.html">EERE
  Communications Standards website</a>) or use elements of the DOE or any other
  federal agency’s logo.    When uploading your “EV Everywhere” Logo design, in
  the “Submission Text” field, please include a brief description about your logo
  entry and thought process behind the design, including any personal experience
  the designer has with PEVs.    &nbsp;    <br>5) <em>Prize for Winner</em>: The winning
  contestant will be awarded a $5,000 prize and the design will become the official
  logo for the EV Everywhere activities, the magnetic decals, the program’s website
  and any official DOE purpose.    &nbsp;    <br>6) <em>Selection of Winner</em>:
  DOE will select a judging panel that will consist of DOE officials, EV industry
  leaders, and other communications experts. Judges will be fair and impartial.
  A judge may not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee,
  officer, director, or agent of any contestant or have a familial or financial
  relationship with a contestant.    Judges will use the following weighted criteria
  to judge the submitted designs:    (a) Effectiveness of communicating the EV
  Everywhere mission and brand (500/1000 points).  This includes the idea of plug-in
  electric vehicles, their benefits, their viability for the average driver, and
  the DOE as a source of unbiased, data-driven information. This may be done through
  a realistic or abstract design;    (b) Creativity and originality (300/1000
  points). Is the visual quality of the design at once informative and representative
  of imagery connected to EV Everywhere; and    (c) Design can be easily replicated,
  especially as a magnetic decal (200/1000 points). Can this design be replicated
  successfully, without excessive cost, for many media formats.    The judging
  panel will evaluate the submissions and choose the final winning design from
  all submissions.  In the event that no entries fully meet the above criteria
  to the panel''s satisfaction, the Department of Energy is under no obligation
  to select a winner.  All decisions by DOE are final and binding with respect
  to the contest.  For questions or further information, please see the contact
  information listed in the <strong>DATES</strong> section above.    &nbsp;    <br>7)

  1) that plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are beneficial and practical and <br>2) EV
  Everywhere is the place for drivers to come for data-driven, objective information
  about them. As PEVs can help increase America’s economic, energy, and environmental
  security, the Department of Energy and its stakeholders will be leading the way
  through EV Everywhere.</p><p>The competition is only the first part of an expanded outreach
  and education effort to increase consumer awareness of PEVs’ benefits. The winning
  logo will be featured in EV Everywhere communications products, potentially including
  a magnetic decal, the program’s website and any other official Department of Energy
  purpose.</p><p>The winner has been selected for the EV
