description: "<p>The Furthering Advancements to Shorten Time (FAST) Commissioning
  for Pumped-Storage Hydropower (PSH) Prize aims to attract ideas to reduce the time,
  cost, and risk required to commission PSH projects. This is the first prize of its
  kind and is structured to support anyone with a great idea and the motivation to
  develop their idea into a full business concept.</p>\r\n<p>Today's electricity system
  is changing rapidly and hydropower and PSH have an essential role in contributing
  to the resilience, reliability, and affordability of the U.S. power system. PSH
  is by far the largest source of energy storage on the grid, and it will play a key
  role in supporting increased integration of variable generation resources. But large
  capital investments and long lead times for PSH commissioning are deterrents to
  would-be developers and utilities.</p>\r\n<p>The goal of the prize is to catalyze
  new solutions, designs, and strategies to accelerate PSH development by reducing
  the time, cost and risk to commission PSH. Ideas could include innovative PSH ideas,
  new layouts, creative construction management, improved construction equipment,
  application of advanced manufacturing, or standardization of equipment.</p>\r\n<p>Finalists
  will receive vouchers for up to 50 hours of support from one of four DOE national
  laboratories to prepare for a pitch contest which will result in up to 3 winners
  and up to $550,000 of combined cash prizes and voucher support.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Detailed
  Timeline:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Concept stage submission deadline: May 24,
