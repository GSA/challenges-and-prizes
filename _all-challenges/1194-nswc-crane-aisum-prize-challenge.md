  Artificial Intelligence for Small Unit Maneuver (AISUM) combines Naval
  Expeditionary Warfare and Special Operations Forces (SOF) tactical maneuver
  elements with Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS) to create a low risk human
  machine maneuver element that gains, maintains and extends access in complex,
  contested and congested areas, providing a decisive advantage and precision
  application of effects.


  Over the past 20 years the SOF community perfected the combination of its tactical maneuver elements and small arms precision fire with overhead unmanned and remotely piloted airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) in its aerial delivered strike to precisely find, fix and finish networked threats. However, these non-state actors mostly operated in a two-dimensional battlespace that was mainly rural and urban sprawl, with little to no access to Electronic Warfare (EW) tools. 


  Though the Special Operations community have become masters of the 2-dimensional threat environment over the past two decades, with today’s emerging threat environments, adversaries attempt to contest all domains with advanced technologies and take advantage of the complex and congested 3-dimensional battlespace. This reduces the effectiveness of SOF tactical maneuver elements, ISR and precision fires, creating the inability to maintain continuous airborne ISR feeds and key communications and navigation bands in the electromagnetic spectrum in these dense urban clutter environments, leaving our tactical maneuver elements challenged.


  For example, in a mission to infiltrate and obtain information or an asset from a sub terrain tunnel system in a contested and congested threat environment, AISUM could be used to gain intelligence and minimize human risk.  Conceptually, satellite imagery would provide the initial data used to generate a 3-dimensional terrain map of an area of operations, allowing mission planners, operators and drones to plan, train and rehearse within the simulated environment. These activities allow the team to develop and optimize specific tactics, techniques and procedures. 


  **General Overview**


  This Prize Challenge reaches out to the defense, academic and industrial community to enhance research and development in the field of artificial intelligence for small unit maneuver. The objective of the Prize Challenge is for the development of an algorithm to enhance the maneuver and reconnaissance capabilities of autonomous drones within defined scenarios. The objective includes the utilization of the Government Furnished Property (GFP) drones, sensors, and onboard processing.


  Example Scenario 1:


  1. Maneuver: Begin mission at entrance to building. Navigate through the building using open passages and any route to exit through open rear door.

  2. Recon: Identify and count the number of key predefined objects, and simple properties (i.e. color) within the internal space (TBD: humans, object of interest)


  Example Scenario 2:


  1. Maneuver: Begin mission at entrance to building. Navigate through the building, around limited obstacles in order to maximize coverage, and then exit through open rear door.

  2. Mapping: Collect data of internal space to produce, post-hoc, a 3D model of the internal environment.

  3. Recon: Identify the number and location of key predefined objects within the internal space (TBD: humans, object of interest).

  4. Recon: Identify numbers of civilians vs combatants (threat / no-threat) within internal space. (TBD: identifying characteristics)


  The AISUM Prize Challenge is broken into three phases; technical white paper submission, virtual simulation environment, and live scenario at a military training site. 


  Phase I will be conducted in two phases: Initial submission of White Paper Concept followed by an invitation to provide Virtual Presentation of the White Paper Concept. The White Paper Concept shall describe the details of the technical approach in response to the problem statement. 


  White Paper Concept should be developed around the following conditions: 


  * GFP will consist of stretch X drone, onboard processing, frontal camera, and optical avoidance sensors

  * Operation in a Non-GPS environment and an autonomous flight mode

  * Additional hardware payload proposals may be considered


  The Government will select up to 25 White Papers Concept(s) for invitation for a Virtual Presentation of their proposed concept to a panel of judges.  The Virtual Presentation shall provide a summary of the White Paper Concept and include detail on how participants intend to accomplish the Prize Challenge objective. Up to 10 winners will be selected to participate in Phase II.


  Phase II participants shall develop specific algorithms that will be used to compete in virtual scenarios. The participants will be evaluated for their algorithms to be used within a Government provided virtual map. 


  GFP Includes:


  * Microsoft Research AIRSIM environment for autonomous system using UE Unreal Engine Version 4 

  * Map will be an open environment containing a multi-story, multiple room building 


  Up to 10 winners will be selected to participate in Phase III. 


  Phase III participants will utilize their developed algorithms with the provided drone and compete in real life scenarios. 


  * GFP will consist of stretch X drone, onboard processing, frontal camera, and optical avoidance sensors 

  * Operation in a Non-GPS environment and an autonomous flight mode


  All winner(s) will be determined at the end of this phase.

**Terms & Conditions**

These terms and conditions apply to all participants in the Challenge. 

**Agreement to Terms.** By responding to this announcement, the participant agrees to comply with and be bound by the rules (including these terms and conditions) of this prize challenge and the decisions of the Government. The final scores and final determination of Winner is final and binding on all Participants.  The final scores of the Judging Panel and the final determination of Winner may not be challenged by the Participants.

**Security Requirements.** By responding to this announcement, the participant agrees to comply with the DoDM 5200.01 (all volumes) and any revisions to this manual. 

**Participation by Government Support Contractors.** Government support contractors will assist in the review of any data provided by participants. A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) has been signed by the support contractors with the Government that precludes them from disclosing any proprietary data outside of the Government. If participants desire a separate NDA with the Government support contractors, participants should submit a NDA form, along with instructions, with their initial qualification application. 

**Follow-On Acquisition.** At the Government’s discretion, the Government may choose to award a FAR-base procurement contract, Other Transaction Authority (OTA) award (under 10 U.S.C 2371 or 2371b), a procurement contract for experimental purposes (10 U.S.C. 2373) or a combination of awards under those authorities to any chosen participant in this prize challenge. If the Government chooses to award an OTA award under 10 USC 2371b, the Government may also decide to award a follow-on production OTA award using the same authority.

**Malware.** Each participant warrants that any submission is virus free and free of malware. 

**Data Rights and Marking.** All data submitted under the Prize Challenge will be made available to NSWC-CR and parties authorized to act on behalf of the NSWC-CR as discussed below. By accepting these Terms and Conditions, the Participant consents to the use of data submitted to NSWC-CR. Any materials submitted to NSWC-CR as part of a prize challenge submission become NSWC-CR records and will not be returned.

The use of protective markings such as “Do Not Publicly Release – Trade Secret” or “Do Not Publicly Release – Confidential Proprietary Business Information” in the Header or Footer of the Submission is strongly encouraged where appropriate.  However, Participants should be aware that the use of protective markings is not dispositive as to whether information will be released publicly pursuant to a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act, (FOIA) 5 U.S.C. §552, et. seq., as amended by the OPEN Government Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110-175. Any information received from the Participant is considered to be a federal agency record, and as such, subject to public release under FOIA.  Decisions to disclose or withhold information received from a Participant are based on the applicability of one or more of the nine FOIA exemptions, not on the existence or nonexistence of protective markings.  All FOIA requests received by NSWC-CR are processed in accordance with 10 C.F.R. Part 1004.  Participants will be notified of any FOIA requests for their submissions in accordance with 29 C.F.R. § 70.26.  Participants may then have the opportunity to review materials and work with a NSWC-CR FOIA representative prior to the release of materials.
