  are required to generate similarity scores (a larger value indicates greater similarity)

  competition have been provided with the testing set. From the data, the participants
  are required to generate and submit similarity matrices of size 7771 X 7771, the
  size of the testing data. The ordering of test images is same in both row and column.

description: '<p>With recent advancements in deep learning, the capabilities of automatic
  face recognition has been significantly increased. However, face recognition in
  unconstrained environment with non-cooperative users is still a research challenge,
  pertinent for users such as law enforcement agencies. While several covariates such
  as pose, expression, illumination, aging, and low resolution have received significant
  attention, “disguise” is still considered an arduous covariate of face recognition.
  Disguise as a covariate involves both intentional and unintentional changes on a
  face through which one can either obfuscate his/her identity or impersonate someone
  else’s identity. The problem can be further exacerbated due to unconstrained environment
  or “in the wild” scenarios. However, disguise in the wild has not been studied in
  a comprehensive way, primarily due to unavailability of such as database. As part
  of 1<sup>st</sup> International Workshop on Disguised Face in the Wild at CVPR 2018,
  a competition is being held in which participants are asked to show their results
  on the Disguised Faces in the Wild (DFW) database.  More details on the workshop
  and competition are available at: <a href="http://iab-rubric.org/DFW/dfw.html">http://iab-rubric.org/DFW/dfw.html</a>.</p>
  <p>Prize awards for the DFW 2018 Competition are provided by the Intelligence Advanced Research
  Projects Activity (IARPA), within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence
  (ODNI).<br>    <strong>Two phases of the competition and winners:</strong>    The competition
  involves two phases. The early phase involves the participants with early access
  to the data with an opportunity to submit a paper describing their approach. The
  second phase participants will have more time to submit their score results but
  will not be able to submit a written paper. However, the second phase participants
  may be invited to orally present their work based on their performance results at
  the CVPR workshop.  Teams may elect to participate in either or both phases.</p>
  <p><strong>Phase 1:</strong>  <ul>    <li><strong>Enrollment
  deadline for the overall competition:</strong> February 23, 2018</li>    <li><strong>Result
  Submissions due to Organizers:</strong> March 05, 2018 - UPDATED</li>    <li><strong>Invitation
  to top performing participants for paper submission (results will not be released
  publicly):</strong> Mar 07, 2018</li>    <li><strong>Paper submissions by selected
  Competition Participants due to organizers:</strong> Mar 20, 2018</li>    <li><strong>Notification
  provided authors:</strong> Apr 05, 2018</li>    <li><strong>Camera-ready deadline:</strong>
  Apr 09, 2018</li>  </ul>  <strong>Phase
  2:</strong>  <ul>    <li><strong>Final results submissions to Organizers:</strong>
  May 01, 2018</li>    <li><strong>Winners of the competition announced based on final
  Comparative Results:</strong> May 10, 2018</li>  </ul></p>
  <p>Results will be announced
  at the end of Phase 2 based on submission received up until the May 1<sup>st</sup>
  deadline. Participants are permitted to submit one set of results to Phase 1 and
  then resubmit a second set of revised/final results to Phase 2.  No paper submission
  is possible for participants who <strong>only</strong> participate in Phase 2, but
  winners will be invited to give an oral presentation on their work at the CVPR workshop.    <strong>Questions?</strong>    In
  case of any difficulties or questions, please email to <a href="mailto:rsingh@iiitd.ac.in">rsingh@iiitd.ac.in</a>.</p>'
