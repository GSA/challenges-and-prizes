rules: "<p>The event website and official rules are posted at <a href=\"http://www.nist.gov/ariac\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.nist.gov/ariac</a>.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Eligibility
  to Participate&nbsp;</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Participation in the ARIAC Prize Competition
  is open to ALL; however, not all participants are eligible to win cash prizes
  as explained in the next section.</p>\r\n<p>Each Competition Participant (individual,
  team, or legal entity) is required to register on the ARIAC website. There shall
  be one Official Representative for each Competition Participant. The Official
  Representative must provide a name, username (which may serve as a team or affiliation
  name), email address, and affirm that he/she has read and consents to be governed
  by the Competition Rules. Multiple registrations per Participant are NOT allowed.
  At NIST&rsquo;s discretion, any violation of this rule will be grounds for disqualification
  from the Competition. Multiple individuals and/or legal entities may collaborate
  as a team to submit a single entry (Participant&rsquo;s code submission to a
  qualifier or final), in which case the designated Official Representative will
  be responsible for meeting all entry and evaluation requirements. Participation
  is subject to all U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. Participants
  must not be suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded from doing business with
  the Federal Government. Individuals entering on behalf of or representing a
  company, institution or other legal entity are responsible for confirming that
  their entry does not violate any policies of that company, institution or legal
  entity. Any other individuals or legal entities involved with the design, production,
  execution, distribution or evaluation of ARIAC are not eligible to participate.</p>\r\n<p>Once
  registered, Participants will have access to the interfaces needed to participate
  in the competition through the ARIAC website. NIST will create an account to
  allow the Participants to upload their submissions to the qualifier. Modifications
  and improvements to a Participant&rsquo;s control system during the qualifying
  period are to be expected, but the Participant should have one final control
  system ready for the final competition.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Elibility to Win
  a Cash Prize</strong></h4>\r\n<p>To be eligible for a cash prize:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A
  Participant (whether an individual, team, or legal entity) must have registered
  to participate and complied with all of the requirements under section 3719
  of title 15, United States Code as contained herein.</li>\r\n<li>At the time
  of Entry, the Official Representative (individual or team lead, in the case
  of a group project) must be age 18 or older and a U.S. citizen or permanent
  resident of the United States or its territories.</li>\r\n<li>In the case of
  a private entity, the business shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary
  place of business in the United States or its territories.</li>\r\n<li>Participants
  may not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their
  employment. NIST employees are not eligible to participate. Non-NIST Federal
  employees acting in their personal capacities should consult with their respective
  agency ethics officials to determine whether their participation in this Competition
  is permissible.</li>\r\n<li>A Participant shall not be deemed ineligible because
  the Participant consulted with Federal employees or used Federal facilities
  in preparing its submission to the ARIAC Prize Competition if the Federal employees
  and facilities are made available to all Participants on an equitable basis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In
  addition, interested Participants who do not meet the eligibility requirements
  to win a prize (i.e., individuals who are neither a US citizen nor a permanent
  resident of the United States or non-US-based entities) are encouraged to participate
  in the Competition. They are invited to register on the ARIAC website and download
  the training material. The performance obtained by these Participants will be
  displayed on the ARIAC website in the same manner as the performance obtained
  by Participants who are eligible to win cash prizes.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Judging
  Panel</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The NIST Director will appoint a panel of three qualified
  judges. The Judges will be robot agility and/or simulation experts from inside
  and/or outside of NIST. The Judges will determine winners according to the Judging
  Criteria described herein. The Judges may not have personal or financial interests
  in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of, any entity that is a
  registered Participant in the Competition and may not have a familial or financial
  relationship with an individual who is a registered Participant. In the event
  of such a conflict, a Judge must recuse himself or herself and a new Judge may
  be appointed.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Basis on which Finalists and Winners Will Be
  Selected</strong></h4>\r\n<p>A portion of the scores will be automatically calculated,
  shared with the Participants, and publicly posted for each Trial at the conclusion
  of the Finals (after all Trials are run) as a combination of cost and performance
  metrics, described below in the Trial Score Calculation section. A Participant&rsquo;s
  final automated score is the sum of scores for each of the 15 competition Trials.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Environment</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The
  simulation environment is a representation of an industrial kitting work cell
  with two robot arms, a conveyor belt, part bins, and trays.</p>\r\n<p>The conveyor
  belt is a 1 m wide plane that transports objects across the work environment
  at a fixed speed of roughly 0.2 m/s. Parts continuously appear on the belt for
  the duration of the trial. When parts reach the end of the conveyor belt they
  are automatically removed. Teams can control the conveyor belt during development,
  but not during the final competition.</p>\r\n<p>There are eight part bins that
  may be used for building kits. Parts in these bins will not be replaced once
  used.</p>\r\n<p>There are two robot arms mounted on a linear actuator that operates
  parallel to the conveyor belt. The linear actuator measures 4 m.</p>\r\n<p>Two
  automated guided vehicles (AGV) are located at either end of the linear actuator.
  Kits are built on top of these AGVs. A team will programmatically signal the
  AGVs when the kits are ready to be taken away. The signaled AGV will depart
  for a short period and then return with an empty tray.</p>\r\n<p>The trays used
  for assembling kits are flat trays measuring 0.5 x 0.7 m.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Robot
  Arm</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The two robot arms used in each trial will be Universal
  Robots UR10.</p>\r\n<p>The robot arms&rsquo; position is controlled through
  the linear actuator on which it is mounted.</p>\r\n<p>The end of the arms are
  equipped with a vacuum gripper. The vacuum gripper is controlled in a binary
  manner and reports whether or not it is successfully gripping an object.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Sensors</strong></h4>\r\n<p>A
  team can place sensors around the environment. Each sensor has a cost that factors
  into the final score. Available sensors are:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Break beam:
  reports when a beam is broken by an object. It does not provide distance information.</li>\r\n<li>Laser
  scanner: provides an array of distances to a sensed object.</li>\r\n<li>Cognex
  logical camera: provides information about the pose and type of all models within
  its field of view.</li>\r\n<li>Proximity: detects the range to an object.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4><strong>Order</strong></h4>\r\n<p>An
  order is an instruction containing kits for the robot system to complete. Each
  order will specify the kit to be assembled, i.e. the list of parts to be put
  in the kit. Each specified part has the following structure:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The
  type of part.</li>\r\n<li>The position and orientation of the part on the tray.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4><strong>Faulty
  parts</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Above each AGV is a quality control sensor that detects
  faulty parts. If faulty parts are detected while teams are filling trays, those
  parts should be removed from the tray and replaced with another part of the
  same type. Faulty parts are considered unwanted parts: they will not count for
  any points when the kit is submitted, and they will cost teams the all-parts
  bonus if left in trays.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Scoring</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Scores
  will be automatically calculated for each trial as a combination of performance
  metrics and costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Competition Process</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Each
  trial will consist of the following steps:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The robots programmatically
  signal that they are able to begin accepting orders.</li>\r\n<li>The first Order
  (Order 1) is sent to the robots.</li>\r\n<li>A fixed amount of time is allowed
  to complete the order.</li>\r\n<li>In the case of the Dropped Part testing method,
  up to three parts will be forcibly dropped from the gripper.</li>\r\n<li>In
  the case of the In-Process Kit Change testing method, a new Order (Order 2)
  will be issued that is of higher priority than the previously issued Order 1.
  When Order 2 is complete, building of Order 1 is to resume.</li>\r\n<li>The
  robots signal programmatically when a kit is complete and ready for quality
  control.</li>\r\n<li>The robot system will be notified that the trial is over.
  The trial is over when time runs out or all Orders have been fulfilled.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4><strong>Cost
  Metrics</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The following values are calculated for a Participant&rsquo;s
  system setup. As Participants are to use the same system setup for all Trials,
  the values will remain unchanged between Trials.</p>\r\n<p>The choices made
  by the competitors (choices of sensors) will have a specific cost associated
  with them. The final cost for individual sensors will be made available to the
  Participants at least two weeks before the Finals. For planning purposes, Participants
  should use:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>$500 for each logical camera used.</li>\r\n<li>$200
  for each depth camera used.</li>\r\n<li>$100 for each other sensor used (e.g.,
  break beam, proximity, laser scanner).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The sum of these
  cost choices made by each team will be divided by a baseline cost of $1700 and
  made into a cost factor for the scoring. The team costs are designated as TC,
  and the baseline cost is designated as BC. The cost factor, is then calculated
  as:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/ids-images/ARIAC-Cost-Metrics.png\"
  width=\"150\" /></p>\r\n<h4><strong>Completion Score</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Performance
  metrics that cover both completion and efficiency are calculated for each Trial
  separately. Completion captures the quality of the orders fulfilled (that the
  boxes contain the correct products in the correct position/orientations); efficiency
  captures the responsiveness in fulfilling orders (that the orders were filled
  quickly).</p>\r\n<p>Each trial, since it has the option to have more than one
  order, will have a certain set of scores for each order. Each order consists
  of a list of products needed and a prescribed position and orientation for each
  product within the box. The completion score, CS, is a combined score for each
  order, starting with 1 point for each product that is placed in the box. For
  each product that is within 3 cm of the correct position, and within 0.1 radians
  of the correct orientation will result in an additional point. Next, since the
  main focus of the competition is to have fulfilled orders, any order with all
  of the products in the confines of the box and in the correct position/orientation
  receives an additional point for each product. So, for an order sj with i products
  in it would have a maximum score of:</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/ids-images/ARIAC-Completion-Score.png\"
  width=\"150\" /></p>\r\n<h4><strong>Efficiency Factor</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The
  Efficiency of the approaches chosen by the teams are accounted for in the scoring
  by using the times that each team takes to complete each trial. The times are
  counted in seconds from the start of the trial until the first kit is completed
  and is designated as T01. In the trials with multiple orders, the time, Tj is
  counted in seconds from the time that the jth order is sent to the team. For
  each trial, an average of the times for each team (ATj) is compared to the individual
  team time to calculate the Efficiency Factor:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If a team&rsquo;s
  system times out for a trial, the efficiency factor for the trial is set to
  0 and the trial time is not used to calculate the average times for that trial.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For
  the multi-order trials where one of the orders is a high priority order, an
  additional multiplier, h, is applied with the efficiency factor to give a higher
  proportion of the score to that order, which is initially set to a value of
  3. The final h value will be made available to the Participants at least two
  weeks before the finals.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/ids-images/ARIAC-Efficiency-Factor.png\"
  width=\"200\" /></p>\r\n<h4><strong>Trial Score Calculation</strong></h4>\r\n<p>All
  of the scoring factors described above are combined as shown below to calculate
  the score for each trial:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/ids-images/ARIAC-Trial-Score-Calculation.png\"
  width=\"600\" /></p>\r\n<h4><strong>Final Score Calculation</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The
  final overall score is the equally weighted sum of all trial scores. As mentioned
  in the Competition Scenarios section, trials are expected to focus on the Baseline
  Kit Building, Dropped Part, and In-Process Kit Change scenarios, among others.</p>\r\n<p>The
  Winners of cash prizes will be determined by three Judges appointed by the NIST
  Director, using the Judging Criteria outlined herein.</p>\r\n<p>NIST will announce
  the Finalists via the Event Website as well as those Finalists that have been
  awarded a cash award (each, an &ldquo;Award&rdquo;). The anticipated number
  and amount of the Awards that will be awarded for this Competition is set forth
  in these rules; however, NIST is not obligated to make all or any Awards, and
  reserves the right to award fewer than the anticipated number of Awards in the
  event an insufficient number of eligible Participants meet any one or more of
  the Judging Criteria for this Competition, based on NIST&rsquo;s sole discretion.
  Using the Judging Criteria described herein, three qualified Judges (appointed
  by the NIST Director) will determine the winners of the ARIAC Prize Competition.</p>\r\n<p>The
  winner verification process for being eligible to receive an Award includes
  providing the full legal name, tax identification number or social security
  number, routing number and banking account to which the prize money can be deposited
  directly. Return of any notification as &ldquo;undeliverable&rdquo; will result
  in disqualification. The verification form must be returned within seven (7)
  calendar days of receipt. After verification of eligibility, Awards will be
  distributed in the form of electronic funds transfer addressed to the Official
  Representatives specified in the winning Entries. That Official Representative
  will have sole responsibility for further distribution of any Award among Participants
  in a group Entry or within a company or institution that has submitted an Entry
  through that representative. The list of Entries receiving Awards for the Competition,
  including the names of all members of a team, will be made public according
  to the timeline outlined on the Event Website.</p>\r\n<p>Winners are responsible
  for all taxes and reporting related to any Award received as part of the Competition.</p>\r\n<p>All
  costs incurred in the preparation of Competition Entries are to be borne by
  Participants.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Presentation of Winning Approaches at a To-Be-Determined
  Workshop in a Robotics Conference</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Up to three Winners of
  the ARIAC Competition may be invited by NIST to attend a workshop dedicated
  to the ARIAC Competition at a future TBD robotics conference. The Winners will
  be required to make a 25-minute presentation on their approach in the ARIAC
  Competition followed by audience question and answer.</p>\r\n<p>NIST may arrange
  and pay for the travel for one team-selected representative from each of the
  winning Participants to cover eligible travel costs such as airfare, conference
  registration fee, and lodging.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Point of Contact for the Competition</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Questions

description: "<p>The Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation Competition, ARIAC,
  addresses a critical limitation of robots used in industrial environments like factory
  floors: They are not as agile as they need to be.</p>\r\n<p>Many robots are not
  able to quickly detect failures or recover from those failures. They aren't able
  to sense changes in their environment and modify their actions accordingly. Programming
  these robots for even the simplest tasks takes time and effort. Help solve this
  problem by coding your own robot control system (software) that can outperform everyone
  else's in a simulated environment! Compete to win $17,500 in cash prizes and the
  opportunity to showcase your solution at a future robotics conference.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Background</strong></h4>\r\n<p>In
  June 2017, the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) put on the first
  ARIAC Competition. The goal of the competition was to test the agility of industrial
  robot systems, with the goal of enabling industrial robots on the shop floors to
  be more productive, more autonomous, and to require less time from shop floor workers.
  For the second year of the competition, we introduced a cash prize to motivate and
  expand participation. This is the third year of the competition.</p>\r\n<p>In this
  context, agility is defined broadly to address:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Failure identification
  and recovery, where robots can detect failures in a manufacturing process and automatically
  recover from those failures</li>\r\n<li>Automated planning, to minimize (or eliminate)
  the up-front robot programming time when a new task is introduced</li>\r\n<li>Fixtureless
  environment, where robots can sense the environment and perform tasks on parts that
  are not in predefined locations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Participants are required to
  develop a robot control system (software) to control a robot in a simulated environment.
  Gazebo (<a href=\"http://www.gazebosim.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.gazebosim.com</a>),
  which is an open source robotics simulation environment, will be used as the testing
  platform and the Robot Operating Systems (ROS), which is an open source set of software
  libraries and tools, will be used to define the interfaces to the simulation system.</p>\r\n<p>Software
  interfaces will be made publicly available that will allow the Participants to control
  the robot. There will be one qualifier in the April 2019 timeframe with the final
  competition occurring in mid-May 2019. The competition will be performed virtually
  in the cloud, so physical attendance is not required to compete. NIST is proposing
  a workshop to a major robotics conference to allow the winning Participants to present
  their approaches; details, when available, will be posted to the official challenge
  website. See full details in <em><strong>How to Enter.</strong></em></p>\r\n<h4><strong>Dates
  of the Competition</strong></h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Qualifier Begin: April 15, 2019</li>\r\n<li>Qualifier
  End: April 19, 2019</li>\r\n<li>Competition Testing (Finals) Period Begins: May
  13, 2019</li>\r\n<li>Competition Testing (Finals) Period Ends: 5:00 PM, May 17,
  2019</li>\r\n<li>Announcement of Cash Prize Winners: May 21, 2019</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><strong>Competition
  Scenarios</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The following terminology is frequently used in this
  document</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Order: A list of parts and their goal location on a
  tray.</li>\r\n<li>Part: One element of an order.</li>\r\n<li>Tray: A surface that
  hold parts.</li>\r\n<li>Kit: A tray and set of parts that make up an order.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>ARIAC
  requires participants to complete a series of tests centered in an industrial scenario
  that are based around building kits made up of particular parts. The robot system
  will work within the environment specified in the work environment section.</p>\r\n<p>There
  are three different test scenarios that all involve moving parts from a supply location
  to a tray. The possible supply locations are a conveyor belt, and stationary bins.
  Challenges will be introduced in each scenario. Details about the scenarios follow.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Scenario
  1:</strong>&nbsp;Baseline Kit Building: The first scenario is intended as a baseline
  set of tasks for the other test methods to be compared against. The task for this
  scenario is to pick specific parts and place them on a tray. The robot arms will
  receive an &ldquo;Order&rdquo; that details the list of parts and their target locations.
  Orders are covered in more detail in the Orders section.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Scenario
  2:</strong>&nbsp;Dropped Part: The task for Scenario 2 is identical to Scenario
  1, however one or more parts will drop from the robots&rsquo; gripper. The robots
  will need to recover after dropping a part and complete the given Order. Recovery
  could entail picking up the dropped part or fetching a new part.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Scenario
  3:</strong>&nbsp;In-Process Kit Change: While the robots are in the middle of assembling
  a kit, a new high priority order will be received that needs to be completed as
  fast as possible. The robots will need to decide how best to complete this new order,
  and then complete the previous order.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The competition will consist
  of 15 trials: 5 trials of each of the 3 scenarios. Each trial will receive a score
  based on completion and efficiency metrics outlined in the Scoring section.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Winners</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Up
  to three winners will be selected. The Prize Purse for the ARIAC Prize Competition
  is a total of $17,500. In addition, each winner may be able to select any one representative
  from their team to present their results at a robotics conference in 2019 in a workshop
  dedicated to the ARIAC competition. NIST may be able to provide travel funds subject
  to availability.&nbsp; The number of winners will be fewer than three if there are
  fewer than three Participants that qualify for the competition. The Prize Purse
  may increase, but will not decrease. Any increases in the Prize Purse will be posted
  on the Event Website. NIST reserves the right to announce additional winners of
  non-cash prizes.</p>"
