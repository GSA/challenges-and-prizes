  EPA is partnering with the U.S. Department of Defense’s Strategic
  Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) and Environmental
  Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP); the Environmental Council
  of States (ECOS) and the Environmental Research Institute of the States
  (ERIS); Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy; and the
  Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, to launch a technical
  challenge regarding the destruction of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
  (PFAS). The challenge asks Solvers to submit detailed plans for a
  non-incineration way of destroying PFAS in concentrated aqueous film forming
  foam (AFFF), while creating the least amount of potentially harmful
  byproducts.


  PFAS are a group of synthetic chemicals that have been widely used for more than 60 years to make plastics, firefighting foams, and lubricants, and to help make products stain-resistant, waterproof, and nonstick. Addressing and managing PFAS in the environment is one of the most pressing issues facing EPA and its partners. This issue is particularly challenging because PFAS chemicals have a very strong carbon-fluorine chemical bond that leads to persistence in the environment and makes their complete destruction extremely difficult. Given the ubiquitous nature of PFAS and increasing public concerns, EPA and its partners are looking for greater certainty when making decisions about disposal and treatment of PFAS containing materials and PFAS contaminated media/waste.


  PFAS compounds are found at different concentrations in various waste streams including aqueous film forming foam (AFFF), biosolids, ground water, sludge and soil. Of those, unspent AFFF is among the most highly concentrated waste streams and the focus of this challenge. Currently, EPA is investigating all methods of destroying PFAS, including incineration, and a number of developing technologies. The goal of this challenge is to discover new non-incineration technologies and approaches that remove at least 99 percent of PFAS in unspent AFFF while preventing the creation of harmful byproducts.

  #### Total Cash Prize Pool


  The total cash prize pool is $50,000.


  #### Prize Breakdown


  The Seeker may award a total prize award pool of $50,000. The minimum full award amount is $30,000. The Seeker can allocate higher individual award amounts, as deemed appropriate. The Challenge award will be contingent upon results of critical analysis and evaluation by the Seeker. Meeting the Technical Requirements does not guarantee that the proposed solution will receive an award from the Seeker. Partial cash prizes may be considered for solutions that meet some, but not all, of the criteria.


  Winning Solver(s) may be invited to reduce their solution to practice. Solvers should make it clear if they have the interest and ability for subsequent development phases and would be willing to consider future collaborations and/or subsequent competitions with support of government staff and facilities.
rules: >-
  * Winning Solvers must certify they do not have identical or essentially
  equivalent work currently funded by a Federal agency.

  * Federal employees acting within the scope of their employment should consult his or her ethics official before participating in the Challenge.

  * Solvers are not required to give up any of their intellectual property (IP) rights to the EPA or its partners to be eligible to receive an award.

  * Submissions to this Challenge must be received by 11:59 PM (US Eastern Time) on August 25, 2020.  Late submissions will not be considered.


  #### Terms and Conditions


  * Solvers will not receive compensation for resources or time invested in addressing the Challenge. Only the winning solution(s) will receive a cash award.

  * Only the top-ranked solution will receive the award unless other solutions have similar equity as judged.

  * Solvers retain their rights to all intellectual property (e.g., details and design of their technology) that may be disclosed to the sponsors over the course of the Challenge. Technical details and designs will not be disclosed or published without permission from the technical point of contact named in the registration.

  * Sponsors retain the right to disclose reference sample data, performance criteria, and other evaluation criteria summarized in the technology description to provide a transparent reporting of how the winning solution was selected.

  * Sponsors retain the right to publish, present, and/or otherwise publicize results of the Challenge that does not involve the disclosure of intellectual property of the Solver(s). Solvers will be afforded to review publications, presentation, or other publicity in order to protect against unwanted disclosure of intellectual property. 

  * Solvers reserve the right to remove themselves from the competition at any time, up to final submission of results for evaluation, by notifying the sponsor in writing. The technical point of contact must make the request in writing on behalf of his/her team.

  * Registration for the Challenge does not confer any obligation to deliver results. However, any Solvers removing themselves from the competition prior to evaluation forfeit the rights to publish results obtained for the reference samples supplied for the competition without written consent from the Challenge sponsors.

  * Solvers that do not submit their results and technology description by the submission deadline will be automatically removed from the competition and subject to the same terms as if they had forfeited in writing. The submission deadline may be extended at the discretion of the sponsors, but any extension will apply to all registered Solvers.

  #### Judging Panel


  The judging panel may be composed of federal and/or non-federal scientists, engineers, and other technical experts, including subject matter experts from the listed partners for this Challenge. All persons or entities that submit a proposal will receive a high-level evaluation and be notified as to the status of their submission. Decisions by EPA and its Partners cannot be contested.


  #### Judging Criteria


  Submissions will be judged by how they address the judging criteria listed below.


  #### This challenge is intended to encourage the development of new approaches, technologies, or technology combinations that meet the following objectives:


  1. Must be applicable for use on unspent aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) from unused AFFF concentrates containing 3 percent and/or 6 percent PFAS;

  2. Must destroy at least 99 percent of the PFAS in unused AFFF concentrates, included PFAS byproducts that may form by volatilization, particulates, and leaching from effluents;

  3. Must demonstrate scalability and cost effectiveness for a defined quantity over thermal methods used to treat AFFF.


  Solvers are not required to give up any of their intellectual property rights to EPA and its partners to be eligible to receive an award.


  **Additional features that are desired (but not required) of submitted PFAS destruction technologies/approaches:**


  * Demonstrates compatibility with current production and destruction practices;

  * Avoids creating other toxic residues after destruction of PFAS, including hazardous chemicals identified in EPA’s ToxCast database, <https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists/EPAPFASINV>; 

  * Is currently accessible in the marketplace or near market ready.


  **The ideal technology would:**


  * Perform onsite destruction of at least 99 percent of PFAS in AFFF formulations; 

  * Be currently on the market or near market;

  * Destroy parent PFAS compounds;

  * Destroy short-chain PFAS byproducts (e.g., CF4) if volatilization occurs;

  * Destroy or neutralize any unwanted byproducts (e.g., HF) that would need to be incinerated or landfilled in a hazardous waste facility;

  * Be more cost effective than thermal destruction; 

  * Have good environmental and public health outcomes (e.g., does not transfer PFAS or any unwanted byproducts into other media);

  * Be potentially applicable to other PFAS waste streams (e.g., biosolids, contaminated ground water, etc).
