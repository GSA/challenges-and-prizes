description: >-
  Over 1.5 million Americans are prescribed supplemental oxygen for use outside
  the hospital for a range of medical conditions. Although there are different
  options available for how outpatients receive supplemental oxygen, the issues
  associated with the therapeutic goals and optimal use of home oxygen continue
  to be considered and are not considered solved. Patients consistently express
  concerns around the following issues particularly: having an oxygen supply be
  lighter and more portable, making it last longer, and ensuring that they get
  the amount (“flow rate”) that is needed.  


  To address these issues, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is sponsoring the Air You Wear Challenge - a two phase challenge with a total prize purse of $500,000 to help teams with compelling ideas to develop and demonstrate proof of concept for their innovative approaches for providing supplemental oxygen to outpatients, while promoting activity in the field and awareness of this problem to the wider community. The NHLBI is interested in providing more supplemental oxygen options to outpatients. Proposed approaches can be for new devices, modifications to existing technologies, or something else entirely.  


  The goal of this challenge is to broadly stimulate research and development of processes and technologies that actively address the different outpatient issues associated with use of supplemental oxygen. People who use supplemental oxygen and their loved ones are anxious for new options that are lighter, more portable, longer-lasting, and capable of providing the required oxygen level (flow-rate). If you have actionable ideas for how to improve the portability, flow rate, or duration of home oxygen supplies, the NHLBI wants to hear about them.

    * Is this something that will cost about the same as existing solutions?
    * What are potential barriers to its widespread adoption?
* Impact (formatted text, 6000 characters max)

  * Please discuss the potential impact of your proposed approach:

    * How will it address one or more of the major patient concerns regarding supplemental oxygen? (lightweight/portable, lasts longer, and delivers the needed flow rate)
    * Is there potential for this approach to be used in other related or adjacent applications?
* Innovation (formatted text, 3000 characters max)

* Project Plan (formatted text, 4500 characters max)

  * Please provide a complete project plan, timeline, and supporting budget. If you are a Phase 1 winner, you will be expected to execute against your project plan. Be sure to address:

    * How you will be able to make a demonstrable prototype within the 30 week development period
    * What are the major milestones and what will be the biggest hurdle in successfully developing and demonstrating your technology.  How are you planning to address this hurdle?
    * The resources and expertise that you will need to successfully develop your proposed approach.  If there are resources and/or expertise needed that are currently not available to your team, how do you plan to address these gaps?
* Supplemental Information (Upload files)

  * Please upload any supporting files, such as design files, team bios or CV’s, etc.

***Phase 2 Submission Form***

* Overview (formatted text, 2000 characters max)

  * Please provide an overview of Phase 2 development work:

    * What are the key findings/results?
    * How did your results meet your expectations?
    * What are your next steps?
* Performance (formatted text, 9000 characters max)

  * Please discuss in detail how your technology works. Also, please share how your approach performed in terms of:

    * Oxygen delivery
    * Weight and portability
    * Duration of use
    * Flexibility for different patient needs
* Usability (formatted text, 6000 characters max)

  * Please discuss the advantages your technology offers to patients. Are there potential barriers to widespread adoption by patients?
* Commercial Potential (formatted text, 3000 characters max)

  * Discuss your technology’s potential for commercial success. What do you foresee as possible hurdles to commercial development? Are there other applications where this technology might be used?
* Next Steps (formatted text, 3000 characters max)

* Creativity (formatted text, 2000 characters max)

  * Looking at your developed solution and the development process to arrive at this point, please discuss how your solution and process demonstrate creativity by addressing at least the following points:

    * How is your technology different from existing supplemental oxygen options?
    * Why will users view this as an attractive and new option?
    * If you ran into any unexpected development problems, do you believe you overcame them in unusual or innovative ways?
* Video 1 (link)

  * Please provide the link to a video that shows your technology in action. Be sure to show both set-up and operation steps.  
* Video 2 (link, optional) 

  * This second video is optional. Please provide a link to a 30-90 second video that is suitable for general public viewing.
