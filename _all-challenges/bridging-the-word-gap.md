  Requirements   </p><p> <strong>The Challenge has three phases.</strong>  </p><p>  <em>Phase
  One – Design </em>    The first stage of the prize competition aims to attract
  a large set of ideas and innovators. The target product of the first stage will
  be the conceptualization of the most promising innovations to help support parental
  and caregiver behavior change around the early language environment. The submissions
  should aim to demonstrate that the proposed intervention will be accessible
  across diverse backgrounds and easily implemented by users.    The Phase 1 Submission
  shall include:    A comprehensive description of the proposed intervention in
  5 pages or less, including:  <ul>   <li>A one-paragraph executive summary that
  clearly states the question to be solved;</li>   <li>Background information
  linking the evidence to support the intervention;</li>   <li>A descriptive analysis
  of how the applicant arrived at their idea;</li>   <li>Descriptions of the methods
  and technologies involved in implementation of the intervention; and</li>   <li>An
  assessment describing the applicant’s ability to execute the proposed solution
  in Phase 2 and 3.</li>  </ul> </p><p> <em>Phase Two – Development and Small Scale Testing</em>    The
  winners of Phase One of the prize competition will then advance to a second
  stage focused on prototyping the intervention, and testing of the effectiveness
  of the intervention. Using support from the Phase One prize, intervention developers
  will test the efficacy of their models, to show that the proposed intervention
  demonstrates an impact on the outcomes of interest for children and families.
  The applicants should demonstrate both the evidence base for the intervention
  and its usability. Mentors will be made available to help solvers design appropriate
  testing methodologies and learn more about the evidence base.   </p><p> <em>Phase Three
  – Scaling</em>    The final phase of the Word Gap Incentive Prize will involve
  testing the most promising models at greater scale through rollout at the program
  or community level. This will test the scalability of the device at low-cost,
  the feasibility of implementation, and the impact on the intended outcomes.
  Applicants will be assisted in matching their submission with a community or
  program.</p>'

description: '<p>HRSA''s Maternal & Child Health Bureau is sponsoring the Word Gap Challenge
  to spur innovative solutions to promote the early language environment and address
  the "word gap," the large difference in exposure to language for children from low-income
  families as compared to children from higher-income families. This challenge will
  reward the development and testing of scalable innovations that drive behavior change
  among parents and caregivers.</p><p>The goal of the challenge is to develop a low-cost,
  scalable technologically-based intervention that drives parents and caregivers to
  talk- and engage in more back-and-forth interactionswith their young children
  (ages 0-4).</p><p>This Challenge, structured in three phases, will reach a diverse
  population of innovators and solvers, including coders, public health experts, individuals
  affiliated with academic institutions, research and development communities in the
  private sector, and others.</p><p>All submissions will be evaluated; separate prizes
  will be awarded for each of the three phases below.</p><p>Phase 1: Design    Phase<br>
  2: Development and Small Scale Testing<br>    Phase 3: Scaling</p>'
