description: "<p><span lang=\"EN\">The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with
  the Department of Energy&rsquo;s Water Power Technologies Office, U.S. Geological
  Survey, NOAA Fisheries, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
  State of Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, and Pacific Northwest National
  Laboratory, are seeking innovative methods for excluding fish from water diversions
  and intakes. While effective fish exclusion for some fish species and life history
  stages can be achieved, improvements are needed to increase effectiveness and decrease
  the costs associated with fish exclusion devices.&nbsp; Proposed solutions can include
  new ideas for addressing fish exclusion or improvements to existing technologies.
  Solutions can be applied to river and canal diversions, unscreened diversion pipes,
  or intakes at dams.&nbsp; The prize purse for this challenge is $75,000.</span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">Fish exclusion is a way of preventing movement of fish into a water
  diversion or intake. Without a fish exclusion device or method, fish can be entrained
  into the diversion or intake which means that they are removed from their natural
  environment. This can result in the loss of native fishes and reduced operating
  capabilities of the involved infrastructure. Opportunities to reduce entrainment
  at diversions and intakes will promote more sustainable and reliable water resource
  systems that can provide greater benefits for aquatic species and the public. While
  effective fish exclusion for some fish species and life history stages can be achieved,
  improvements are needed to increase fish protection efficiencies, target a wider
  range of fish species and sizes, and reduce construction, operation, and maintenance
  costs compared to conventional fish exclusion methods.&nbsp; <br /><br />Proposed
  solutions can include new ideas for addressing fish exclusion or improvements to
  existing technologies. Solutions can be applied to river and canal diversions, unscreened
  diversion pipes, or intakes at dams (e.g. turbine intakes or water regulation).
  Submissions that address fish exclusion for one or more species of concern in the
  United States (e.g. salmon, steelhead, sturgeon [green, pallid, shovelnose] and
  paddlefish, eel, lamprey [Pacific, brook, and river], Delta smelt, shad, suckers,
  river herring [alewife, blueback herring], bull trout) will be accepted.</span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">A brief video describing this Challenge can be found <a href=\"https://www.usbr.gov/research/challenges/fishexclusion.html\">here</a>.<br
  /><!--[endif]--></span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Challenge Is set to launch Wednesday,
  March 6, 2019, 12:00 pm ET.&nbsp; Submissions will be accepted until 11:59 PM ET
  on May 6, 2019.&nbsp; Late submissions will not be accepted.</span></p>"
