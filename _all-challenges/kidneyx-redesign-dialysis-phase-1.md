rules: "<p>This prize competition will be run in two phases; participants may
  submit a solution in Phase 2 even if they did not participate in Phase 1. Phase
  1 is a design phase that asks participants to submit their ideas and solutions
  related to renal replacement therapy. Up to 15 Phase 1 winners will be selected,
  with each eligible Phase 1 winning submission receiving a $75,000 cash prize.
  Winners may also be invited to present their ideas at an open public meeting
  with an audience expected to include stakeholders from across government, investors,
  patients, industry representatives, academics, and non-profit organizations.
  Eligibility rules are described in \"Terms and Conditions.\"&nbsp;<em><strong>Participants
  do not have to submit a Phase 1 entry in order to submit a Phase 2 entry.</strong></em></p>\r\n<h4>Phase
  1: Design</h4>\r\n<p>Phase 1 participants should ensure that their submission
  provides sufficient detail and information to allow judges to evaluate the submission
  in accordance with the following Phase 1 evaluation criteria:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Potential
  to significantly improve or add to the landscape of solutions to manage kidney
  failure\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Clearly demonstrates a vision for medical product development,
  which should include a clear articulation of the problem being addressed/solved.</li>\r\n<li>Clearly
  demonstrates that the proposed design includes new components, technologies,
  or approaches that have not previously been part of renal replacement therapies</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Nature
  and extent of anticipated benefit(s) to patients,\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Clearly demonstrates

  rigor)\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Clear descriptions of technological or scientific needs,
  if any, for potential development of a prototype (e.g., what gaps in the proposed
  solution exist, how might your design fit with existing approaches to create
  a solution, where do you need additional input?), to better inform and position
  HHS and ASN to offer assistance if appropriate</li>\r\n<li>Clear explanation
  of additional challenges or potential pitfalls that need to be considered or
  addressed</li>\r\n<li>Feasibility of development milestones over one year</li>\r\n<li>Feasibility

  of the knowledge or expertise the participant/participant team brings to the
  development of the proposed solution.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Quality
  of evidence supporting the design</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4>Phase Two: Prototype
  Demonstration&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p>Phase 2 of the prize competition asks participants
  to build their proposed solution into a prototype. <em><strong>Participants
  may also submit a prototype solution in Phase 2 even if they have not submitted
  a design solution in Phase 1.</strong> </em>At the end of Phase 2, judges will
  review submissions and an authorized official will select up to 3 winners, with
  each eligible winning submission receiving a cash prize of $500,000. Eligibility
  rules are described in \"Terms and Conditions.\"</p>\r\n<p>Phase 2 participants

  Phase 2 evaluation criteria:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Demonstration of at least the
  first iteration of a prototype solution whose function addresses one or more
  elements of the prize competition scope described in Section D, above (testing
  in animals or humans is not required, but some demonstration or documentation
  of the prototype&rsquo;s operating capacity is necessary).</li>\r\n<li>Demonstration
  of patient input in the design of the prototype.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Degree to which
  input from patients has informed the development of the prototype</li>\r\n<li>Estimated

description: "<p>For complete, detailed information about KidneyX and the Redesign
  Dialysis prize, check out <a href=\"http://www.kidneyx.org/\" target=\"_blank\"
  rel=\"noopener\">KidneyX.org</a> and the official <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/idealab/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/KidneyX-Redesign-Dialysis.pdf\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Redesign Dialysis prize announcement</a>.&nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The
  Kidney Innovation Accelerator (KidneyX) is a partnership between the U.S. Department
  of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the American Society of Nephrology (ASN).
  HHS and ASN plan to hold a series of KidneyX prize competitions to develop innovative
  solutions that can prevent, diagnose, and/or treat kidney diseases. Every KidneyX
  prize competition will define a problem, without a pre-conceived notion of what
  the solution(s) should be, and ask participants to find solutions. Think better,
  think bold, think big.</p>\r\n<p>The initial KidneyX prize competition is \"KidneyX:
  Redesign Dialysis,\" which has two phases. Phase 1 (submissions open now) asks participants
  to design potential solutions or components of solutions, while Phase 2 asks for
  the demonstration of a prototype solution or component. Both phases will be open
  to all eligible participants.&nbsp;<strong>Participants do not have to submit a
  Phase 1 entry in order to submit a Phase 2 entry.</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Redesign
  Dialysis prize seeks solutions or components of solutions that offer patients significant
  alternatives to dialysis as it is generally practiced today. The competition is
  intended to attract a wide range of ideas and participants and thus to catalyze
  development of new, improved classes of renal replacement therapeutic options. Of
  particular interest is applying advanced technologies currently used in non-kidney
  areas to current or potential renal replacement therapy technologies. We seek ideas
  and participants from outside the field of kidney health as well as from within
  it. Many potential prize competition participants may have applicable technologies,
  concepts, or expertise from domains that have not previously been considered in
  improving renal replacement therapy. Similarly, there may be innovators working
  on component technologies or discrete concepts that may have utility as one part
  of a novel renal replacement therapy solution.</p>\r\n<p>We're looking for solutions
  that can replicate normal kidney functions and improve quality of life. Solutions
  must address at least one of the following areas (additional details about current
  technical and scientific needs can be found in <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/idealab/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/KidneyX-Redesign-Dialysis.pdf\"
