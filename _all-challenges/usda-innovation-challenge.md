description: <h4>Help build a sustainable US food system by putting USDA data into
  the hands of farmers, researchers, and consumers.</h4>  <p>Being a farmer in America
  is not for the weak of heart. For decades, it has been a game of both chance and
  experience - making farming a difficult industry to enter. In fact, the number of
  entry-level farmers has fallen by 30% since 1987 (<a href="http://www.cfra.org/resources/beginning_farmer">http://www.cfra.org</a>).</p><p>For
  those that do enter this industry, farming is becoming an increasingly data and
  technology driven activity. Known as “precision farming” or “precision ag,” farmers
  are now utilizing data from satellites, market reports, weather forecasts, surveys,
  and sensors that provide on-demand GPS monitoring and mapping tools. (<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2012/12/02/high-tech-farming/1741071/">http://www.usatoday.com</a>)</p><p>Still,
  it’s not enough. American farmers need more data in order to create a sustainable
  food system for the United States. They need to analyse the food supply coming from
  farms and ranches and the economics of consumer demand. They need to know how yields
  have changed over time so they can prepare for and predict future crops. They need
  to know what is growing well in their area and what isn’t. Similarly, consumers
  and researchers want to know where their food is coming from and how we can make
  US agriculture more sustainable.</p><p>The USDA has a tremendous amount of food supply,
  economic demand, and remote sensing data as part of its Agricultural Statistical
  Service (NASS) and Economic Research Service (ERS), the challenge is to explore
  how to make this data accessible and provide insights for potential users.    Help
  create a sustainable, competitive, and healthy US food system. Use USDA data to
  create working, interactive applications to get farmers the information they need
  – <em>and help feed America.</em></p>
