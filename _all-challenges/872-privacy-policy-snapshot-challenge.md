    <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong>&nbsp;The Privacy Policy Snapshot Challenge is a call for designers, developers, and health data privacy experts to create an online Model Privacy Notice (MPN) generator. The MPN is a voluntary, openly available resource designed to help health technology developers who collect digital health data clearly convey information about their privacy and security policies to their users. Similar to a nutrition facts label, the MPN provides a snapshot of a product&rsquo;s existing privacy practices, encouraging transparency and helping consumers make informed choices when selecting products. The MPN does not mandate specific policies or substitute for more comprehensive or detailed privacy policies.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/privacysnapshotinfowebinar">Watch the recording</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2jYWok1">download the slides</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;the informational and Q&amp;A webinar on Thursday, January 12</strong></p>
    <p>In 2011, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) collaborated with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and released a Model Privacy Notice focused on personal health records (PHRs), which were the emerging technology at the time (<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/model-privacy-notice-mpn#2011phr">view&nbsp;2011 PHR MPN</a>). The project&rsquo;s goals were to increase consumers&rsquo; awareness of companies&rsquo; PHR data practices and empower consumers by providing them with an easy way to compare the data practices of two or more PHR companies. In the last five years, the health information technology market has changed significantly and there is now a larger variety of products such as mobile applications and wearable devices that collect digital health data.</p>
    <p>ONC recognized a need to update the MPN to make it applicable to a broad range of consumer health technologies beyond PHRs. More and more individuals are obtaining access to their electronic health information and using consumer health technology to manage this information. As retail products that collect digital health data directly from consumers are used, such as exercise trackers, it is increasingly important for consumers to be aware of companies&rsquo; privacy and security policies and information sharing practices. Health technology developers can use the MPN to easily enter their information practices and produce a notice to allow consumers to quickly learn and understand privacy policies, compare company policies, and make informed decisions. Many consumer health technologies are offered by organizations that are not subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy and security standards. This is detailed in the HHS report,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/non-covered_entities_report_june_17_2016.pdf">Examining Oversight of the Privacy &amp; Security of Health Data Collected by Entities Not Regulated by HIPAA</a>, released in July 2016 by ONC&rsquo;s Office of the Chief Privacy Officer with the cooperation of the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the FTC.</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;Privacy Policy Snapshot Challenge&nbsp;leverages updated content developed recently by ONC, with feedback from OCR, FTC, and other private and public stakeholders. The content also underwent informal consumer testing. The Privacy Policy Snapshot Challenge provides an award to the creators of the best MPN generator that produces a customizable MPN for health technology developers. The Challenge is a call for designers, developers, and health data privacy experts to create an online MPN generator that is easy for health technology developers to use in customizing a privacy notice that is compelling and understandable to consumers. Submissions will provide the code for an open source, web-based tool that allows health technology developers who collect digital health data to generate a customized privacy notice. The MPN generator must be able to produce privacy notices that adhere to the MPN content yet provide for customization by a health technology developer.&nbsp;Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2016_model_privacy_notice.pdf">https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2016_model_privacy_notice.pdf</a>&nbsp;to download the MPN.&nbsp;You can find more information about the development of the 2016 MPN&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/model-privacy-notice-mpn">ONC's MPN page</a>.</p>
    <p>The code for the web-based generator must be posted to GitHub and be available through the open source&nbsp;<a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT License 1.0</a>&nbsp;such that any app developer can implement and use it. The solution should be developed as an HTML webpage styled using CSS (or SASS)&nbsp;that is powered by a framework, library, or plugin developed in JavaScript that is packaged and made available as one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>JQuery Plugin</li>
    <li>Node.JS Module</li>
    <li>Standalone Script</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The final output of a successful submission is an MPN generator that can create customized privacy notices that would be accessible from an app or other consumer health technology; the privacy notices must, following the MPN, inform and educate the app or technology user so that they understand how the app or technology uses their personal health data. What the privacy notices created by the MPN generator look like and how they educate the user is up to the submitter &ndash; for example, the notices can be interactive or use graphics and images; however, it cannot be a simple static document such as a pdf. The MPN generator should create privacy notices that factor in accessibility, clean web design, and the differences between reading and understanding content on paper versus online, for which resources like&nbsp;<a href="https://health.gov/healthliteracyonline/">Health Literacy Online</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://standards.usa.gov/getting-started/">Draft U.S. Web Design Standards</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usability.gov/">Usability.gov&nbsp;</a>can be helpful. Submitters are also required to undertake consumer testing of the final customizable MPN produced by the MPN generator, which is intended to help bring in direct user feedback. Testing can be formal (such as standardized assessments or focus groups) or informal (such as among family members or individuals in a waiting room).</p>
    <p>Submitters must provide evidence of testing with at least five people. A larger amount of time spent with each tester, greater formal rigor, and the number and diversity of people used for testing will result in a more positive assessment under the selection criteria. Evidence demonstrating consumer testing could include sample feedback, quotes, or pictures, and should include how it affected development of the language, design, and/or structure of the customizable MPN. Resources like&nbsp;<a href="https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/">https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/</a>&nbsp;can help.</p>
prizes: <p><strong>First Place - R. Jason Cronk and Professor Daniel J. Solove</strong></p>
    <p>$20,000.00</p>
    <p>Jason Cronk and Professor Daniel J. Solove&rsquo;s generator (https://github.com/privacymaverick/mpn-generator) features a side-by-side, live-updating view allowing application developers to see the MPN as they complete the app&rsquo;s sections. It also clearly shows the developer which sections are completed or require more information. The MPN most successfully combines the clarity and simplicity of a nutrition facts-type label with visual icons that aid comprehension of the privacy concepts. Cronk and Solove best specified which terms and language were changed to enhance consumer understanding.</p>
    <p><strong>Second Place - 1upHealth</strong></p>
    <p>$10,000.00</p>
    <p>1upHealth&rsquo;s team (https://github.com/rickysahu/mpngen) uses a side-by-side view that includes live checking of entered information to verify websites and phone number formats. The generated MPN allows for extensive customization, available in HTML, JSON, and Markdown formats. Detailed interviews and usability testing were held to receive consumer feedback.</p>
    <p><strong>Third Place - MadeClear.io</strong></p>
    <p>$5,000.00</p>
    <p>MadeClear.io&rsquo;s generator (https://github.com/ajveach/MadeClear) features expandable headers allowing developers to easily see how far they have progressed in completing the MPN. The MPN uses alternating background images that help differentiate the sections and colorful icons that add context to the privacy language. The team&rsquo;s consumer testing included surveys completed by 30 individuals.</p>
