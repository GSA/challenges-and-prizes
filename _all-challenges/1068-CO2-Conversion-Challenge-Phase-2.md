description: <p>The Challenge seeks to develop novel synthesis technologies that
  use carbon dioxide (CO2) as the sole carbon source to generate molecules that
  can be used to manufacture a variety of products, including substrates for use
  in microbial bioreactors. Because CO2 is readily abundant within the Martian
  atmosphere, such technologies will translate into in-situ manufacturing of
  products to enable humans to live and thrive on the planet, and also be
  implemented on Earth by using both waste and atmospheric CO2 as a
  resource.</p> <p>Competitors are required to build, demonstrate and produce a
