  Major Christopher S. Kepner, the 11th Command Sergeant Major of the Army National
  Guard, is requesting design ideas for his new challenge coin. He believes his coin
  should be a reflection of the entire enlisted corps and Soldiers have the best ideas
  on how this coin should look. Members of the Army National Guard in the grades of
  E1 through E6 may submit their challenge coin design for CSM Kepner’s considerations.</span>    Learn
