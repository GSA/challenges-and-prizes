  (such as third party content or open source code), You must provide the Competition
  Sponsor with all appropriate licenses and releases for such third party works.
  In the event You cannot provide all such required licenses and releases, the
  Competition Sponsor reserves the right, in the Competition Sponsor''s sole discretion,
  to disqualify the applicable Entry.</li>  </ol>  <strong>7.5</strong>     You
  may participate by registering, but You may not register more than one true
  and uniform identity; multiple registrations for a participant using multiple
  identities are not allowed. NASA and/or RAMPIT reserve the right to disqualify
  any Entry made by a participant violating this limitation, regardless of whether
  all of the respective parties had knowledge of such violation. You may only
  submit one Entry.    <strong>7.6</strong>      The application requirements
  for your Entry are clearly described on this website. Your Entry will be assessed
  initially by five reviewers, who will be assigned to score your Entry either
  randomly or after considering any potential conflicts of interest, using the
  scoring rubric and any other judging criteria that are also described on this
  website. In cases where a Judge indicates any potential conflict of interest,
  the Entry will be assigned to another Judge. Those Judges, each of whom is named
  on this website, will be responsible for scoring your Entry. The Selection Committee
  judges are permitted to communicate with Participants solely for the purposes
  of carrying out due diligence for evaluating your Entry and assigning a score
  during the review process, but those Judges are not required to contact directly
  any individual. The judging criteria are to be applied in the sole discretion
  of the Judges. By participating in the Earth &amp; Space Air Prize, You acknowledge
  and agree to be bound by the final decision of the Judges.    <strong>7.7</strong> 
      Once a rank order of Entries has been calculated, the top three Competitors
  will be named as Finalists. Finalists will be asked to attend a one-week demonstration
  period, currently scheduled for the week of October 2, 2018, where they will
  present and test their prototype. Finalists may be asked to prepare additional
  materials in advance or upon the date of the event or shortly thereafter. You
  will be required to respond to any invitations to attend any events as promptly
  and as clearly as possible. If a Finalist is unable to attend the demonstration,
  then they may forfeit their award, and the next Competitor in the rank order
  of Entries may be named a Finalist in their place.    <strong>7.8</strong> 
     The Selection Committee will be present during the demonstration period to
  review and discuss the Finalists’ prototypes and will determine the Winner using
  judging criteria that may not incorporate the same scoring rubric employed by
  the previous assessment.    <strong>7.9</strong>      While RAMPIT, LLC (“RAMPIT”)
  is providing an online platform for your participation, RAMPIT is not responsible
  for the payment of any Award(s). Payment of any Award(s) is the sole responsibility
  of NASA and its designees, and under the Terms each participant has agreed to

  congestion on the Internet or any website, human errors of any kind, or any
  combination thereof, including any injury or damage to competitors’ or any other
  persons’ computers related to or resulting from participation, uploading or
  downloading of any materials related to this Competition. In the event of a
  dispute about the identity of any Competitor, an online registration will be
  declared as if made by the authorized account holder of the e-mail address submitted
  at time of entry.    <strong>7.11</strong>    THIS COMPETITION IS VOID WHERE
  PROHIBITED. Competitors agree that this Competition shall be subject to and
  governed by the laws of the United States of America and the forum of any dispute
  shall be in the courts of the United States of America.    <strong>7.12</strong> 
     If for any reason Competition is not capable of running as planned, due to
  infection by computer virus, bugs, worms, Trojan horses, denial of service,
  tampering, unauthorized intervention, fraud, technical failures or any other
  causes beyond the control of RAMPIT that corrupt or affect the administration,
  security, fairness, integrity, or proper conduct of this Competition, RAMPIT

  who tamper with the process, and/or to cancel, terminate, modify, or suspend
  the Competition. If NASA and/or RAMPIT terminates the Competition, it will not
  retain any rights in the submitted Entries.    <strong>7.13</strong>    The
  Competition Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify
  any Competitor who is found to be tampering with the entry process or the operation
  of the Earth &amp; Space Air Prize, to be acting in violation of these Rules,
  or to be acting in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner, or with the intent
  to disrupt or undermine the legitimate operation of the Earth &amp; Space Air
  Prize, or to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any other person.    <strong>7.14</strong> 
     Entry into the Earth &amp; Space Air Prize does not constitute entry into
  any other NASA competition, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Competition, RAMPIT
  competition, or promotion that may be offered by the Competition Sponsor and/or
  its affiliates.    <strong>7.15</strong>      NASA and/or RAMPIT reserves the
  right to disqualify any participant who violates these RULES, the Terms and
  any standards of behavior expressed or implied in them.    <strong>7.16</strong> 
       The names of the Finalists and Winner will be posted on this website for
  such period of time as the Competition Sponsor deems reasonable.    &nbsp;    &nbsp;'

description: 'NASA is launching the <a href="http://www.earthspaceairprize.org">Earth
  and Space Air Prize</a> with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)
  to develop innovative technology that can help improve air quality and health in
  space and on Earth.    Airborne particulate matter in aerosols can contribute to
  a variety of human health problems such as asthma and respiratory tract irritation.
  NASA needs small, easy-to-maintain, inexpensive aerosol sensors for missions aboard
  the International Space Station and future deep space exploration. There is a similar
  need in Earth communities for robust, versatile, easily installed, efficient and
  affordable air quality sensors. Multiple miniaturized gas sensors are currently
  available; however, instruments that measure particulate matter with appropriate
  accuracy for these applications still require some research and development.    The
  aim for this challenge is to advance the development of aerosol sensor technologies
  useful in both human space flight as well as on Earth, and for NASA to develop a
  sensor that can be flown in a future flight experiment.    <strong>TO REGISTER GO
