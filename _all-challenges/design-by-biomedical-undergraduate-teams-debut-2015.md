description: <p>NIBIB’s  DEBUT Challenge is open to teams of undergraduate students working
  on projects that develop innovative solutions to unmet health and clinical problems.
  NIBIB’s mission is to improve health by leading the development and accelerating
  the application of biomedical technologies.<p></p> The goals of the challenge are <br>1) to
  provide undergraduate students valuable experiences such as working in teams, identifying
  unmet clinical needs, and designing, building and debugging solutions for such open-ended
  problems; <br>2) to generate novel, innovative tools to improve healthcare, consistent
  with NIBIB’s purpose to support research, training, the dissemination of health
  information, and other programs with respect to biomedical imaging and engineering
  and associated technologies and modalities with biomedical applications; and <br>3)
  to highlight and acknowledge the contributions and accomplishments of undergraduate
  students.<p></p>To participate in the challenge, a team of undergraduate students must
  identify an unmet health/clinical need, and design and build a biomedical  technology/method 
  that addresses it.  Areas of interest for these design projects include, but are
  not limited to, diagnostics, therapeutics, technologies for underserved populations
  and low resource settings, point-of-care systems, precision medicine, preventive
  medicine and technologies to aid individuals with disabilities.</p>
