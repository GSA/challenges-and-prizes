description: '<p>The Department of Homeland Science Science and Technology Directorate
  (DHS S&amp;T) Research and Development Partnerships (RDP) Group Office of National
  Labs (ONL) is seeking individuals and entities with unique ideas and concepts to
  jump start the development of an innovation ecosystem focused on Bio/Agro Security.
  Innovation ecosystems typically consist of the people, institutions, policies and
  resources that promote the translation of new ideas into products, processes and
  services. This innovation ecosystem will support one of DHS’s major infrastructure
  investments: the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). </p><p>This prize competition
  seeks novel approaches to build one or more pieces of the innovation ecosystem.
  The novel approach will result in enhancement to innovation, collaboration, training,
  and talent, therefore enhancing the NBAF mission. Cash prize(s) awarded from this
  competition are intended to fund a portion of the operating budget for the idea(s)
  and associated business plan(s) that provides the best solution to build one or
  more pieces of an innovation ecosystem that aligns to the needs of the NBAF mission.</p><p>In
  2022, DHS S&amp;T will open the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in
  Manhattan, Kansas. This state-of-the-art maximum biocontainment facility will offer
  leading-edge capabilities to help protect our food supply and the nation’s public
  health.</p><p>Without a smart strategy, a laboratory can function as an island unto
  itself, unable to capitalize on the benefits of collaboration, innovation, talent
  and training that are necessary to support the mission over time. The NBAF “Think
  and Do Challenge” is an opportunity for thinkers, doers, and entrepreneurs to offer
  fresh approaches, unique ideas or proven methods to jumpstart development of an
  instrument that enhances the NBAF’s role in shaping bio/agro security for the 21<sup>st</sup>
  Century.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization, approximately 75 percent
  of new and emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic diseases which may be transmitted
  from animals to humans. The United States currently does not have a laboratory facility
  with maximum biocontainment (BSL-4) space to study high-consequence zoonotic diseases
  affecting large livestock. NBAF will be the first laboratory facility in the United
  States to provide BSL-4 laboratories capable of housing cattle and other large livestock.
  NBAF will also feature a vaccine development module to augment its laboratory research
  and accelerate the transfer of new science and technology into the marketplace.
  See <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/national-bio-and-agro-defense-facility">http://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/national-bio-and-agro-defense-facility</a>    </p><p>NBAF’s
  location in Manhattan, Kansas, places it within the Kansas City Animal Health Corridor,
  the largest concentration of animal health companies in the world. NBAF will be
  constructed and operated on a secure federally owned site on the northwest corner
  of the Kansas State University (KSU), adjacent to KSU’s Biosecurity Research Institute
  in Pat Roberts Hall. NBAF will play a leading role in protecting the nation’s health
  and food supply as part of an integrated, advanced bio/agro security innovation
  system (BASIS). This system is designed to materially enhance public/private sector
  cooperation and collaboration, leverage stakeholder knowledge and capabilities,
  accelerate the transition of technologies and products into the marketplace, and
  enable skilled training, talent development, and regional economic growth. BASIS
  is strengthened by NBAF’s proximity to a network of organizations with veterinary,
  agricultural, and animal pharmaceutical expertise.    A video presentation that
  outlines the strategic vision of the innovation ecosystem can be found at <a href="http://www.nbafchallenge.gov/">www.nbafchallenge.gov</a>.</p><p>
  The National Science Foundation has identified a number of the features of an innovation
  ecosystem. For more information see: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/ecosystem.jsp">http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/ecosystem.jsp</a>    While
  a number of the features are in place to establish an innovation ecosystem focused
  on Bio/Agro Security surrounding the NBAF, DHS S&amp;T would like to maximize the
  potential for the NBAF to serve as a focal point for the ecosystem’s components.
  Notional pieces of an innovation ecosystem include the following examples: Training
  Component: The prize competition winner would receive a cash prize to develop a
  certificate program for the training of animal care handlers in a biocontainment
  environment; Talent Component: The prize competition winner would receive a cash
  prize to develop a large animal veterinary student exchange program for exposure
  to the research in a biocontainment environment; Innovation Component: The prize
  competition winner would receive a cash prize to jump-start a business plan that
  would accelerate agricultural technologies to market; Collaboration Component: The
  prize competition winner would receive a cash prize to accelerate novel tools to
  facilitate virtual research collaboration across long distances or other barriers
  (i.e. from within biocontainment).</p><p>The concepts above are provided as illustrations.
  Solvers are encouraged to develop their own concepts or to build upon the ideas
  above. Proposed Solutions should pursue economic, scientific, educational and technical
  opportunities that will advance the development of a vital innovation ecosystem
  around NBAF, comprising elements of innovation, collaboration, talent, and training.</p>'
