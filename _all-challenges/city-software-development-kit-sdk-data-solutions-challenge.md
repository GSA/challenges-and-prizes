  <a title="City SDK" href="http://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk/" target="_blank">U.S.
  Census Bureau has developed an open data software development kit (SDK) </a>to enable
  a community, public, or private sector individuals and organizations to more easily
  extract value from Census data through user-friendly Application Program Interfaces
  (APIs).  Through the City SDK we are aiming to provide a user friendly “Toolbox”
  for civic hackers to connect local and national public data U.S. Census Bureau in
  order to bring forth innovative solutions in our communities.</p><p>The U.S. Census
  Bureau is calling all urbanists, civic hackers, government staff, developers, designers,
  community organizers, and anyone with the passion to make their city better to develop
  solutions (web, mobile applications and tool prototypes) using the City SDK platform.
  We encourage you to apply multiple open data sets to explore your city’s most pressing
  sustainability issues across economic, environmental, social, cultural, and housing
  factors.    Examples of integrated sustainability problems could be:  <ul>   <li>How
  can I help my community find green spaces for outdoor activities via Google, Bing
  maps?</li>   <li>How do I help my community better understand the impact of commercial
  economic development on affordable housing?</li>   <li>How can I help my community
  identify local sustainable job opportunities?</li>  </ul>  <strong>To learn more
