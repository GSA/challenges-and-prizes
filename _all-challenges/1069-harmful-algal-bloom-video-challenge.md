description: <p>A harmful algal bloom is an overgrowth of algae in a water body that can affect water quality and aquatic life. Some blooms can produce toxins that may also harm people, animals, and the local environment.</p>
  <p><strong>We need high school students' help!</strong> Create a video, no more than two minutes in length, that teaches people how to spot harmful algal blooms and how to be safe around them.
