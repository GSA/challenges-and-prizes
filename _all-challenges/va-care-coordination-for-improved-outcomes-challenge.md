  Sponsor and Administrator are administering the Challenge with the support of
  the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs pursuant to the American COMPETES Reauthorization
  Act (the "Act"). Subsection (j) of section 24 of the Act establishes that the
  Government is prohibited from acquiring an interest in intellectual property
  developed by a participant in a prize competition, such as the Challenge, without
  the written consent of the participant. Registered participants shall be required
  to agree to assume any and all risks and waive claims against the Federal Government
  and its related entities, except in the case of willful misconduct, for any
  injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue, or profits, whether direct,
  indirect, or consequential, arising from their participation in a competition,
  whether the injury, death, damage, or loss arises through negligence or otherwise.

  Sponsor and the individual advisors. By participating in the Challenge, each
  entrant into the Challenge acknowledges and agrees that such evaluations may
  differ from person to person and agrees to be bound by and not challenge the
  final decisions of Sponsor and the individual advisors. <p></p>   NOTICE TO WINNERS:
  Attempts to notify potential winners will be made using the contact information
  provided on the winner''s Official Entry Form. Sponsor and Administrator are
  not responsible for e-mail or other communication problems of any kind. If,
  despite reasonable efforts, a potential winner does not respond within five
  (5) days of the first notification attempt (or a shorter time as exigencies
  may require), or if the prize or prize notification is returned as unclaimed
  or undeliverable to such potential winner, such potential winner will forfeit
  his or her prize and an alternate winner may be selected. If any potential prize
  winner is found to be ineligible, or if he or she has not complied with these
  Official Rules or declines the applicable prize for any reason prior to award,
  such potential prize winner will be disqualified and an alternate winner may
  be selected. Sponsor may successively attempt to contact up to two (2) potential
  prize winners in accordance with such procedure, and if there is still no confirmed
  prize winner after such attempts have been made, if any, the applicable prize
  may go unawarded.  <p></p>  ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF ENTRANTS: Many will enter, three
  winning submissions will be selected. Actual odds of winning depend on the number
  of eligible entries received. Sponsor and Administrator cannot accurately predict

description: '<h4>Background</h4>  <p><strong>Create algorithms (methods, processes and/or
  tools) for identifying redundancies, gaps, conflicts, and interactions among care-plan
  items and other data.</strong>   <p></p> Veterans receiving health care benefits at the
  Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) interact with clinicians of multiple specialties
  and professions inside and outside VA. VA desires that each Veteran have a single
  authoritative plan of care that is shared among all treating clinicians and that
  facilitates outcomes important to the Veteran. Such a plan of care will help VA
  deliver on its triple aim of improving the Veteran’s experience, population health,
  and efficiency. VA is currently modernizing its electronic health record (EHR) systems
  to support more modern models that depend on a clear plan of care shared by all
  members of the care team. This EHR will use a range of structured data including
  natural language, template free-text, semi-structured, structured but not standardized,
  and standardized community terminologies. <p></p>VA will use LOINC for laboratory results,
  RxNorm for medications, and SNOMed for health conditions, and clinical observations.
  Other standards may also be used for occupational history and roles. In addition
  to traditional EHR data, the new EHR will allow clinicians and patients to specify
  goals of care and preferences among goals. VA will pursue acquisition of ontologies
  and knowledge bases that specify associations among interventions, observations,
  conditions, and goals. VA will also acquire clinical decision support capabilities
  to include rule and workflow services that may process algorithms in real time.
  It will also have analytical platforms optimized for cross-patient data analyses
  using statistical and other types of software for finding and characterizing associations.
  This platform will also support natural language processing.  <h4>Description</h4>  This
  challenge seeks algorithms (methods, processes and/or tools) for identifying redundancies,
  gaps, conflicts, and interactions among care-plan items and other data. The solutions
  would be part of an electronic health record used by clinicians or patients. For
  this challenge, VA is not interested in re-creating a system for interactions among
  drugs (both over the counter and prescription).  <p></p>  The solutions should focus on
  at least one of the following health concerns: mental health, chronic pain, diabetes,
  and cardiovascular disease as well as address how proposed methods would scale to
  other health concerns. The solutions should address redundancies and conflicts among
  care-plan items. VA encourages solutions to address at least one of the other issues:
  gaps, facilitating interactions, and impeding interactions. The solutions should
  address the following care plan items: medications, laboratory-test orders. Goals
  or parameters for treatment, home-health nursing care plans, inpatient nursing care
  plans, physical therapy/exercise regimens, and counseling regimens should also be
  considered. Methods should account  <h4>Timeline</h4>  <ul>   <li>Registration Opens
  : April 28, 2015</li>   <li>Phase I Deadline: July 13, 2015</li>   <li>Phase II
  Launch: August 10, 2015</li>   <li>Phase II Deadline: November 2, 2015</li>   <li>Evaluation
  Period Begins: November 6, 2015</li>   <li>Announcement of Winners: Early December</li>  </ul>  <h4>Evaluation
  Criteria</h4>  The Challenge requires a solution that identifies treatment redundancies
  and interactions encompassing multiple providers, patient behaviors and prescriptions.
  Evaluation criteria for judging will include:  <ul>   <li>Potential to resolve care
  coordination issues and integrate data from the VA as well as external sources (50%)</li>   <li>How
  well the methods scale to produce content (algorithms) for various use cases (25%)</li>   <li>Potential
  and realistic plans for adoption (15%)</li>   <li>Innovative and elegant (10%)</li>  </ul>  <h4>Submission
  Requirements</h4>  The challenge will take place in two phases. Phase I will require
  teams to submit a written description of the proposed solution, while phase II will
  require working prototypes. The submission requirements for each phase must include
  (but not limited to):    Phase I:  <ul>   <li>A written description (up to 3 pages)
  describing the algorithms (methods, processes and/or tools) to identify redundancies,
  gaps, conflicts, and interactions among care-plans, what data is necessary and how
  you would incorporate these data</li>   <li>A slide deck with illustrations of how
  the algorithms would be used (no more than 10 slides)</li>  </ul>  Phase II:  <ul>   <li>All
  of the above</li>   <li>Link to working application</li>   <li><a href="http://www.health4con.com/devchallenge/files/KeyTerms-Final.pdf">Key
