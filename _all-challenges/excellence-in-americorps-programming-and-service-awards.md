description: <p>In honor of retired US Senator Tom Harkin, an inspiring champion for
  national service, the Corporation for National and Community Service will present
  the <strong>“Excellence in AmeriCorps Programming and Service Awards.”</strong><p></p>Our
  goal for these awards is to recognize outstanding and innovative programs and high
  quality and meaningful AmeriCorps service experiences (for current members and alumni).    Just
  as Senator Harkin sought to expand “what worked” throughout his career, we want
  these awards to encourage the development and expansion of best practices in national
  service programming, improved project development, and increase the value of the
  AmeriCorps member experience to help tackle the country’s most pressing human and
  environmental needs through service.</p><p>With emphases on engaging individuals with
  disabilities in service, best program innovation and enhancements, and compelling
  AmeriCorps member experience, the awards reflect the depth of impact of the national
  service field on the communities served and the individuals serving.    These awards
  will allow us to share excellent program strategies and models with the national
  service field and the general public so that individuals, nonprofits, government
  agencies, schools, and more will be aware of the excellent and diverse range of
  national service programs across the country.</p>
