description: '<h4>THE CALL TO ACTION</h4>    <p>Aquaculture, the farming of fish and other seafood,
  has great potential to contribute to food security, nutrition, and economic growth
  for the developing world. It is currently the fastest growing animal food producing
  sector, and an increasing source of protein for human consumption. Most aquaculture
  occurs within the developing world. Despite its increasing importance, current aquaculture
  methods are neither sustainable nor scalable. The Blue Economy Challenge seeks to
  find ways to rethink aquaculture inputs, design, and products in way that meets
  human sustainability and development through long-term ecological sustainability.</p><h4>THE
  PROBLEM</h4> <p>Global demand for protein is anticipated to skyrocket in the coming decades.
  Aquaculture has the potential to produce a significant proportion of the world’s
  nutrition. While fisheries globally are nearing the point of collapse, the worldwide
  demand for protein is expected to continue to grow rapidly, especially as large
  populations in developing countries gain wealth and adopt middle-class diets higher
  in protein. Aquaculture is projected to at least double in outputs by 2050. This
  projection may be conservative, as aquaculture increasingly is a solution for offsetting
  land-based sources of protein. Aquaculture food supply per capita and total production
  value have grown at an annual rate of almost 9% for decades, and although this rate
  is around 6-6.5% today, farmed seafood has overtaken production from capture fisheries.
  Fish farming enables seafood consumption (and access to protein) to continue to
  increase even as marine fisheries production has flat-lined.</p>    <p>While the current
  aquaculture industry is a vital producer for the global fish market, supplying 58
  percent of the fish we eat, much aquaculture (particularly predatory fish and prawn)
  remains unsustainable, degrading both land and marine habitat, risking the introduction
  or spread of invasive species and pathogens, and polluting surrounding ecosystems.
  Many aquaculture farms are also economically unsustainable. Ninety percent of aquaculture
  occurs in the developing world where lack of access to current technologies and
  capital, coupled with weak regulation, are barriers to change. Moreover, aquaculture
  is often a direct response to depleted fisheries, yet the aquaculture industry relies
  heavily on wild-caught fish to feed captive fish, which could lead to overfishing
  and undermine human and environmental sustainability in the long-term.</p><p>    The opportunity
  for reengineering aquaculture in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) is great. People
  in a number of developing countries of the IOR rely on fish for over half of the
  animal protein in their diets (i.e. Bangladesh, Comoros, Indonesia, Maldives, and
  Sri Lanka) [FAO], and this will likely increase with growing populations. In 2012,
  aquaculture production in Southern and Eastern Asia (excluding China) accounted
  for 26% of world total production [FAO] and in Indonesia, fishing and fish farming
  employs nearly 6 million people [FAO]. With improvements and growth in the aquaculture
  industry, this sector could potentially improve the food security and livelihoods
  of many people in the developing economies of the IOR. Aquaculture can be the protein
  source of the future, yet as the industry currently stands, it is in need of innovations
  to improve efficiency, sustainability, and long-term viability. Accordingly, we
  are inviting you to solve three of its major challenges.</p>    <strong>The Problem</strong>    While
  helping to relieve pressure on at-risk and collapsed fisheries, aquaculture has
  its own unique sustainability challenges. The most direct concern is the feed used
  in aquaculture. It accounts for 40-70% of producton costs and puts heavy demands
  on wild fsheries, which are the primary source of current feeds. With the dramatic
  growth in the aquaculture industry, prices for fishmeal and fish oil— prime constituents
  of many aquaculture feeds—are increasing.    Fishmeal and fish oil largely come
  from harvested pelagic fish like anchovies or menhaden, which are currently sustainable
  fisheries, but these resources might be used for other beneficial purposes. Remarkably,
  for a yield of one kilo of farmed fish, particularly carnivorous fish, it can require
  inputs of up to 20 kg of wild fish. Further, some of the species harvested for fishmeal
  and oil are targeted indiscriminately and even referred to as “trash fish” when
  in actuality the catch from these trawls can include numerous fish of high value
  and ecological significance that are necessary for food security and sustainability.    By
  incentivizing the creation of replacements for wild fish in feed, aquaculture could
  become significantly more sustainable, nutritious, and profitable. Moreover, by
  reducing the price of sustainable feed it could allow smaller farmers to enter the
  market. Potential replacement solutions include generating feed from soy, seaweed,
  ethanol/biofuel waste products, algae, yeast, bacteria, and insects.    <br><strong>
  The Challenge </strong>    Create highly nutritional aquaculture feed replacements
  that matches or improves on the cost and nutritional performance of existing feedstock
  while reducing the burden on the natural environment. New feed replacements should
  eliminate or dramatically minimize their impact on wild fish stocks and and other
  environmental systems not use agricultural products used for human consumption.
  Feed replacements should have equal or greater nutritional value per dollar compared
  to commercially available fishmeal.    <br><strong>Criteria </strong>    Environmental
  Sustainability: Feed replacements should eliminate or dramatically minimise their
  impact on wild fish stocks. Feed replacements should not have any measurable increase
  in the use of antibiotics. The solutions will include clear mitigation plans for
  feed replacement that involves any potential trade offs in deforestation or excess
  demand on existing food and agriculture systems (i.e. corn, grain, etc.). Feed replacements
  must not deplete wild fishery stocks or offset other nutritional products (e.g.
  agricultural products currently used for direct human consumption). Replacement
  feed stocks for aquaculture that also can serve as substitutes for other types of
  feed will be favored.    Cost &amp; Performance Criteria: These criteria include
  improved performance on a species’ traditional feed conversion ratio, the expected
  profitability or the marginal costs and revenue for the feed replacement at scale,
  and the feasibility for scalability of the feed replacement to multiple identified
  geographies (i.e. market growth). The price point for the feed replacement should
  be US $1,500 ton/meal and US$750/ton to manufacture or lower. The feed replacement
  should have equal or greater nutritional value per dollar compared to benchmarked
  feed for protein (protein performance should be better than or as good as commercially
  available fishmeal), micronutrients, and Omega 3. As applicable, the feed replacement
  should demonstrate energy, material, and resource efficiency advantages.    Examples
  1. Replacement fish feed from micro or macro algae or other nontraditional feed
  sources that minimise the number of trophic levels.    2. Feed replacements that
  can be generated in a closed-loop system that minimize direct or indirect environmental
  damage'
