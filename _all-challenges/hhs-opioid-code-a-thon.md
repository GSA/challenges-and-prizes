description: 'Drug overdose deaths and opioid-involved deaths continue to increase
  in the United States. The majority of drug overdose deaths (more than six out of
  ten) involve a prescription or illicit opioid. Ending this epidemic is among the
  Department’s top priorities, and to combat this crisis the U.S. Department of Health
  and Human Services (HHS) has implemented a <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/index.html">five-part
  strategy</a> that provides the overarching framework for HHS’s opioid-related activities.
  To build on these efforts, HHS is looking to leverage the full potential of data
  and technology to address the opioid crisis by hosting an Opioid Code-a-Thon. Participants
  will use a variety of provided datasets related to opioids and develop a solution
  to address one of the following challenge tracks:  <ul>    <li>Opioid Treatment</li>    <li>Opioid
  Usage</li>    <li>Opioid Misuse Prevention</li>  </ul>  For full details about this
  challenge, please view the <a href="http://hhsidealab.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/102417-competes-public-notice-remediated.pdf">official
  announcement of challenge requirements and registration</a>.'
