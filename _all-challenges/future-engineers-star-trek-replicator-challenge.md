description: '  Calling
  all Starfleet cadets!    <p>Star Trek, ASME and NASA want you to pioneer the future
  of food in space. Your challenge is to create a digital model of a food-related
  item for astronauts to 3-D print in the year 2050. We want designs that boldy go
  where no human has 3-D printed before and designs that help astronauts eat nutritious
  meals so they can live long and prosper.</p>    <p>You must specify one of the following
  locations for your 3-D print: our moon, another planet, another planet’s moon, or
  a spacecraft beyond low earth orbit (explain where it is going and why). You must
  also specify the intended printing material (feedstock) for your 3-D print. This
  could be plastic, metal, recycled materials, locally sourced material, or any non-edible,
  3-D printing feedstock you think would advance human space exploration.</p>    <p>Eating
  a meal in space goes beyond the actual food itself - from growing food to devouring
  it. There are many things to consider, so check out our <u>rules</u>, <u>design
  guidelines</u>, and <u>education resources</u> prior to starting your design.    Student
  winners will receive a range of prizes, including a trip to New York for a tour
  of the Space Shuttle Enterprise at the Intrepid Museum with an astronaut, a 3-D
  printer for the winners’ schools or a <em>Star Trek</em> prize pack.    We hope
  you’re hungry for space innovation… Good Luck!</p>'
