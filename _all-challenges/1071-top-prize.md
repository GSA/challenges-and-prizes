  <h4>Key Dates:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>September 23:&nbsp; Submissions Open</li>
  <li>November 1:&nbsp; Submissions Due</li>
  <li>December:&nbsp; Prize winners announced</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p><a href="https://opportunity.census.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Opportunity Project (TOP)</a>, a program run by the Census Open Innovation Labs (COIL) at the U.S. Census Bureau, brings together government, communities, and the technology industry to create digital tools that address our nation’s greatest challenges with open data. Through 12-week sprints, TOP challenges technologists outside of government – companies, non-profits, and universities – to create digital tools with Census and other federal open data to expand American economic opportunity.</p>
  <p>TOP works with experts from the Census Bureau and other federal agencies to identify high-priority challenges facing the public, and then engages experts from the private and nonprofit sectors through technology development sprints. Each 12-week sprint results in new data-driven tools that directly serve families, local leaders, and businesses. This process helps to empower people with technology, make government data more accessible and user-friendly, and facilitate cross-sector collaboration to build new digital solutions with open data. </p>
  <p>Since launching in 2016, 30 federal agencies and over 100 external organizations including companies, universities and community organizations have worked together to create 80 new digital products for the public.  These products provide solutions to challenges including the opioid crisis, disaster response, connecting veterans with jobs, promoting STEM education, and more. </p>
  <p>TOP supports the Census Bureau’s mission and Title 13 mandate to disseminate data to the public. It is also a component of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Presidents-Management-Agenda.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President’s Management Agenda</a> — namely, <a href="https://www.performance.gov/CAP/leveragingdata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cross Agency Priority (CAP) Goal 2:&nbsp; Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset</a>, championed by Commerce Deputy Secretary Karen Dunn Kelley, which focuses on utilizing data as an asset to grow the economy, increase the effectiveness of the Federal Government, promote transparency, and make government data more useful to the public, businesses, and researchers. TOP is also a <a href="https://strategy.data.gov/proof-points/2019/04/26/helping-baltimore-volunteers-find-where-to-help/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proof Point</a> within the first ever <a href="https://strategy.data.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Data Strategy</a>.</p>
  <h4>The Problem</h4>
  <p>Over 9 sprint cycles and nearly 4 years, it has become clear that one of the greatest challenges associated with civic technology development is product sustainability and adoption – in short, what happens to these solutions after The Opportunity Project sprint process. Now, in order to help advance some of the most promising technology solutions developed through The Opportunity Project, the Census Bureau is launching a Prize Challenge to help tech teams deploy their technology solutions, ensure they reach end users and drive impact on the critical problems they aim to solve. This prize challenge is open to teams that have previously participated or are currently participating in The Opportunity Project, and built a digital product with open data through an Opportunity Project facilitated sprint or utilizing <a href="https://opportunity.census.gov/toolkit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Opportunity Project toolkit, which provides a step-by-step outline for replicating the sprint process</a>. <strong>The Census Bureau is conducting this challenge under the authority of and in accordance with the America COMPETES Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 3719.</strong></p> 
  <h4>Challenge Goals and Categories</h4> 
  <p>The Opportunity Project Prize Challenge is a new opportunity for teams who have participated in The Opportunity Project to compete for funding to expand their impact, deploy tools to end users, and begin to or continue to deliver impact on critical problems facing the public.</p>
  <p>Because the challenges tackled in The Opportunity Project to date are so broad, COIL has identified five categories that capture a range of critical problems, described below. Teams applying for the prize must submit their product in at least one category, and can submit in up to 2 categories. </p>
  <ol>
  <li><strong>2020 Census:&nbsp; Reaching Hard-to-Count Communities</strong>:&nbsp; e.g., products focusing on challenges such as increasing response rates in hard-to-count communities, bridging the digital divide, promoting online self-response through digital literacy, and promoting 2020 Census jobs;</li>
  <li><strong>Revolutionizing the Workforce:&nbsp; </strong>e.g., products focusing on challenges such as employment, training, education, supporting entrepreneurship, creating multiple pathways for careers, and developing regional talent pipelines for high growth development; </li>
  <li><strong>Building Thriving Communities:&nbsp; </strong>e.g., products focusing on challenges such as affordable housing, transportation information and infrastructure, public safety, investment in communities, and community infrastructure development;  </li>
    <li><strong>Creating Resilient People and Places:&nbsp; </strong>e.g., products focusing on challenges such as disaster preparedness and response, environmental stewardship, and local address databases to support first responders and other community needs; </li>
    <li><strong>Creating the Future of Health:&nbsp; </strong>e.g., products focusing on challenges such as the opioid crisis, connecting patients with clinical trials, public health and disease prevention, emotional wellbeing, and tick borne diseases.</li>

### Description


<h4>Key Dates:</h4>
<ul>
<li>September 23: Submissions Open</li>
<li>November 1: Submissions Due</li>
<li>December: Prize winners announced</li>
</ul>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p><a href="https://opportunity.census.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Opportunity Project (TOP)</a>, a program run by the Census Open Innovation Labs (COIL) at the U.S. Census Bureau, brings together government, communities, and the technology industry to create digital tools that address our nation’s greatest challenges with open data. Through 12-week sprints, TOP challenges technologists outside of government – companies, non-profits, and universities – to create digital tools with Census and other federal open data to expand American economic opportunity.</p>
<p>TOP works with experts from the Census Bureau and other federal agencies to identify high-priority challenges facing the public, and then engages experts from the private and nonprofit sectors through technology development sprints. Each 12-week sprint results in new data-driven tools that directly serve families, local leaders, and businesses. This process helps to empower people with technology, make government data more accessible and user-friendly, and facilitate cross-sector collaboration to build new digital solutions with open data. </p>
<p>Since launching in 2016, 30 federal agencies and over 100 external organizations including companies, universities and community organizations have worked together to create 80 new digital products for the public.  These products provide solutions to challenges including the opioid crisis, disaster response, connecting veterans with jobs, promoting STEM education, and more. </p>

<h4>The Problem</h4>
<p>Over 9 sprint cycles and nearly 4 years, it has become clear that one of the greatest challenges associated with civic technology development is product sustainability and adoption – in short, what happens to these solutions after The Opportunity Project sprint process. Now, in order to help advance some of the most promising technology solutions developed through The Opportunity Project, the Census Bureau is launching a Prize Challenge to help tech teams deploy their technology solutions, ensure they reach end users and drive impact on the critical problems they aim to solve. This prize challenge is open to teams that have previously participated or are currently participating in The Opportunity Project, and built a digital product with open data through an Opportunity Project facilitated sprint or utilizing <a href="https://opportunity.census.gov/toolkit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Opportunity Project toolkit, which provides a step-by-step outline for replicating the sprint process</a>. <strong>The Census Bureau is conducting this challenge under the authority of and in accordance with the America COMPETES Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 3719.</strong></p>

<p><strong>PART 3: Narrative</strong></p>
<p>Applicants must submit a narrative document describing the team’s build process, data used, implementation and sustainability plan, in no more than three (3) pages (minimum 11 point standard font, single spaced, 1” margins, submitted as a .docx or PDF document). This narrative is the team’s opportunity to address elements of the five judging criteria. The sections below are suggested, but the specific items within each are not intended to be exhaustive and applicants are encouraged to include other points they consider relevant to address the judging criteria, within the stated page limits. <strong>Submissions exceeding the allowed length may not be reviewed.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Product overview and functionality: </strong>Explain how the product works, what problem it was intended to solve, the target end user/audience, and an overview of the user journey. </li>
<li><strong>Design and build process: </strong>Describe the process used to design and build this product, focusing in particular on strategies employed for end user engagement and any other notable collaboration around product development or implementation, the timeline along which it was created, and where it is now in the product life cycle. As part of their process, teams should have completed user research, such as in-person interviews, focus groups, needs analysis, ethnographic research, or collation of existing research, which should be described in this section.</li> 
<li><strong>Federal open data used: </strong>Specific types of federal open data used in the product from the Census Bureau or other federal agencies, and what purpose each data set serves in the product. Applicants may also choose, but are not required to highlight what other state, local, or proprietary data they used in the product. </li>
<li><strong>Target or documented impact: </strong>Describe the target end users of this product and the problem or user need it aims to address.  What impact do you expect this product will have if it reaches the target users?  If the product is already in use, describe its utilization and impact to date.</li>
<li><strong>Product implementation and sustainability plan: </strong>Describe how the product has been or will be implemented (i.e. deployed to and used by the target end users), how the product will be maintained in the long term, and how impact will be tracked (qualitatively and quantitatively). If the product is not already live, indicate the planned time to market, and implementation timeframe. This should address the question: when can end users actually begin to use this product, if not currently? This is not intended to be a business/commercialization plan; the product can but does not necessarily need to generate revenue. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>PART 4: Collaborator letters of support</strong></p>
<p>Teams must submit at least one (1) and up to three (3) letters of support from collaborators on this project who represent user advocates and/or implementation partners.

Each signed letter should indicate how this partner collaborated or will collaborate with the applicant on the specified product, should include the collaborators’ contact information (email and/or phone), and must be <strong>no longer than one page</strong> (minimum 11 point standard font, submitted as a <strong>.docx</strong> or <strong>PDF document</strong>).</p>
  <p><strong>PART 5: (Optional) Multimedia supporting documentation </strong></p>
  <p>Teams have the option to submit an up to 4-minute video or webinar recording that demonstrates the product’s functionality. In place of a video, teams may also submit images or screenshots of the product in a PPT or PDF document of five (5) slides or fewer. <strong>Submissions exceeding the allowed length may not be reviewed. </strong></p>
