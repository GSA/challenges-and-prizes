  This is the second of three challenges the Air Force Research Laboratory
  (AFRL) is sponsoring. It is focused on the use of biotechnology to improve the
  performance of aerospace fuels. Participants will submit white papers on
  viability of the approach to bio-synthesize two molecules A and B needed for
  aerospace thermosets. In Phase Two, submitted white papers will be
  down-selected from the viable entrees. 


  The potential awardees will be given two weeks to enter into a subsequent agreement with a company that can scale up their production concept and demonstrate the capability to manufacture testable amounts with

  a U.S. company (if they cannot manufacture themselves). Semi-finalist teams will be given a one-hour time slot to pitch their concept and scale up strategy, with their manufacturing partner (if needed), to the evaluation team.
prizes: >-
  * 25% of the prize purse will be awarded to the winner of this pitch
  competition to describe a formulation for a high-energy endothermic fuel using
  novel molecules that the team identifies and to describe the biosynthetic
  approach to generate this fuel. 

  * 25% of the prize purse will be awarded to create a 500 mL sample of the biofuel to AFRL for testing. The properties of the biofuel must be determined as delineated in the “Solution Requirements” section. 

  * 25% of the prize purse will be provided to proposers if the properties of the proposed biofuels are sufficient, as determined by AFRL, to proceed to manufacture at least 4L of the biofuel and provide a cost analysis comparing the biosynthetic path to traditional methods along with a scale-up plan to generate 10,000-100,000 gallons of biofuel. 

  * 25% of the prize purse will be awarded upon delivery of the 4L of biofuel and the scale-up plan.

  In the first phase of this contest, participants will submit white papers on viability of the approach to biosynthesize a high-energy endothermic fuel. In phase 2, these white papers will be down selected to the viable entries (potential awardees). These selectees will be given 2 weeks to enter into a subsequent agreement with a US company that can scale up their production concept and demonstrate the capability to manufacture testable amounts (if they cannot manufacture it themselves). These teams will be invited to present a 1-hour pitch of their concept and scale up strategy with their manufacturing partner (if needed) to the evaluation team.
judging: Submissions will be evaluated for the viability of the approach to
  improve performance of aerospace fuels using synthetic biology and
  biotechnology.
