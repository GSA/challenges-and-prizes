### Description

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) helps power and secure America's future and ensure the country’s role as a leader in science and technology. In 2015, the Secretary of Energy authorized the formation of the Office of Technology Transitions (OTT) to be responsible for developing and overseeing delivery of DOE’s strategic vision and goals for technology commercialization and engagement with the business and industrial sectors across the United States. OTT’s mission is to expand the commercial impact and public benefit of DOE’s research and development portfolio to advance the economic, energy, and national security interests of the Nation.  

Energy startups and innovative technologies are critical to the growth of the energy economy in the United States and abroad. Startups drive technology development, business model innovation, and job creation. The private sector has had difficulty providing sufficient capital, business development services, and entrepreneurial training to early-stage, high-risk, longer-term, capital-intensive technologies, like those required for transforming the nation’s energy systems.  

Strong business incubation services—including, but not limited to, mentoring, entrepreneurial training, access to testing and prototyping assistance—not only provide direct support for early-stage startups, but also have the potential to de-risk the startups for follow-on investors. Incubators have the potential to accelerate regional economic development, strengthen national innovation capacity, and expand domestic energy-related manufacturing. By providing due diligence, screening applicant companies, assisting with prototyping, connecting entrepreneurs with manufacturers, and advising startups to prudently use their capital on vital services, incubators play a critical role in supporting startups as they transition into the market. 

The EPIC prize seeks to recognize the most novel, comprehensive, and impactful incubator plans that focus on developing strong innovation clusters, connections, and support for energy-related technology and entrepreneurial innovation. Prize competitors will develop a strategic plan to create or bolster innovation clusters through regional engagement, including engagement of other private actors—both for- and non-profit—as well as state and local entities that can provide additional resources. 
The prize seeks to address a capital gap in supporting these critical organizations by providing funds to be applied where incubators need them most. Providing capital to enable creative, forward-thinking organizations is critical to allow organizations to think more expansively about the role of incubators in the broader regional and national innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem. Further, it is DOE’s hope that this funding will enable winners of this prize to enhance their organization’s resilience and operational sustainability.

### Rules

Please go to the prize website for complete rules (guidelines): https://americanmadechallenges.org/epic/

#### Eligibility

* Private entities (for-profits and nonprofits), non-federal government entities such as states, counties, tribes, and municipalities, academic institutions, and individuals subject to the following requirements:

  * Private entities must be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States with majority domestic ownership and control. If an entity seeking to compete does not have domestic ownership and control, the DOE Office of Technology Transitions (OTT) may consider issuing a waiver of that eligibility requirement where the entity submits a compelling justification; the entity is incorporated in and maintains a primary place of business in the United States; and the entity otherwise meets the eligibility requirements,. OTT may require additional information before making a determination on the waiver request. There are no rights to appeal DOE’s decision on the waiver request. See Appendix 2 for more information on the waiver process. 
  * Academic Institutions must be based in the United States.
  * A group of individuals competing as one team may win, provided that the online account holder of the submission is a United States citizen or a permanent resident. Individuals competing as part of a team may participate if they are legally authorized to work in the United States. 
* DOE employees, employees of sponsoring organizations, members of their immediate families (i.e., spouses, children, siblings, or parents), and persons living in the same household as such persons, whether or not related, are not eligible to participate in the Prize. 
* Federal entities and federal employees, acting within the scope of their employment, are also not eligible to participate in any portion of the Prize. DOE national laboratory employees cannot compete in the Prize.
* Entities and individuals publicly banned from doing business with the U.S. government such as entities and individuals debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participating in Federal programs are not eligible to compete.

  * Entities identified on a Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Binding Operational Directives (BOD) as an entity publicly banned from doing business with the Unites States government are not eligible to compete. See https://cyber.dhs.gov/directives/; 
* This prize is expected to positively impact U.S. economic competitiveness. Participation in a foreign government talent recruitment program could conflict with this objective by resulting in unauthorized transfer of scientific and technical information to foreign government entities. Therefore, individuals participating in foreign government talent recruitment programs of foreign countries of risk (Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China) are not eligible to compete. Further, teams that include individuals participating in foreign government talent recruitment programs of foreign countries of risk are not eligible to compete.

  * In general, foreign government talent recruitment programs include any foreign-state-sponsored attempt to acquire U.S. scientific-funded research or technology through foreign government-run or funded recruitment programs that target scientists, engineers, academics, researchers, and entrepreneurs of all nationalities working or educated in the United States. These recruitment programs are often part of broader whole-of-government strategies to reduce costs associated with basic research while focusing investment on military development or dominance in emerging technology sectors. 
    Distinguishing features of a foreign government talent recruitment program include: 
    a) Compensation provided by the foreign state to the targeted individual in exchange for the individual transferring their knowledge and expertise to the foreign country. The compensation can take several forms, such as cash, research funding, honorific titles, career advancement opportunities, promised future compensation, or other types of remuneration or consideration. 
    b) Recruitment in this context refers to the foreign-state-sponsor’s active engagement in attracting the targeted individual to join the foreign-sponsored program and transfer their knowledge and expertise to the foreign state. The targeted individual may be employed and located in the United States or in the foreign state. Recruitment would not necessarily include any invitation for engagement extended by the foreign state, for example, an invitation to attend or present work at an international conference. 
    c) Many, but not all, programs aim to incentivize the targeted individual to physically relocate to the foreign state. Of particular concern are those programs that allow for continued employment at U.S. research facilities or receipt of DOE research funds while concurrently receiving compensation from the foreign state.  
* No organization may submit as the lead entity more than one entry to the prize. If an entity is the lead organization on multiple submissions, DOE will accept the most recent submission submitted before the deadline and determine other submissions ineligible.

Submissions will be reviewed for eligibility and completeness. Eligibility determinations as well as approval of any waiver requests will be at DOE’s sole discretion. The application may be deemed ineligible if a competitor does not meet the eligibility criteria or does not provide the items listed in “What to submit” section. Eligible submissions will be evaluated by expert reviewers, who may include officials from OTT or other federal agencies, and/or private sector experts.
