  Pacific Islanders (WHIAAPI) launched the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/edblogs/aapi/issue-areas/the-affordable-care-act/hey/">Healthy
  Engaged Youth (HEY!) Program,</a> encouraging young AAPI leaders to become Ambassadors
  by conducting outreach around the Affordable Care Act <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">(ACA)</a>
  within their campuses and communities.</p><p> This summer 2014, WHIAAPI is launching the
  E3! Program in order to “Educate, Engage, and Empower” young leaders to increase
  awareness and outreach around the following four issue areas: <b><a href="http://www.ed.gov/edblogs/aapi/education/">education,</a>

  to public service,</a> </b> and <b><a href="http://www.ed.gov/edblogs/aapi/immigration/">Deferred
  Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)</a>.</b>    </p><p>The mission of the WHIAAPI E3!
  Ambassador Program is to Educate, Engage, and Empower young leaders to increase
  awareness around critical issues facing the AAPI community and to highlight key
  federal programs and resources in which AAPIs may be underserved. Selected E3! Ambassadors
  are encouraged to conduct outreach within their campuses and communities – whether
  it’s setting up a table to share resources at a campus fair, facilitating a workshop
  during a conference, or even utilizing social media – with the goal of improving
  the quality of life and opportunity for young AAPIs. You can read more about these
  issue areas and questions to consider <a href="http://www.ed.gov/edblogs/aapi/e3-issue-areas/">here</a>.<br>    &nbsp; <br>  <iframe class="aligncenter" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/TltYlZcEjMI"
