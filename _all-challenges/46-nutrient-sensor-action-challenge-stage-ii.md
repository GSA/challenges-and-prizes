    <p>EPA, in collaboration with other agencies, is seeking demonstrations of the use of data and information from nutrient sensors to inform decisions and actions that address nutrient management.&nbsp; The total prize amount for this Challenge is $100,000; up to two winning teams will share the prize.&nbsp; This is Stage II of the Challenge; <strong><a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/nutrient-sensor-action-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stage I</a></strong> was a call for action plans, which was completed September 2017.</p>

    <h4>THE CHALLENGE</h4>
    <p>Excess nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in the nation&rsquo;s waters is one of the costliest and most challenging environmental problems we face.&nbsp; Over the last 50 years, the amount of nutrients entering into our waters has escalated, and is now one of the top causes of water quality impairment. Protecting human health and the environment from adverse impacts of excessive nutrients is a national priority.</p>
    <p>Many organizations and communities are interested in making use of sensors to provide improved spatial and temporal data that can help inform decisions and actions to protect and restore our nation&rsquo;s water resources.</p>
    <p>This Challenge calls for teams to design and implement an approach that utilizes nutrient sensors and resulting data to improve decisions and actions resulting in more effective nutrient management.</p>
    <hr />
    <h4>ELIGIBILITY</h4>
    <p>The Nutrient Sensor Action Challenge is open to communities, tribes, states and other organizations in the United States interested in deploying nutrient sensors to address an important nutrient-related water quality issue.</p>
    <p>Organizations should be currently engaged in water quality monitoring and have some level of experience using sensors, managing data, and communicating that information.</p>
    <p><strong>Participation in Stage I of the Challenge is not a requirement for participation in Stage II</strong>.</p>

<h4><strong><span style="color: #339966;">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</span></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is participation in Stage I a prerequisite&nbsp;for participating in Stage II?</strong>
<ul>
<li>No. Teams are invited to participate in Stage II, even if they did not participate in Stage I.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What is the Challenge? </strong>
<ul>
<li>The Nutrient Sensor Action Challenge seeks breakthroughs and innovative solutions that demonstrate how nutrient sensor information can be translated into knowledge to support decisions and actions pertaining to a nutrient-related topic or problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Which nutrients are within the scope of the Challenge?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nitrogen and Phosphorous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Who is eligible to participate?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Challenge is open to companies, organizations, and/or communities interested in deploying two or more nutrient monitoring sensors (one of which has a purchase price that does <em>not exceed $15,000</em>) to address an important nutrient-related topic or problem. Participants should be currently engaged in water quality monitoring and have some level of sophistication with water monitoring, data management, and communication. &nbsp;&nbsp;Team leads must be United States citizens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Is there any assistance in helping match organizations into teams?</strong>
<ul>
<li>There is not a formal process for assisting in team development.&nbsp; A list of past Challenge participants, including sensors development, upon request.&nbsp; Teams may post their interest and needs in the "Discussions" tab on the Challenge.gov page and the information can be shared in the Challenge newsletter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Is the focus of this Challenge non-point sources of nutrients, or can wastewater treatment plants participate as well?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The focus of the Challenge is not restricted to non-point sources.&nbsp; Wastewater treatment plants as well as other companies, organizations, and/or communities interested in address an important nutrient-related topic or problem are also encouraged to participate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How long is the Challenge open?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Data collection is open from March 1, 2018 - December 31, 2018; participants have flexibility to determine the 3-month window during which they will monitor and collect data. Data must be made available via web services by November 1<sup>st</sup>, 2018 and remain available to the Challenge Administrator until judging is complete (Spring 2019).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How should interruptions for maintenance, repairs, etc. be reported and accounted for?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Interruptions are understandably going to occur. Please describe anticipated interruptions to the best of your ability when submitting the registration form. Interruptions should also be noted in the final results package.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What are the price constraints for the sensors?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The purchase price of at least one of the sensors used should <em>not exceed $15,000</em>.&nbsp; This price constraint applies only to the sensor itself; it does not include other deployment costs such as communications, batteries, cables, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>If a sensor were to be provided to a team free of charge, how should the price of the sensor be reported?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Verification/validation that the sale price of the sensor not exceeding $15,000 should be provided.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Is there financial assistance for purchasing sensors?</strong>
<ul>
<li>There is not any financial assistance for sensor procurement.&nbsp; However, sensor manufacturers may be willing to loan sensors for the purpose of piloting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Is there a minimum/maximum requirement regarding the number of sensors? </strong>
<ul>
<li>Solvers must submit plans to deploy 2 or more sensors; one of which should have a purchase price that does <em>not exceed $15,000</em>. There is no maximum limit of sensors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Do sensors need to be acquired from U.S.-based organizations/companies?</strong>
<ul>
<li>No.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Does this program recommend or endorse a particular sensor or brand?</strong>
<ul>
<li>This Challenge does not recommend or endorse any brand of nutrient sensor.&nbsp; Information about sensors that were evaluated as part of the 2014 Nutrient Sensor Challenge can be found at <strong><a href="http://www.act-us.info/evaluations.php">http://www.act-us.info/evaluations.php</a></strong> .

<li><strong>Will judges need to have real-time access to the data?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Data needs to be made available to the Challenge Administrators by November 1, 2018.&nbsp; The Challenge requires data to be made available in interoperable way, meaning the judges can access and see the data via web services. A data 'download' will not be accepted at the end.&nbsp; Teams must set up their data system in such a way that the data will be shareable in a standard format over standard communication protocols. A goal of this challenge is to promote standard ways of sharing and formatting sensor data to encourage interoperability and sharing of water monitoring data. See Challenge language for data standards accepted by the Challenge judges.</li>
