description: '<p>“In his 2016 State of the Union Address, President Obama called upon
  the nation to harness the spirit of American innovation by identifying new ways
  to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer.”    – Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual
  Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office Michelle
  K. Lee  </p><p>  <strong>BACKGROUND </strong> <br>   Cancer is undoubtedly a disease that touches
  all our lives. Ending cancer as we know it requires the formation of new alliances.
  As President Obama noted, getting this done isn’t just going to take the best and
  brightest across the medical, research, and data communities — but millions of Americans
  owning a stake of it. By harnessing the power of patent data, and accelerating the
  process for protecting the intellectual property that lead to cancer immunotherapy
  breakthroughs, the USPTO is standing up and doing its part to help bring potentially
  life-saving treatments to patients, faster.  </p><p>  <strong style="line-height: 1.5;">THE
  CHALLENGE </strong><br>   With data released through the <a href="https://developer.uspto.gov">USPTO
  Developer Hub</a>, users are building rich visualizations of intellectual property
  data, an early indicator of meaningful innovation and research and development (R&amp;D),
  and combining this data with other state or agency data, such as census and bureau
  of labor statistics; and/or economic, and financial data. These types of visualizations
  demonstrate the power of telling complex stories that lead to impactful insights
  and ask why the data matter. </p><p>Similarly, we challenge you to create and illuminate
  new trend lines and interactive mappings of innovation with visualizations for all
  types of cancer treatments and diagnostics by combining our data with other unique
  data. Be sure to list the sources of your data sets (i.e. orange book data from
  FDA), tools and assumptions used to form your conclusion and visualizations. </p><p>Imagine
  your data visualizations will be the foundation to empower the federal government—as
  well as the medical, research, and data communities—to make more precise funding
  and policy decisions based on the commercialization lifecycle of the most promising
  treatments, while maximizing U.S. competitiveness in cancer investments.  </p><p>  Using
  analytic tools, processes and  other interoperable data sets, we are challenging
  you to develop interactive visualizations and stories that can help reveal new insights
  to guide public policy and research to achieve the goal of doubling the rate of
  progress toward a cure.  For example, you could address questions such as:    <span
  style="text-decoration: underline;">Trending</span>:  <ul>    <li>What new insights
  can be revealed by correlating R&amp;D spending/funding to breakthrough technologies?
  How would you define or cluster the broad spectrum of cancer treatments, therapies
  and/or diagnostics?</li>    <li>What would trace studies of commercially successful
  treatments from patent to product tell us? What data insights can be gleaned from
  understanding the time it takes bring patents to patients?</li>    <li>What are
  the peaks and valleys in the landscape of cancer treatment technologies?</li>  </ul>  <span
  style="text-decoration: underline;">Policy</span>:  <ul>    <li>If you were the
  Director of NIH or other agency, given what you have learned from this patent data
  and your research, how would you prioritize your cancer research budget? (FY2014
  National Cancer Institute budget was $4.932 billion).</li>    <li>Based on cluster
  mapping of cancer treatments, therapies and/or diagnostics, what policy would you
  put in place to promote certain technologies? For example, would you promote treatment
  to make cancer a livable disease verses curing?</li>    <li>Is there any measurable
  relationship between patent data, clinical trial data and time to it takes for the
  technology to be in the hands of the patient. If so, how and what catalyst for innovation
  and policy changes would you advise the VPOTUS for the Cancer Moonshot.</li>  </ul>  <p
  style="line-height: 15.0pt; background: white; vertical-align: top; margin: 0in
  0in 7.5pt 0in;"><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">RESOURCES</strong></p>  The USPTO
  has released a curated data set consisting of 269,353 patent documents (published
  patent applications and granted patents) spanning the 1976 to 2016 period.  This
  data and associated documentation explaining our methodology can be found on the
  <a href="https://developer.uspto.gov/product/cancer-moonshot-patent-data">USPTO
