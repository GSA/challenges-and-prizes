description: The NSF 2026 Idea Machine is a competition to help set the U.S. agenda
  for fundamental research in science and engineering. Participants can earn prizes
  and receive public recognition by suggesting the pressing research questions that
  need to be answered in the coming decade, the next set of "Big Ideas" for future
  investment by the National Science Foundation (NSF). It's an opportunity for researchers,
  the public and other interested stakeholders to contribute to NSF's mission to support
  basic research and enable new discoveries that drive the U.S. economy, enhance national
  security and advance knowledge to sustain the country's global leadership in science
  and engineering.
