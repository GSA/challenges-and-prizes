  The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), an institute of the
  National Institutes of Health (NIH), announces the NHLBI “Hope for Sickle Cell
  Disease Challenge” to help increase awareness about [sickle cell
  disease](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/sickle-cell-disease) and its
  associated complications. Sickle cell disease (SCD), also known as sickle cell
  anemia, is the most common genetic disorder in the United States (1). About
  100,000 Americans are thought to be living with SCD and each year another
  1,000 babies are born with it (2). 


  A specific single mutation in the gene for hemoglobin, when inherited from both parents, causes SCD. The hemoglobin in people living with SCD distorts the shape of the red blood cell into a ‘sickle’ or crescent moon shape that flows poorly through small blood vessels. This can cause problems in virtually any organ by reducing the delivery of oxygen and inflaming the surrounding tissue. The organ damage caused by SCD can result in strokes in the brain, kidney damage, or complications in other organs. SCD also causes significant pain in the affected tissues. This pain, which can begin in childhood, often escalates as people age, severely affecting the quality of life of individuals with SCD (3,4,5). SCD affects the quality of life for those living with it, and the lives of their families and caregivers. They may experience psychological stress, financial problems, medication management pressures (e.g., administering daily medications and managing pain episodes through behavior or lifestyle changes), and conflicts between job obligations and medical appointments because of the unpredictable nature of SCD and its associated complications (6).


  A lack of awareness about SCD and its associated complications among the public and affected communities (7,8) can contribute to stigmas associated with SCD, a lack of understanding of how the disease affects individuals and families, and to less than optimal care experienced by many patients (9). 


  *Please note that numbers in parentheses in the paragraphs above denote citations that can be found in the [bibliography document]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/bibliography-nhlbi-sickle-cell-challenge.pdf).* 


  The [SCD Implementation Consortium](https://scdic.rti.org/) (funded by the NHLBI) is testing new approaches to enhance care for SCD and improve health outcomes in eight geographically diverse areas, particularly for young adults. The [Cure Sickle Cell Initiative](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/cure-sickle-cell-initiative) is an NHLBI-led collaborative research effort accelerating the development of genetic therapies for SCD. And the NHLBI’s intramural researchers have developed gene therapy advances using a vector system to deliver a normal hemoglobin gene to blood-forming stem cells more efficiently. 


  The NHLBI supports these and other innovative research activities for SCD and is seeking to foster improved awareness about SCD and address the associated [myths](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/materials/infographic-5-facts.html) and stigmas by launching the [NHLBI Hope for Sickle Cell Disease Challenge](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/sickle-cell-challenge). This Challenge incentivizes college and graduate students to develop innovative Tools that build awareness of evidence-based information about SCD. Examples of such Tools include, but are not limited to, a video (documentaries, testimonials, etc.), a software application, a game (board, computer, interactive, etc.), a website, a book (children’s books, k-12 learning tools, etc.), a marketing campaign, a social media campaign, music or a song, a grassroots campaign, or an exhibit. The Tools created for this Challenge should undergo pilot testing and be evaluated using a rigorous scientific assessment. Knowledge dissemination and transfer may improve patient outcomes by (i) increasing public awareness of SCD, particularly those who have been underserved and including young adult populations and K-12 youth; (ii) providing individuals, caregivers, and families affected by SCD accurate and easily understandable information about SCD and its complications; and (iii) educating healthcare providers about pain and opioid management.


  This Challenge is open to college and graduate students to promote the field of implementation science to the next generation of researchers and offer mentoring and research training. Implementation science is the scientific study of methods and strategies that facilitate the uptake or adoption and integration of evidence-based practices, interventions, programs, policies, and research into regular use by practitioners, health systems, communities, and policymakers. The training and mentoring experiences of the Challenge will enhance SCD research knowledge for students through the creation of Tools for sickle cell disease education. The Challenge is in line with the NHLBI Center for Translation Research and Implementation Science (CTRIS) roadmaps to build capacity and increase awareness of sickle cell disease. This Challenge also encourages “team science” by providing students valuable experiences to pursue science collectively as they engage in complex problem solving to improve outcomes.

### Description

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), an institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), announces the NHLBI “Hope for Sickle Cell Disease Challenge” to help increase awareness about [sickle cell disease](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/sickle-cell-disease) and its associated complications. Sickle cell disease (SCD), also known as sickle cell anemia, is the most common genetic disorder in the United States (1).
