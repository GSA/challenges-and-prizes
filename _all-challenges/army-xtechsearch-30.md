description: "<p><span lang=\"EN\">The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition,
  Logistics and Technology (ASA(ALT)) is announcing the third cohort of the Army Expeditionary
  Technology Search &ndash; xTechSearch &ndash; to be featured at the Association
  of the United States Army (AUSA) Annual Meeting in Washington, DC, on 14 to 16 October
  2019. xTechSearch will highlight opportunities for small businesses to collaborate
  with the Army to tackle the most critical Army modernization challenges.</span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">The ASA(ALT) recognizes that the Army must enhance engagements with
  the entrepreneurial funded community, small businesses, and other non-traditional
  defense entities, by: (1) understanding the spectrum of technologies being developed
  commercially that may benefit the Army; (2) integrating the sector of non-traditional
  defense entities into the Army&rsquo;s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) ecosystem;
  and (3) providing mentorship and expertise to accelerate, mature, and transition
  technologies of interest to the Army.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The xTechSearch
  program will provide resourcing to select small businesses to demonstrate proof
  of concept for their technologies pertaining to Army challenges.&nbsp; The program
  will also integrate these small businesses into the Army&rsquo;s S&amp;T ecosystem
  by providing research opportunities with Army labs, including access to the Army&rsquo;s
  organic intellectual and technical capital.&nbsp; xTechSearch is an opportunity
  for businesses to pitch novel technology solutions &ndash; a new application for
  an existing technology or a new technology concept entirely &ndash; to the Army.&nbsp;
  The Army will provide non-dilutive seed prizes for the small businesses to demonstrate
  proof of concept in an Army-relevant challenge area.&nbsp; </span></p>\r\n<p><span
