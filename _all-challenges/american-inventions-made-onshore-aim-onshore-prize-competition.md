  of organizational affiliation.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n
  \t<li>Proposed Plan\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>The participant must provide a detailed
  description of its plan for delivering DOE’s Build4Scale training to hardware
  innovators. (Materials on build4scale.org will be provided to participants in
  an editable form. Participants are encouraged to use the materials, but are
  not limited to them. Participants may expand upon the materials themselves,
  or supplement them with other resources. The Build4Scale Terms of Use are detailed
  in Appendix B.) The plan for delivering training must include: the population
  of innovators targeted for outreach and training, as well as their geographical
  reach and region and/or organizational affiliation, if any; target number of
  innovators to train, the proposed subject areas, duration, and mechanism of
  training delivery; proposed instructors; and proposed method to capture feedback,
  document learning outcomes, and identify areas for improvement.</li>\r\n \t<li>The
  plan should also indicate proposed partners, particularly domestic manufacturers,
  that the participant will leverage to execute the plan. The application must
  indicate support from any organizations necessary to execute the proposed plan.</li>\r\n
  \t<li>The participant must clearly demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
  plan, the capability of the team to carry out the plan, and a mitigation strategy
  for any significant risk factors.</li>\r\n \t<li>The participant must specify
  how the plan’s success will be measured, including metrics and key performance
  indicators, how data pertaining to innovators will be collected before and after
  receiving training, and how the participant will ensure the proper storage and
  protection of proprietary or confidential data.</li>\r\n \t<li>The participant
  must specify a hypothesis for a sustainable revenue model that will enable activities
  to continue beyond the initial prize funding. The participant must also indicate
  how the hypothesis will be tested during the initial year. For instance, if
  the participant proposes part of its revenue stream to come from product design
  firms that benefit from educated startup clients, and another part of its revenue
  stream to come from the innovators or manufacturers that enter into contract,
  then the participant must propose a breakdown of this proposed revenue structure,
  articulate the scale at which the revenue structure would cover the participant’s
  costs, and articulate how it will test willingness-to-pay by the relevant parties.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<a

judging-criteria-description-3: In addition to considering the scores the submissions
  receive for the evaluation criteria described in Section 3, the DOE selection
  official may also consider geographic diversity as a selection factor. Participants
  that operate in overlapping geographies may hinder each other’s proposed work
  (e.g. by engaging the same innovator population). Therefore, if two or more
  of the four highest scoring entries for the Initial Prize exist in overlapping
  geographies, the DOE selection official may apply the selection factor to skip
  a higher ranked submission in favor of a lower scored submission where the lower
  scored submission represents a geographic area not represented by other high
  scoring submissions.

description: 'Please visit <a href="http://www.build4scale.org">Build4Scale.org </a>for
  more details and to register for the prize!  <ul>    <li><em>The challenge<strong>:</strong>
  </em>American innovators are inventing transformative energy technologies every
  day, but two critical issues prevent those inventions from being manufactured here
  in the United States:  <ul>    <li>Energy technology prototypes developed domestically
  are often not manufacturable because American scientists and engineers are not taught
  the fundamentals of manufacturing. This lack of manufacturing design knowledge leads
  to errors that are prohibitively costly to correct downstream. As a result, fewer
  U.S. energy technologies are manufactured and transition to market.</li>    <li>Because
  American technology inventors and manufacturers are largely disconnected and do
  not engage with each other, many inventors outsource their design and manufacturing
  to product design firms. These firms often send manufacturing contracts overseas,
  contributing to the offshore manufacturing of American inventions.</li>  </ul>  </li>    <li><em>The
  solution</em>: The AIM Onshore competition incentivizes intermediary organization
  to provide services that address these challenges:  <ul>    <li>Providing manufacturing
  fundamentals training to American innovators (scientists and engineers), <em>leading
  to more manufacturable and market-ready prototypes.</em></li>    <li>Forging partnerships
  between innovators and domestic manufacturers, <em>making it easier for technologies
  invented in the United States to be manufactured onshore.</em></li>  </ul>  </li>    <li><em>The
  result</em>: DOE’s AIM Onshore competition is supporting American economic growth
  and prosperity by ensuring that ideas in the lab can translate into real world products,
  bolstering U.S. manufacturingjobs.</li>  </ul>  The National Renewable Energy Laboratory
  (NREL), the prize administrator, will initially screen submissions for compliance
  with the Official Rules. The screened submissions will then be scored by a panel
  ofjudges on a scale of 0-100 points (one hundred being the highest) in the categories
  described below. The average score in each category will be computed, and the average
  scores will be combined to compute a total score. The entries with the highest final
  scores will be recommended for selection for the initial prize.'
