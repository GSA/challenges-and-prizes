  #### Description


  Consider a scenario where developers, data scientists, machine learning (ML) engineers, etc., have access to training-quality datasets via the Overmatch Software Armory’s (OSA) secure, shore-based, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) enabled environment. Pipelined training-quality datasets are stored in Apache Parquet format and readily available for query, discovery, and retrieval from RESTful Services via Swagger UI, Command Line Interface (CLI), and/or the Java software development kit (SDK). The OSA environment also provides access to pertinent artificial intelligence (AI) tooling, e.g. Anaconda, Amazon Web Services (AWS) SageMaker, etc., which is used to perform data engineering, build/train ML models, and/or develop AI-enabled capabilities (e.g. Natural Language Processing / Natural Language Understanding (NLP/NLU), reasoning, planning, etc.).


  The AI Prize Challenge, hereinafter referred to as the “Challenge”, is focused on quickly identifying operationally relevant innovations and emerging AI-enabled technologies. Selected participants will be invited to demonstrate candidate technologies in the Overmatch Software Armory (OSA), which will provide participants VDI access to a secure, government-owned Commercial Cloud Service Provider (CCSP). AI technologies are expected to be containerized and deployed to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OSCP) version 4.6.


  Datasets will be made available to participants in two forms: datasets and filesets. Dataset and fileset descriptions are provided in section, **Judging Criteria - AI iRIL, Datasets, and Filesets**.

  #### Judging Criteria


  **Assessment Criteria and Simulation Environment**


  We seek innovative AI-enabled technologies to optimize Warfighter decision-support at machine speed in relevant, maritime environments. The following sections describe the assessment criteria and the iRIL environment.


  **Assessment Criteria – NetANTX Challenge Invitations**


  Conforming white paper and quad chart submissions will be evaluated by a panel of qualified experts using the following criteria which is in descending order of importance:


  * Operational impact of the technology/engineering innovation in the intended mission scenarios and operational environment

  * Estimated technical performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC ROC, etc.) of the technology/engineering innovation against a hold-out dataset

  * Integration complexity of the technology/engineering innovation

  * Technical maturity of the technology/engineering innovation


  When conducting the assessment, the Government reserves the right to take other significant factors as required into consideration, such as:


  * Limitations to use due to Intellectual Property ownership

  * Ease of fielding the technology in existing legacy Naval platforms (e.g. solution that requires many large software dependencies or require significant compute/memory resources, or that run on very specific hardware architectures would be viewed less favorably).

  * Required out-of-band information needed for the AI technology to operate


  Based on this initial assessment of the white papers and quad charts, participants will be invited to participate in the challenge. Selected participants will be notified via email communication and will receive invitations to the challenge question and answer (Q&A) Sessions and iRIL Integration Workshops.


  **Assessment Criteria – AI Prize Challenge**


  Challenge submissions will be evaluated by a panel of qualified AI experts using the following criteria, in descending order of importance:


  * Operational impact of the technology/engineering innovation in the intended mission scenarios and operational environment

  * Technical performance (see below)

  * Integration complexity of the technology/engineering innovation

  * Technical maturity of the technology/engineering innovation


  Technical performance will be judged with metrics appropriate for the submission. Metrics may include: 


  * F1 Score

  * Precision

  * Recall

  * Accuracy

  * AUC ROC

  * Other: teams are encouraged to propose other performance metrics relevant to their submission. Include details of scoring methodology and advantages of the metric for Government review. 


  F1 Score is defined as 2x((precision x recall)/(precision+recall)).


  Precision is defined as is the number of true positives (TP) divided by the number of TPs and false positives (FP).


  Recall is defined as the number of TPs divided by the number of TPs and the number of false negatives (FNs).


  Accuracy is defined as the number of correct predictions made divided by the total number of predictions made, multiplied by 100 to turn it into a percentage.


  AUC ROC is defined as “Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve.” AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve from (0,0) to (1,1). The ROC curve is defined as a graph showing the performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds. This curve plots two parameters: True Positive Rate (TPR) = Recall = TP/(TP+FN) and False Positive Rate (FPR) = FP/(FP+TN).


  Teams are encouraged to include useful data or performance visualizations.


  **AI iRIL, Datasets, and Filesets**


  AI iRIL


  Participants will be provided with VDI access to the OSA environment, which is generically referred to as an iRIL. OSA provides the processes, infrastructure, and tools underpinning these subsystems for application providers. The OSA is comprised of the following components:


  * Naval Research & Development Establishment (NR&DE) Secure Cloud provides Naval R&D labs and its developers with Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, security services, and development tools via a CCSP.

  * Overmatch Software Armory (OSA) Tools and Services is a DON Environment to support accelerated application development while making optimal use of infrastructure.

  * Collaborative Staging Environment (CSE) is a DON environment to support accelerated application integration and testing. The CSE provides a cloud-based production-representative test environment for applications to conduct Integration Testing.

  * Agile Core Services (ACS) Provide an application infrastructure platform with a diverse set of services to enable easy and rapid delivery of mission applications (provide an environment with common tools to help Applications deploy faster)

  * Application Arsenal is an enterprise software distribution, installation, and update service that enables delivery of approved software from Ashore to the Tactical Edge.


  Technologies that require specific hardware, proprietary components, or on-premises management appliances or consoles will not be considered.


  **Prize Award Details**


  Winners will be announced at the conclusion of the AINet ANTX event. NAVWAR will also announce the winners on the Challenge.gov website, the NAVWAR LinkedIN page, media outlets, and social media channels.


  NAVWAR has established $100,000 as the total amount set aside for cash prizes under this Challenge. A $75,000 first place cash prize will be awarded to the winning entry. $25,000 second place cash prizes will also be awarded. In the unlikely event of a tie, NAVWAR will determine an equitable method of distributing the cash prizes. In the event that an entity ineligible of receiving the cash award wins first and/or second place, NAVWAR will determine the equitable method of distributing the cash prizes.


  If a prize goes to a team of participants, NAVWAR will award the cash prize to the individual/team’s point of contact registered via the challenge website, for further distribution to the team, as the team members see fit.


  NAVWAR is executing two simultaneous but independent prize challenges the AINet ANTX. This prize challenge announcement, and the details within, refer specifically to the AI Prize Challenge.

**Release of Claims:**

The participant agrees to release and forever discharge any and all manner of claims, equitable adjustments, actions, suits, debts, appeals, and all other obligations of any kind, whether past or present, known or unknown, that have or may arise from, are related to or are in connection with, directly or indirectly, this challenge or the participant’s submission.

**Compliance with Laws:**

The participant agrees to follow and comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies.

**Governing Law:**

This challenge is subject to all applicable federal laws and regulations. ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

**Other:**

For events throughout the execution of the Challenge, the Government will provide qualified experts to evaluate the submissions, access to virtual collaboration and simulation environments, access to approved laboratories, overall event planning, and coordination of information assurance services. Two assessments will be conducted throughout the Challenge. White paper submissions will be assessed, prior to invitation to participate in the Challenge, which will require participants to develop and integrate their technologies into the iRIL environment.

Because of the number of anticipated challenge entries, NAVWAR cannot and will not make determinations on whether or not third-party materials in the challenge submissions have protectable intellectual property interests. By participating in this challenge, each participant (whether participating individually, as a team, or as a commercial entity) warrants and assures the Government that any data used for the purpose of submitting an entry for this challenge, were obtained legally and through authorized access to such data. By entering the challenge and submitting the challenge materials, the participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Government harmless against any claim, loss or risk of loss for patent or copyright infringement with respect to such third-party interests.

NAVWAR may update the terms of the challenge from time to time without notice. Participants are strongly encouraged to check the website frequently.

If any provision of this challenge is held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable federal law, it will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms and conditions of this challenge.

#### Judging Criteria

**Assessment Criteria and Simulation Environment**

We seek innovative AI-enabled technologies to optimize Warfighter decision-support at machine speed in relevant, maritime environments.  The following sections describe the assessment criteria and the iRIL environment. 

**Assessment Criteria – NetANTX Challenge Invitations** 

Conforming white paper and quad chart submissions will be evaluated by a panel of qualified experts using the following criteria which is in descending order of importance:

* Operational impact of the technology/engineering innovation in the intended mission scenarios and operational environment
* Estimated technical performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC ROC, etc.) of the technology/engineering innovation against a hold-out dataset
* Integration complexity of the technology/engineering innovation
* Technical maturity of the technology/engineering innovation

When conducting the assessment, the Government reserves the right to take other significant factors as required into consideration, such as:

* Limitations to use due to Intellectual Property ownership
* Ease of fielding the technology in existing legacy Naval platforms (e.g. solution that requires many large software dependencies or require significant compute/memory resources, or that run on very specific hardware architectures would be viewed less favorably).
* Required out-of-band information needed for the AI technology to operate

Based on this initial assessment of the white papers and quad charts, participants will be invited to participate in the challenge. Selected participants will be notified via email communication and will receive invitations to the challenge question and answer (Q&A) Sessions and iRIL Integration Workshops.

**Assessment Criteria – AI Prize Challenge**

Challenge submissions will be evaluated by a panel of qualified AI experts using the following criteria, in descending order of importance:

* Operational impact of the technology/engineering innovation in the intended mission scenarios and operational environment
* Technical performance (see below)
* Integration complexity of the technology/engineering innovation
* Technical maturity of the technology/engineering innovation

Technical performance will be judged with metrics appropriate for the submission. Metrics may include: 

* F1 Score
* Precision
* Recall
* Accuracy
* AUC ROC
* Other: teams are encouraged to propose other performance metrics relevant to their submission. Include details of scoring methodology and advantages of the metric for Government review. 

F1 Score is defined as 2x((precision x recall)/(precision+recall)).

Precision is defined as is the number of true positives (TP) divided by the number of TPs and false positives (FP).

Recall is defined as the number of TPs divided by the number of TPs and the number of false negatives (FNs).

Accuracy is defined as the number of correct predictions made divided by the total number of predictions made, multiplied by 100 to turn it into a percentage.

AUC ROC is defined as “Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve.” AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve from (0,0) to (1,1). The ROC curve is defined as a graph showing the performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds. This curve plots two parameters: True Positive Rate (TPR) = Recall = TP/(TP+FN) and False Positive Rate (FPR) = FP/(FP+TN).

Teams are encouraged to include useful data or performance visualizations.

**AI iRIL, Datasets, and Filesets**

AI iRIL

Participants will be provided with VDI access to the OSA environment, which is generically referred to as an iRIL. OSA provides the processes, infrastructure, and tools underpinning these subsystems for application providers. The OSA is comprised of the following components:

* Naval Research & Development Establishment (NR&DE) Secure Cloud provides Naval R&D labs and its developers with Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, security services, and development tools via a CCSP.
* Overmatch Software Armory (OSA) Tools and Services is a DON Environment to support accelerated application development while making optimal use of infrastructure.
* Collaborative Staging Environment (CSE) is a DON environment to support accelerated application integration and testing. The CSE provides a cloud-based production-representative test environment for applications to conduct Integration Testing.
* Agile Core Services (ACS) Provide an application infrastructure platform with a diverse set of services to enable easy and rapid delivery of mission applications (provide an environment with common tools to help Applications deploy faster)
* Application Arsenal is an enterprise software distribution, installation, and update service that enables delivery of approved software from Ashore to the Tactical Edge.

Technologies that require specific hardware, proprietary components, or on-premises management appliances or consoles will not be considered.

**Prize Award Details**

Winners will be announced at the conclusion of the AINet ANTX event. NAVWAR will also announce the winners on the Challenge.gov website, the NAVWAR LinkedIN page, media outlets, and social media channels.

NAVWAR has established $100,000 as the total amount set aside for cash prizes under this Challenge. A $75,000 first place cash prize will be awarded to the winning entry. $25,000 second place cash prizes will also be awarded. In the unlikely event of a tie, NAVWAR will determine an equitable method of distributing the cash prizes. In the event that an entity ineligible of receiving the cash award wins first and/or second place, NAVWAR will determine the equitable method of distributing the cash prizes.

If a prize goes to a team of participants, NAVWAR will award the cash prize to the individual/team’s point of contact registered via the challenge website, for further distribution to the team, as the team members see fit.

NAVWAR is executing two simultaneous but independent prize challenges the AINet ANTX. This prize challenge announcement, and the details within, refer specifically to the AI Prize Challenge. A companion prize challenge, titled the Networks Prize Challenge, has been announced separately on Challenge.gov.
