    <p>The Bureau of Reclamation is seeking innovative solutions to eradicate invasive zebra and quagga mussels from large reservoirs, lakes, and rivers in a cost effective and environmentally sound manner. Invasive mussel infestations pose significant logistical and economic challenges for local communities, recreationists and water managers.

Solutions can be novel treatments or approaches that build upon existing treatments.</p>
