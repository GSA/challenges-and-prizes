        <p><strong><a href="https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/gsa-and-omb-announce-government-effectiveness-advanced-research-center-challenge-winners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GSA and OMB Announce Government Effectiveness Advanced Research Center Challenge Winners</a></strong></p>
        <p><i>Three groups received $300,000 each for innovative solutions to government challenges outlined in the President’s Management Agenda</i></p>
        <p>"The GEAR Center challenge is a creative approach that engages the U.S. research and development system to help government adapt and improve in a rapidly changing world,” said GSA Administrator Emily Murphy.  “It also helped form new partnerships between different industries. These impressive winners will bring innovation led by our world class universities and enterprises to influence how the federal government performs."</p>

        <div class="description">
        <p>The Federal government would benefit from better access to a well-integrated set of partners representing diverse industries and sectors to help resolve our toughest management problems. How can the government improve collaboration with leading private sector organizations, state and local governments, researchers, academic institutions, Federal government representatives, and the public? We cannot keep solving problems the same way and expect different results.</p>
        <h4><strong>What is the GEAR Center?</strong></h4>
        <p>As described in the Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century reform plan, <a href="https://www.performance.gov/GEARcenter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Government Effectiveness Advanced Research (GEAR) Center</a> could bring together experts in disciplines ranging from economics, to computer science, to design thinking, in order to take a creative, data-driven, and interdisciplinary approach to new possibilities in how citizens and government interact. The GEAR Center can help government modernize to close the gap between government and private-sector services and capabilities. This may also lay the groundwork for where Federal operations and services need to be in five, 10, or 20 years.</p>
        <h4><strong>What is the Challenge?</strong></h4>
        <p>This competition challenges "Solvers" (participating individuals, teams or legal entities) to demonstrate the usefulness of a GEAR Center model by describing how this model would tackle one or more of the major challenges facing government described in the current <a href="https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President's Management Agenda</a> (PMA). For example, how should the government approach the introduction of artificial intelligence into operations? How can agencies more efficiently create a clearing house for matching government needs to relevant project ideas and researchers? Are there new ways to better connect diverse expertise across geographies with Federal agencies who can put that expertise to work in support of their missions? How can Federal agencies better prepare and recruit the Federal workforce?</p>
        <p>Before the government invests in a future GEAR Center, it is important to first explore the feasibility of creating these types of partnerships and if they can produce the kinds of quality approaches to problem solving the government needs. This competition is designed to reward the top models and execution strategies that will demonstrate a use case of a potential GEAR Center project by building on existing similar efforts.</p>
        <p>As a first step in formulating the vision for the GEAR Center, in December 2018, the interagency GEAR Team <a href="https://www.performance.gov/GEARcenter/stakeholders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared the results of the Request for Information</a>, in which over 40 entities submitted ideas for what a GEAR Center could be and how it might operate. Now, our goal is to recognize high-potential GEAR Center models by awarding prizes to those that can propose a workable GEAR Center model through a demonstration of how that model would creatively address one or more <a href="https://www.performance.gov/PMA/Presidents_Management_Agenda.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PMA-related challenges</a> (pg. 4, 7-9).</p>
        <h4><strong>What is the Prize?</strong></h4>
        <p>GSA is offering up to three $300,000 cash prizes to the top solutions proposed, as well as selecting up to five additional winners for public recognition. We anticipate that each of the three cash awards will be for solutions that feasibly deliver results tackling different management challenges, but reserve the right to award up to three that propose solutions that address the same PMA-related challenge.</p>
        <p>Solvers may propose GEAR Center solutions that would:&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Transform the way the Federal workforce is recruited, developed, reskilled or deployed.</li>
        <li>Empower external users to access and use Government data for commercial and other public purposes.</li>
        <li>Better connect Federal programs with a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the people they serve, and capture the voice of the customer in order to continuously improve Federal services.</li>
        <li>Solvers can suggest their own ideas to address issues described in the President's Management Agenda.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>On May 13, 2019 we hosted a webinar to answer questions</strong>&nbsp;and allow interested Solvers to connect with experts working on PMA challenges. The webinar was broadcast widely and is available online, along with answers to frequently asked questions:&nbsp; <strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/336330824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webinar</a> | <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/document-library/GEAR-Center-Challenge-QA---Update-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frequently Asked Questions</a></strong></p>

        <h4><strong>Details on How to Submit Your Solutions Across Each Phase Are Provided Below:</strong></h4>
        <p>The competition will run through three phases. In the first, Solvers will be evaluated on their proposal (including any proposal to scale or grow existing initiatives) to deliver a relevant solution to a PMA-related challenge. The second phase will evaluate invited semi-finalists to share a more in-depth project plan and how this could be executed, as well as how this project supports a longer-term GEAR Center vision. In the third phase, finalists will be invited to present their proposals to a panel of Federal executives through 60-minute virtual meetings.</p>
        <p>In both phases requiring documents, entries must consist of PDF files with font size no smaller than 11-point Arial. All submissions must be in English. The participants must not use GSA's or OMB&'s logos or official seals in the submissions and must not otherwise give an appearance of Federal government endorsement.</p>
        <h5><strong>Phase I:&nbsp; Project Proposal, Opens May 2nd &ndash; Deadline to Submit by May 24th at 5:00 PM EST</strong></h5>
        <p>Solvers submit a no more than two-page proposal (inclusive of any visual representations or graphics), plus the cover sheet specified below, providing the following information:</p>
        <p>Problem Statement:&nbsp; Describe the PMA-related challenge(s) that your project tackles and any relevant background information. Address the impact and innovation potential of your GEAR Center solution given the status quo.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Project Summary:&nbsp; What will your project do over a one year period? How does this align to the vision of the GEAR Center (as described on pp 112-114 of the PDF, <a href="https://www.performance.gov/GovReform/Reform-and-Reorg-Plan-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century:&nbsp; Reform Plan and Reorganization Recommendations</a>)?</li>
        <li>Anticipated Project Results:&nbsp; How can success be measured after one year? How can you use existing administrative data rather than new data collections? Who will ultimately benefit?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Ideal Team to Implement the Proposal:&nbsp; Describe the core team and partners or types of partners that would make for a successful project bringing diversity of industry, affiliation, geography, etc. (important:&nbsp; please write this in a way such that we can redact any organizational names for review).</li>
        <li>Resource Requirements:&nbsp; Describe what might be needed to implement your GEAR Center proposal (resources, stakeholder buy-in, other requirements, etc.). Address the feasibility of your idea. Note that the solution must be able to be delivered within current Federal operations and existing relationships - this award does not enable new Federal authorities or privileged access.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>During Phase I review process, the concept paper will be redacted for both applicant and any specific organizational partner names referenced (versus broader categories of organizational partners), and reviewed by Federal evaluators screened to avoid conflicts of interest.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/gsa-and-omb-announce-government-effectiveness-advanced-research-center-challenge-winners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GSA and OMB Announce Government Effectiveness Advanced Research Center Challenge Winners</a></strong></p>
<p><i>Three groups received $300,000 each for innovative solutions to government challenges outlined in the President’s Management Agenda</i></p>
<p>"The GEAR Center challenge is a creative approach that engages the U.S. research and development system to help government adapt and improve in a rapidly changing world,” said GSA Administrator Emily Murphy.  “It also helped form new partnerships between different industries. These impressive winners will bring innovation led by our world class universities and enterprises to influence how the federal government performs."</p>

### Description


<div class="description">
                          <p>The Federal government would benefit from better access to a well-integrated set of partners representing diverse industries and sectors to help resolve our toughest management problems. How can the government improve collaboration with leading private sector organizations, state and local governments, researchers, academic institutions, Federal government representatives, and the public? We cannot keep solving problems the same way and expect different results.</p>
<h4><strong>What is the GEAR Center?</strong></h4>
<p>As described in the Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century reform plan, <a href="https://www.performance.gov/GEARcenter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Government Effectiveness Advanced Research (GEAR) Center</a> could bring together experts in disciplines ranging from economics, to computer science, to design thinking, in order to take a creative, data-driven, and interdisciplinary approach to new possibilities in how citizens and government interact. The GEAR Center can help government modernize to close the gap between government and private-sector services and capabilities. This may also lay the groundwork for where Federal operations and services need to be in five, 10, or 20 years.</p>
<h4><strong>What is the Challenge?</strong></h4>
<p>This competition challenges "Solvers" (participating individuals, teams or legal entities) to demonstrate the usefulness of a GEAR Center model by describing how this model would tackle one or more of the major challenges facing government described in the current <a href="https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President's Management Agenda</a> (PMA). For example, how should the government approach the introduction of artificial intelligence into operations? How can agencies more efficiently create a clearing house for matching government needs to relevant project ideas and researchers? Are there new ways to better connect diverse expertise across geographies with Federal agencies who can put that expertise to work in support of their missions? How can Federal agencies better prepare and recruit the Federal workforce?</p>
<p>Before the government invests in a future GEAR Center, it is important to first explore the feasibility of creating these types of partnerships and if they can produce the kinds of quality approaches to problem solving the government needs. This competition is designed to reward the top models and execution strategies that will demonstrate a use case of a potential GEAR Center project by building on existing similar efforts.</p>
<p>As a first step in formulating the vision for the GEAR Center, in December 2018, the interagency GEAR Team <a href="https://www.performance.gov/GEARcenter/stakeholders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared the results of the Request for Information</a>, in which over 40 entities submitted ideas for what a GEAR Center could be and how it might operate. Now, our goal is to recognize high-potential GEAR Center models by awarding prizes to those that can propose a workable GEAR Center model through a demonstration of how that model would creatively address one or more <a href="https://www.performance.gov/PMA/Presidents_Management_Agenda.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PMA-related challenges</a> (pg. 4, 7-9).</p>
<h4><strong>What is the Prize?</strong></h4>
<p>GSA is offering up to three $300,000 cash prizes to the top solutions proposed, as well as selecting up to five additional winners for public recognition. We anticipate that each of the three cash awards will be for solutions that feasibly deliver results tackling different management challenges, but reserve the right to award up to three that propose solutions that address the same PMA-related challenge.</p>
<p>Solvers may propose GEAR Center solutions that would:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Transform the way the Federal workforce is recruited, developed, reskilled or deployed.</li>
<li>Empower external users to access and use Government data for commercial and other public purposes.</li>
<li>Better connect Federal programs with a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the people they serve, and capture the voice of the customer in order to continuously improve Federal services.</li>
<li>Solvers can suggest their own ideas to address issues described in the President's Management Agenda.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On May 13, 2019 we hosted a webinar to answer questions</strong>&nbsp;and allow interested Solvers to connect with experts working on PMA challenges. The webinar was broadcast widely and is available online, along with answers to frequently asked questions: <strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/336330824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webinar</a> | <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/document-library/GEAR-Center-Challenge-QA---Update-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frequently Asked Questions</a></strong></p>

### How To Enter


<div class="howtoenter">
        <h4><strong>Details on How to Submit Your Solutions Across Each Phase Are Provided Below:</strong></h4>
<p>The competition will run through three phases. In the first, Solvers will be evaluated on their proposal (including any proposal to scale or grow existing initiatives) to deliver a relevant solution to a PMA-related challenge. The second phase will evaluate invited semi-finalists to share a more in-depth project plan and how this could be executed, as well as how this project supports a longer-term GEAR Center vision. In the third phase, finalists will be invited to present their proposals to a panel of Federal executives through 60-minute virtual meetings.</p>
<p>In both phases requiring documents, entries must consist of PDF files with font size no smaller than 11-point Arial. All submissions must be in English. The participants must not use GSA's or OMB&'s logos or official seals in the submissions and must not otherwise give an appearance of Federal government endorsement.</p>
<h5><strong>Phase I: Project Proposal, Opens May 2nd &ndash; Deadline to Submit by May 24th at 5:00 PM EST</strong></h5>
<p>Solvers submit a no more than two-page proposal (inclusive of any visual representations or graphics), plus the cover sheet specified below, providing the following information:</p>
<p>Problem Statement: Describe the PMA-related challenge(s) that your project tackles and any relevant background information. Address the impact and innovation potential of your GEAR Center solution given the status quo.</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Summary: What will your project do over a one year period? How does this align to the vision of the GEAR Center (as described on pp 112-114 of the PDF, <a href="https://www.performance.gov/GovReform/Reform-and-Reorg-Plan-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century: Reform Plan and Reorganization Recommendations</a>)?</li>
<li>Anticipated Project Results: How can success be measured after one year? How can you use existing administrative data rather than new data collections? Who will ultimately benefit?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ideal Team to Implement the Proposal: Describe the core team and partners or types of partners that would make for a successful project bringing diversity of industry, affiliation, geography, etc. (important: please write this in a way such that we can redact any organizational names for review).</li>
<li>Resource Requirements: Describe what might be needed to implement your GEAR Center proposal (resources, stakeholder buy-in, other requirements, etc.). Address the feasibility of your idea. Note that the solution must be able to be delivered within current Federal operations and existing relationships - this award does not enable new Federal authorities or privileged access.</li>
</ul>
<p>During Phase I review process, the concept paper will be redacted for both applicant and any specific organizational partner names referenced (versus broader categories of organizational partners), and reviewed by Federal evaluators screened to avoid conflicts of interest.</p>
