rules: '<em><strong>Competition Details:</strong></em><br>    <strong>1) Subject of
  Competition:</strong> The SBA is seeking a new design to be used as the official
  logo of the SBIR/STTR Programs and the recently redesigned website <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/"><em>https://www.sbir.gov/</em></a>.
  The SBIR/STTR Programs are extremely competitive and encourage small businesses
  to engage in federally funded research and development (R&amp;D) through eleven
  Federal agencies with R&amp;D needs. SBIR/STTR awards enable small businesses
  to explore their technological potential, stimulate innovation to meet federal
  R&amp;D needs, and potentially profit from private-sector commercialization
  of developed technologies. Since inception in 1982, 150,000 awards totaling
  $40 billion have been awarded to the small firms that participate. The programs
  touch, catalyze and seed the creation of STEM driven innovations in industries
  critical to the nation''s long term competitiveness and growth - from nanotech
  to robotics to mobile communications to genetic therapies to clean energy to
  advanced weapons to space exploration. Many of today’s technology giants – or
  their underlying technological components – received seed funding through SBIR
  or STTR awards via the eleven participating Federal agencies; the Environmental
  Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National
  Science Foundation and the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense,
  Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Home Land Security and Transportation.
  (Visit the <em>sbir.gov</em> website at <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/"><em>https://www.sbir.gov/</em></a>
  for more information.) The new logo will serve as the official logo for the
  SBIR/STTR Programs to be used for promotional and educational information, including
  but not limited to, the Programs’ website, SBA’s website, participating Federal
  agency websites, conferences, events, television, print, and other media outlets.
  The winning logo is intended to premiere at the 2015 Tibbetts Awards ceremony
  on June 15, 2015, and be highlighted at the National SBIR Conference, June 15-17,
  2015.    <strong><br>2) Eligibility Rules for Participating in the Competition:</strong>
  To be eligible to win a prize under this Logo Design Competition, you-    <br>(a)
  Must register to participate in the competition under the link designated for
  that purpose by SBA on <em>challenge.gov</em>;    <br>(b) Must comply with all the
  requirements under this notice and the America Competes Act of 2010 (Pub. L.
  111-358);    <br>(c) Must be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States
  before the submission period ends;    <br>(d) May not be a Federal employee acting
  within the scope of your employment; and,    <br>(e) May not be an entity with an
  outstanding, unresolved financial obligation to, or that is currently suspended
  or debarred by, the federal government.    If you are under 18 years of age,
  you must have the permission of a parent or legal guardian to participate. If
  you are a Federal grantee, you may not use Federal funds to develop applications
  for this competition unless such use is consistent with the purpose of your
  grant award. If you are a Federal contractor, you may not use Federal funds
  from a contract to develop or fund efforts in support of applications for this
  competition. You may use Federal facilities or consult with Federal employees
  during the competition if the facilities and employees are made available to
  all contestants participating in the competition on an equitable basis.    <strong><br>3)
  Registration Process for Participants:</strong> Design competition participants
  must submit their “America’s Seed Fund” Logo Designs online using the link designated
  for that purpose on <em>challenge.gov</em>, either by filtering search criteria
  to “Small Business Administration” or going to <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/"><em>https://www.sbir.gov/</em></a>,
  where the link will be posted.    SBA will accept logo design competition submissions
  only through <em>challenge.gov</em>.    Things to keep in mind as you design
  your “America’s Seed Fund” Logo:    <br>(a) Translating the common programmatic
  elements of the SBIR and STTR programs – to support scientific excellence and
  technological innovation through the investment of Federal research funds in
  critical American priorities to build a strong national economy… one small business
  at a time. (For more information about the SBIR and STTR Programs, visit the
  website at <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/"><em>https://www.sbir.gov/</em></a>.);    <br>(b)
  Reflecting the importance of the SBIR/STTR Programs in an insightful and ultimately
  innovative manner; and,    <br>(c) Evoking through imagery thoughts related to words
  such as – Innovation, Inventions, High-Tech, Cutting Edge, Technology, Startups,
  Seed Money, STEM driven, Angel Funding, Seeding Ideas, Business Plans, Forward-Looking,
  Venture Capital, Widely Applicable, High-Growth Entrepreneurship, National Competitiveness,
  and Next Generation Solutions.    When uploading your “America’s Seed Fund”
  Logo design, in the “Submission Text” field please also include a brief description
  about your logo entry and thought process behind the design – how it relates
  to the SBIR/STTR Programs as “America’s Seed Fund”.    <strong><br>4) Prizes for
  Winners:</strong> The winning contestant will be awarded a $2,500 prize and
  the design will become the official logo for the SBIR/STTR Programs, the Programs’
  website at <em>sbir.gov</em>, and any official SBA, SBIR Program and/or STTR
  Program purpose. The winning contestant will be invited to an unveiling of the
  winning logo design during a White House ceremony honoring the 2015 Tibbetts
  Award and SBIR Hall of Fame winners in Washington, DC, on June 15, 2015. The
  winning contestant will receive a congratulatory letter with winning design
  logo from SBA Administrator Maria Contreras-Sweet. The winning contestant and
  winning logo design will also be recognized during the National SBIR Conference,
  June 15-17, 2015, in National Harbor, MD. Any and all associated travel costs
  will be the sole responsibility of the winning contestant.    <strong><br>5) Selection
  of Winners:</strong> SBA will select a judging panel that will consist of SBA
  officials and Program Managers of the SBIR/STTR participating Federal agencies.
  Judges will be fair and impartial. A judge may not have a familial or financial
  relationship with an individual who is a registered contestant in the competition.
  Judges will fully comply with all applicable government ethics requirements
  for Federal employees.    Judges will use the following criteria to judge the
  submitted designs:    <br>(a) Design relates to the SBIR/STTR Programs as “America’s
  Seed Fund”. The subjects and ideas of small business, innovation, technological
  advancement, commercialization, and research and development need to be conveyed
  in the design of the logo. This may be done through a realistic or abstract
  design.    <br>(b) Creativity and originality. Is the visual quality of the design
  at once informative and representative of imagery connected to the SBIR/STTR
  Programs?    <br>(c) Design can be easily replicated. Can this design be replicated
  successfully, without excessive cost, for many media formats?    The judging
  panel will evaluate the submissions and select up to ten logos to recommend
  to the SBA Administrator, who will choose the final winning design from all
  submissions, including the up to ten logos recommended to the SBA Administrator
  by the judging panel.  SBA will publicly announce the winner and unveil the
  winning logo on June 15, 2015. For questions or further information, please
