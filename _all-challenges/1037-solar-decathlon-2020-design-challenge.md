        <p>The U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon is a collegiate competition that challenges student teams to design and build highly efficient and innovative buildings powered by renewable energy. The winners will be those teams that best blend architectural and engineering excellence with innovation, market potential, building efficiency, and smart energy production.</p>
        <p>The Solar Decathlon &ldquo;pushes the envelope&rdquo; on the design of the high-performance, efficient, affordable, innovative buildings while leveraging opportunities to foster student innovation, STEM education, and workforce development opportunities.</p>
        <p>Collegiate teams that compete in the annual Design Challenge create residential or commercial building designs that will be evaluated on how well they meet the nation&rsquo;s rapidly evolving demand for innovative, cost-effective, quick-to-build, high-quality, resilient, grid-interconnected, efficient buildings that respond to targeted community needs.</p>
        <p>Teams can start preparing for the Solar Decathlon 2020 Design Challenge, planned for April 17&ndash;19, 2020, at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado. Below are key dates for the 2020 Design Challenge:&nbsp; </p>
