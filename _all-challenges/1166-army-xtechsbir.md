  The U.S. Army would like to invite interested companies to participate in the
  xTech Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Direct to Phase II (D2PhII)
  Technology Briefs, being tentatively held 9-13 November 2020. The xTech SBIR
  D2PhII Technology event will provide a forum for small businesses to
  collaborate with the Army, earn prize money, and engage with other
  non-traditional Army partners. Winners of the xTech SBIR D2PhII Technology
  event will be invited to submit a D2PhII SBIR proposal to prototype their
  proposed technology innovations. Prize money will be awarded to selected
  projects through the Army xTech program and D2PhII SBIR awards will be
  available through the Army SBIR program.


  The purpose of the xTech SBIR D2PhII pilot is to accelerate technology prototypes for crucial Army capability gaps into military platform. Submissions will be open to technology solutions that may considerably improve Army platforms, Army weapons systems, or Army support systems in one of the six (6) topic areas listed below.


  The prize challenge will be used to identify small business concerns that meet the criteria for award of a D2PhII contract under 15 U.S.C. §638. Winners of the prize competition will be the only firms eligible to submit a D2PhII SBIR proposal under the topics listed in this announcement. A separate SBIR D2PhII announcement will be issued concurrent with this prize competition announcement.


  The proposed schedule for this challenge is:


  ![Challenge Schedule]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/xtech-sbir.png "Challenge Schedule")


  Submissions that do not address the problem statements below will not be considered for this effort. The efforts described in this Notice are being pursued under the authorities of 10 USC 2374a, 10 USC 2371b, and 15 USC 638. All participants must qualify as a US-based small business concern as defined by 13 C.F.R §§ 701-705 and certify to this upon technology proposal submission. Participants must meet eligibility requirements for Small Business Ownership and Control (see 13 CFR § 121.702). Submissions that do not address the problem statements below or submitted from non U.S.-based companies or organizations will not be considered for the prize competition.


  (For full problem descriptions, please visit the application page or download the “xTech SBIR Topics” document below)


  **Topic A:** Combat Vehicle Modernization – Advanced hybrid networks and cable management strategies


  Problem Statement A: This topic seeks novel concepts for reducing cabling requirements within ground combat vehicles, while minimizing the electronic signature footprint, maintaining or improving data throughput rates/capacities, and improving physical characteristics, such as size and weight. Potential solutions may include one or more transmission mediums.


  **Topic B:** Autonomous Navigation Sensor Technologies


  Problem Statement B: Demonstrate the ability to employ effective passive sensor technologies and associated algorithms and techniques to augment semi-(operator assist capabilities) and fully-autonomous off-road navigation systems for Army Ground Combat Vehicles in Degraded Visual Environments (DVE). The focus of this topic is to augment existing and planned Army autonomous navigation investments and infrastructure (e.g. sensors, data collection, simulation, etc.) leading to improved navigational performance, new capabilities, or SWAP-C (size, weight, power, and cost) reductions.


  **Topic C:** Advanced Real Time Global High-Resolution Environmental Information to Support Multi-Domain Operations


  Problem Statement C: Advanced Real Time Global High-Resolution Environmental Information to Support Multi-Domain Operations for the development and demonstration of a capability that addresses requirements crossing multiple program executive office and program management. The desired end product of Phase II is to have one or more technically feasible technologies operating as functional prototype(s) during DoD-sanctioned exercises in order to provide operational testing and data collection on the cyber security, usability and effectiveness of prototype(s).


  **Topic D**: Ultra Narrow-band Emergency Radio


  Problem Statement D: The Army seeks a radio capability that will enable large numbers of vehicles and soldiers to communicate at extremely low data rates, and with low probability of being detected or geolocated by adversaries. The Army of the future requires mission assured communications that will provide anti-jam “Interference Tolerant Wireless Communications” - addressing C3I capability and advanced expeditionary electronic countermeasures (ECM). The communications must deliver a unique undetectable communication channel which overcomes the difficulties in managing interference. The solution must deliver a frequency-agile communication technology that is effective when operating in harsh radio environments containing significant amounts of interference.


  **Topic E**: Non-Lethal Vehicle Defense System


  Problem Statement E: Army manned and unmanned vehicles must be able to perform their missions in scenarios where they must operate among local populations. The local populations can pose a potential threat to operations, but lethal response measures may not be appropriate. The Army seeks non-lethal solutions that will inhibit or discourage civilians and bystanders from interfering with operations of manned and unmanned platforms.


  **Topic F**: Condition-Based Maintenance for Combat Vehicles


  Problem Statement F: Demonstrate the ability to employ technologies and associated algorithms and techniques via new or existing sensors and telematics to create advanced prognostics and diagnostics methodologies for future and current Army vehicles. The focus of this topic is to anticipate component failures and reduce the amount of unplanned maintenance resulting is increased readiness of the fleet.
