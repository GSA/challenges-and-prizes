    <p>The REACH Lark Award honors extraordinary individuals, organizations, or community coalitions associated with the REACH program for advancing the science and practice of improving health equity to eliminate health disparities at the national, state, or local levels. As participants in the award process, applicants describe how they assisted with and successfully carried out culturally tailored interventions that led to reduced health disparities in chronic conditions including hypertension, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, or obesity and associated risk behaviors of physical inactivity, poor nutrition, or smoking.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Addressed preventable risk behaviors (tobacco use, poor nutrition, and physical inactivity).</li>
    <li>Linked community and clinical efforts to increase access to health care and preventive care programs at the community level.</li>
    <li>Supported implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of practice- and evidence-based strategies related to tobacco use prevention, nutrition, physical activity, or community-clinical linkages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Nominations for this award can help further the goals of the REACH program by documenting and disseminating the innovative interventions that led to reduced health disparities.</p>
prizes: <p>A maximum of one applicant (individual or team) will receive a winner's plaque.
