  one of the award categories. Log on to <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">www.challenge.gov</a>,
  and search for 2016 Excellence in AmeriCorps Programming and Service on the
  homepage. Once you open the AmeriCorps nomination form (it’s called a Solution
  in <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">www.challenge.gov</a>), you’ll see links
  on the left-side of the page that include Challenge Details, Discussions, Solutions,
  Rules, and Submit Solution. Open each of the Challenge Details and Rules links
  to find all the details on the AmeriCorps awards: the eligibility criteria,
  the award categories, the nomination narrative instructions, and tips for writing
  the nomination. Enter the award category and full name of the nominee in the
  Title field on the Submit Solution link. Complete the nomination narrative and
  attach photos in the Description field of the Submit Solution link. Open the
  Discussions link to ask a question about the nomination process, form, etc.
  The online system will generate an automated message when your Solution is submitted
  successfully. Be sure to check your email''s spam filter or clutter to confirm
  that you received the notification.    <strong>Award Categories--Select from
  only one of the following for each nomination:</strong>  <ol>   <li>Best new
  program design addressing a critical priority (new is a program launched since
  September 2014);</li>   <li>Most significant enhancement to an existing program;</li>   <li>Member
  with disability (ies) who significantly contributed to increasing the participation
  of other individuals with disabilities in national service; or</li>   <li>Most
  compelling member experience in either building an ethic of civic responsibility
  or having positive change in their life.</li>  </ol>  <strong>Nominees should
  select only one award category and one program affiliation per submission.</strong>    Submit
  a narrative of up to 500 words that clearly and concisely describes the nominee’s
  best program design, enhancement, expansion, or experience and accomplishments
  as a member for the award category selected. Ideally, the narrative will include
  evidence of the nominee’s impact in the community or on the program or other
  local projects, as well as evidence to support the nominee’s work or service
  as innovative, a best practice and/or a highly compelling and motivating experience.    Submissions
  may also include photos. Photos should support the narrative submission and
  not replace it. Photos are encouraged as they are often very helpful in telling
  the complete service story. Please note that photos are not required.    By
  submitting a nomination, each participant automatically confers on CNCS an irrevocable,
  nonexclusive, and unrestricted license to use the submitted content for purposes
  consistent with the agency’s national service mission. This includes the right
  to copy, reproduce, display, or distribute the content of the submission, and
  to make derivative works based upon the submission or a substantial portion
  of it without attribution or prior permission.    <br><strong>Deadline for Submissions:</strong>    Submissions
  must be entered by 5:00 PM, EDT on Monday, June 6, 2016.    <br><strong>Format for
  Submissions:</strong>    Nominations must be submitted online.    <br><strong>Limitations:</strong>    Individuals
  and programs may submit no more than one nominee in each award category. However,
  individuals may not nominate themselves; self-nominations will not be eligible
  for review. Nominators are highly encouraged to focus on the quality of the
  nomination submitted – and not the quantity of nominations submitted.    <br><strong>Tips
  for Writing the Nomination:</strong>  <ol>   <li>Enter the award category and
  full name of the nominee in the Title field in the Submit Solution link.</li>   <li>Clearly
  identify the full name of the nominee, the service program affiliation, and
  the award category in the first sentence of the nomination narrative.</li>   <li>Provide
  the name of the nominator and the nominator’s affiliation with the nominee in
  the second sentence of the nomination.</li>   <li>Select <u>only one program
  affiliation and only one nomination category</u> for each submission. In the
  event a program and individual are both eligible to be nominated, submit two
  separate nominations: one for the new or enhanced program and one for the member,
  following the award category descriptions.</li>   <li>Provide details that vividly
  illustrate the significance of the nominated member service/program. Details
  should clearly show how the nominated service goes above and beyond the excellent
  service that is expected from all AmeriCorps members and programs each year.</li>   <li>Complete
  all required fields of the nomination form, including full contact information
  for the nominator and nominee.</li>   <li>Please be sure to tailor the nomination
  narrative to the Excellence in AmeriCorps Service and Programming guidelines.</li>  </ol>  <strong>Frequently
  Asked Questions and Answers:</strong>    <em>--Could you provide the definition
  of “AmeriCorps programming?” In order for a program to be eligible for a program
  award, does it have to be funded entirely through AmeriCorps, or is it sufficient
  that VISTA members serve and contribute to the program?</em>    Answer: AmeriCorps
  programming can mean a program that is entirely focused on and funded by AmeriCorps,
  or the program can be multi-faceted and include a variety of activities (with
  only one AmeriCorps component). Based on your description, it sounds like the
  VISTA member service could apply. The nomination narrative would provide more
  details on the focused effort of the VISTAs, results, etc.    <em>--Is there
  a word limit on the nominations?</em>    Answer: Yes, the nomination narrative
  should not exceed 500 words.    <em>--How do I submit a nomination?</em>    Answer:
  Log on to <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">www.challenge.gov</a>, and search
  for 2016 Excellence in AmeriCorps Programming and Service on the homepage. Once
  you open the AmeriCorps nomination form (it’s called a Solution in <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">www.challenge.gov</a>),
  you’ll see links on the left-side of the page that include Challenge Details,
  Discussions, Solutions, Rules, and Submit Solution. Open Challenge Details and
  Rules to find all the details on the AmeriCorps awards: the eligibility criteria,
  the award categories, the nomination narrative instructions, and tips for writing
  the nomination. The nomination narrative should be entered in the Description
  field on the Submit Solution link on the left-side of the award page. Enter
  the full name of the nominee in the Title field on the Submit Solution link.
  Open the Discussions link to ask a question about the nomination process, form,
  etc. Complete the nomination narrative and attach photos in the Description
  field of the Submit Solution link. The online system will generate an automated
  message when your Solution is submitted successfully. Be sure to check your
  email''s spam filter or clutter to confirm that you received the notification.    <em>--I
  understand that self-nominations are not eligible; however, can a program director
  nominate her own program for one of the program categories?</em>    Answer:
  A program staff member may nominate her program in one of the two program categories,
  and a program may nominate a member or alumna/us from its own program for one
  of the member categories.    <em>--Do you have an example of a successful nomination
  submission?</em>    Answer: Yes, open the Solutions link on the left-side of
  the www.challenge.gov award page, and you''ll see a Solution called EXAMPLE.'

description: '<p>In honor of retired US Senator Tom Harkin, an inspiring champion for
  national service, the Corporation for National and Community Service will present
  the <strong>“Excellence in AmeriCorps Programming and Service Awards.”</strong>  Our
  goal for these awards is to recognize outstanding and innovative programs and high
  quality and meaningful AmeriCorps service experiences (for current members and alumni).    Just
  as Senator Harkin sought to expand “what worked” throughout his career, we want
  these awards to encourage the development and expansion of best practices in national
  service programming, improved project development, and increase the value of the
  AmeriCorps member experience to help tackle the country’s most pressing human and
  environmental needs through service.</p><p>With emphases on engaging individuals with
  disabilities in service, program innovation and enhancements, and compelling AmeriCorps
  member experiences, the awards reflect the depth of impact of the national service
  field on the communities served and the individuals serving.    These awards will
  allow the Corporation for National and Community Service to share excellent program
  strategies and models with the national service field and the general public so
  that individuals, nonprofits, government agencies, schools, and more will be aware
  of the excellent and diverse range of national service programs across the country.</p>    Check
  out the 2015 award recipients here:    Press Release: <a href="http://www.nationalservice.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/first-annual-harkin-awards-honor-americorps-members-programs">http://www.nationalservice.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/first-annual-harkin-awards-honor-americorps-members-programs</a>
