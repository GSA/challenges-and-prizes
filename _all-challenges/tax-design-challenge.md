description: '<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Taxpayers have the right to be informed,

  information reads like a receipt and can be hard to understand for those who are
  not finance professionals.</span></p>  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The goal of
  this challenge is to reimagine the taxpayer experience and design the taxpayer experience
  of the future. With over 200 data fields at play, how might we design, organize,

  their taxpayer responsibilities, and to use their own taxpayer data to make informed
  and effective decisions about their personal finances?</span></p>  <em><strong><em>  Background
  Materials</em></strong></em>    The variables in the Tax Data Document (TDD) represent
  the type of personalized data that may comprise a person’s tax information, including
  refund status, transactions, and line-by-line tax return information for specific
  tax years. Entrants should use some or all of these variables as part of their submission
  for an improved experience. Use of every variable in the TDD is not required; submissions
  may include additional variables that are not in the TDD.    <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/TaxDataDocument.xlsx"
