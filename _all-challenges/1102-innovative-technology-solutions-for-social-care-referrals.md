description: <p>At an unprecedented pace, Federal and state leaders, community
  based organizations, and all avenues of the health care system are expending
  their time and resources to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. We at ACL
  recognize the need and are expanding the timeline of this new funding
  opportunity. The Challenge Competition will now begin in July. As a result of
  this crises, there is a greater need for enhanced, standardized data tracking
  and referral processes and an even more need to connect people with the right
  community resources and supports. This will continue to be a priority as we
  think about the resources necessary to address the effects of COVID-19.</p>
  <p><strong>Today&rsquo;s Landscape of Health and Social Care Coordination for
  Older Adults and People with Disabilities:</strong></p> <p>Individual health
  plans and health systems are implementing technology approaches to screen and
  refer individuals to community resources in order to address their social
  needs and improve their health and overall well-being. However, the existing
  technology solutions lack interoperability and scalability within and across
  communities. Since 2003, states and community based organizations<sup>1</sup>
  (CBOs) have invested in robust resource directory and referral platforms
  through state <a href="https://nwd.acl.gov/">No Wrong Door (NWD) System</a>
  integration to streamline access to long term services and supports for older
  adults, individuals with disabilities, and their caregivers. State NWD Systems
  include a community based approach to person-centered planning and assessment,
  information and referral to state and community resources, and a governance
  structure that ensures these functions are available across the state.
  However, provider and plan specific referral platforms are often not
  leveraging this existing infrastructure that enables access to a variety of
  services and supports that address social needs.</p> <p>While some states have
  developed or are planning statewide technology platforms that enable social
  risk assessments and referrals from health care to community resources, there
  is a need for a more collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach that ensures
  the interoperability and scalability of such platforms.<sup>2</sup> As is,
  there is duplicative spending across stakeholders as they independently
  contract for different referral vendors to secure community connections. As a
  result, community based organizations are faced with the burden of accessing
  multiple platforms to receive and act on referrals. Opportunities to manage
  populations across a continuum of care are also limited when individuals seek
  care from providers with differing platforms that lack seamless connections to
  critical health and social care.</p> <p>The need for seamless exchange of
  referrals is also met with optimizing data on social determinants of health
  (SDoH) to ensure individuals get timely access to services and supports they
  need such as housing, nutrition, and transportation. Over the last several
  years, a variety of community led efforts are developing industry-wide
  standards to represent these components of SDoH and to enable exchange of
  person-centered data between health information technology platforms and
  CBOs.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp; One such effort, perhaps the largest such activity in
  the SDoH space, is the Gravity Project.<sup>4</sup> The Gravity Project aims
  to standardize medical codes and exchange standards to facilitate the use of
  SDoH-related data across a wide range of care management settings between
  health care and human services providers, and others as authorized and
  appropriate. There is a need for health plans and systems to require and for
  technology vendors to uniformly adopt technical standards, which are being
  developed and tested. This include standards on the format, content and
  structure of SDoH data, community resource directories, and bi-directional
  exchange of referral messages.&nbsp; The mid-to-long term goal is consistent
  implementation of standards for SDoH data, bi-directional exchange of
  referrals, and resource directories across technology platforms that serve
  health care and CBOs.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong></p> <p>The
  Administration for Community Living (ACL), U.S. Department of Health and Human
  Services (HHS) is announcing a competition for state and community leaders in
  the aging and disability network, health care systems, health plans, and
  health IT vendors to cultivate care coordination by developing and/or
  optimizing interoperable and scalable technology platforms. Participants are
  challenged with working collaboratively on enhancing scalable approaches to
  securely sharing standardized data on social determinants and person-centered
  plans through the use of open resource directories that seamlessly connect and
  interoperate with health care system&rsquo;s electronic health records to
  community based organizations. This Challenge includes developing prototypes
  and implementing technical solutions that track referral patterns and gaps in
  service that visibly display social service and health related outcomes
  overtime.</p> <p>To demonstrate value and achieve seamless network
  integration, technical solutions are challenged with incorporating closed-loop
  referral and follow-up protocols to track and support individuals when they
  obtain services from any organization or health care provider within the
  network. Producing data on the individual, organizational, and regional levels
  about referrals, the prevalence of SDoH, and service utilization and outcomes
  guarantees opportunities to strengthen coordinated referral networks across
  CBOs, states, and the health care system. Technology-based platforms that
  enable linkages between healthcare providers and the existing ecosystem of
  community-based, social service organizations are challenged to more
  efficiently share standardized data to support referral processes and better
  informed decision-making, ensuring that individuals are seamlessly connected
  to resources that address their preferences, goals, values, and social
  determinants in ways that promote independence in the community for as long as
  possible.</p> <p>Critical partners for designing solutions to this Challenge
  should include a team of key stakeholders. Strong preference will be given to
  teams that include state leaders across aging, disability and Medicaid
  programs (or their designees), community based organizations in the aging and
  disability networks, health IT developers, health care providers, health
  plans, and others with expertise in technical standards, interoperability and
  data analysis.</p> <p>The Challenge will compete in three phases with cash
  prizes awarded in each phase. The total prize award available is $500,000.
  &nbsp;</p> <p>Phase 1:&nbsp; Concept &amp; Design Submission (July &ndash;
  December 2020)</p> <ul> <li>Form multi-stakeholder team, submit letter of
  intent and develop idea and concept designs that include data visualization
  methods and functional enhancements to technology platforms that connect
  health and social services. <ul> <li><strong><u>Intent to apply:</u></strong>
  An individual, entity, or captain of a team, with support of all team members,
  is to provide a brief letter of intent to submit an application for this
  Challenge. Email letter of intent by August 14, 2020 to <a
  href="mailto:ami.patel@acl.hhs.gov">ami.patel@acl.hhs.gov</a></li> </ul> </li>
  </ul> <p>Phase 2:&nbsp; Proof of Concept &amp; Demonstration (January 2021
  &ndash; June 2021)</p> <ul> <li>Participant teams will convene in-person or
  virtually to demo proposed solutions.</li> </ul> <p>Phase 3:&nbsp;
  Implementation &amp; Testing - (July &ndash; December 2021)</p> <ul>
  <li>Implementation and real-world testing of designed approach.</li> </ul>
  <p><strong><u>What is a Challenge?</u></strong></p> <p>A challenge (also
  referred to as "prize challenge,&rdquo; "competition," "prize competition,"
  "incentive prize" or any combination thereof) allows the public to solve
  problems presented by federal agencies and receive awards for the best
  solutions. This boils down to three steps:</p> <ol> <li>Agency announces a
  problem to the public.</li> <li>Participants create and submit solutions to
  the problem.</li> <li>Agency evaluates solutions and awards prizes to the best
  ones.</li> </ol> <p>This process may sound similar to grants or contracts, but
  challenges differ in small and significant ways. In grants and contracts an
  agency receives proposals to do work, chooses one and then pays the monetary
  award incrementally as the work is done. In challenges, an agency generally
  selects winner(s) after assessing work that has been completed. In more
  complex, multi-phase challenges, phase winners may be selected progressively
  as development stages are completed.</p> <p>Unlike contracts in particular,
  which provide detailed and comprehensive specifications of the work that needs
  to be done, challenges define a smaller set of requirements, which allows
  participants to bring more of their own creativity to solutions.&nbsp; This
  can be advantageous when a problem can be solved many different ways,
  including ways that the agency is not even aware of.&nbsp; The open-ended
  approach can entice participation from those who may not have direct expertise
  in the problem subject matter area but can lend expertise from their diverse
  backgrounds.</p> <p>Challenges can serve multiple goals beyond sourcing
  solutions to problems, including:</p> <ul> <li>Signal interest in an area that
  you think markets should be doing more to serve</li> <li>Reach wide
  communities of experts</li> <li>Deliver messages to the public in a fun,
  interactive way</li> <li>Generate interest in new services, data or
  technologies your agency provides</li> <li>Develop public buy-in for agency
  initiatives</li> </ul> <p>For more information, please visit:&nbsp; <a

<p><strong>The Challenge:</strong></p>
<p>The Administration for Community Living (ACL), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is announcing a competition for state and community leaders in the aging and disability network, health care systems, health plans, and health IT vendors to cultivate care coordination by developing and/or optimizing interoperable and scalable technology platforms.

<p>The Challenge will compete in three phases with cash prizes awarded in each phase. The total prize award available is $500,000. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Phase 1: Concept &amp; Design Submission (July &ndash; December 2020)</p>
<ul>
<li>Form multi-stakeholder team, submit letter of intent and develop idea and concept designs that include data visualization methods and functional enhancements to technology platforms that connect health and social services.
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Intent to apply:</u></strong> An individual, entity, or captain of a team, with support of all team members, is to provide a brief letter of intent to submit an application for this Challenge. Email letter of intent by August 14, 2020 to <a href="mailto:ami.patel@acl.hhs.gov">ami.patel@acl.hhs.gov</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase 2: Proof of Concept &amp; Demonstration (January 2021 &ndash; June 2021)</p>

</ul>
<p><strong><u>What is a Challenge?</u></strong></p>
<p>A challenge (also referred to as "prize challenge,&rdquo; "competition," "prize competition," "incentive prize" or any combination thereof) allows the public to solve problems presented by federal agencies and receive awards for the best solutions. This boils down to three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Agency announces a problem to the public.</li>
<li>Participants create and submit solutions to the problem.</li>
<li>Agency evaluates solutions and awards prizes to the best ones.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process may sound similar to grants or contracts, but challenges differ in small and significant ways. In grants and contracts an agency receives proposals to do work, chooses one and then pays the monetary award incrementally as the work is done. In challenges, an agency generally selects winner(s) after assessing work that has been completed. In more complex, multi-phase challenges, phase winners may be selected progressively as development stages are completed.</p>
<p>Unlike contracts in particular, which provide detailed and comprehensive specifications of the work that needs to be done, challenges define a smaller set of requirements, which allows participants to bring more of their own creativity to solutions.&nbsp; This can be advantageous when a problem can be solved many different ways, including ways that the agency is not even aware of.&nbsp; The open-ended approach can entice participation from those who may not have direct expertise in the problem subject matter area but can lend expertise from their diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>Challenges can serve multiple goals beyond sourcing solutions to problems, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signal interest in an area that you think markets should be doing more to serve</li>
<li>Reach wide communities of experts</li>
<li>Deliver messages to the public in a fun, interactive way</li>
<li>Generate interest in new services, data or technologies your agency provides</li>
<li>Develop public buy-in for agency initiatives</li>
