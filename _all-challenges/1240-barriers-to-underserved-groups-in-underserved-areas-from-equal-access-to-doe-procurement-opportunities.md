  The federal government is committed to pursuing a comprehensive approach to
  improve diversity and equity in the federal marketplace for those who have
  been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by
  persistent poverty and inequality, such as:


  * Business owners who are people of color; 

  * Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities; (TCUs), and Minority Serving Institution (MSIs); 

  * Businesses located in historically underutilized business zone (HUBZone) areas; and

  * Persons with disabilities.


  The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) in the Executive Office of the President and the Department of Energy’s (DOE) are co-hosting a two-week crowdsourcing campaign to identify barriers faced by underserved groups that prevent them from full and equal access to federal procurement opportunities.


  In order to remedy inequities in access and opportunity for historically underserved groups, we must first identify barriers that restrict these groups from full and equal participation in the federal marketplace. Only after identifying barriers experienced in the federal marketplace, can we take targeted action to dismantle obstacles embedded in the federal acquisition system and formulate solutions that promote equity in federal procurement activities.


  **Challenge Question**: What barriers for historically underserved groups should be addressed in order to achieve full and equal participation in federal prime and subcontracting opportunities?


  **Challenge Focus Areas**:  All ideas are welcome, but we are specifically interested in input on:


  * Specific contracting policies, procedures, and practices creating disparities in outcomes and inequities in access and opportunity

  * Real-world examples/experiences that illustrate barriers faced by historically underserved groups

  * Patterns or trends, supported by data, that indicate inequity

  * Barriers unique to or associated with science and research procurements  


  **Key Dates**


  The crowdsourcing campaign will remain open from June 1 to June 15, 2021.
prizes: >-
  Monetary prize awards are not being offered as part of this Challenge.


  #### Non-monetary Prizes


  By participating in this challenge, you will contribute to the list of barriers that will be used by DOE and OFPP to inform future plans to dismantle obstacles embedded in the federal acquisition system in order to promote equity in the federal marketplace. 


  You will also have a share in supporting the Department of Energy and OFPP's work related to the Executive Order 13985 Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government.
