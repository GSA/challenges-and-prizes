rules: "<strong>1.0          Definitions</strong>    <br>1.1.         3D Printing
  – See Additive Manufacturing    <br>1.2.         Additive Manufacturing – Synonymous
  with the term “3D Printing”. Any process used to produce a three dimensional
  physical object by deposition of material.    <br>1.3.         Automated/Autonomous
  – The use of machines, mechanisms, and technology to make processes or systems
  run without human guidance or power.    <br>1.4.         Indigenous – Originating
  in and characteristic of a particular region.    <br>1.5.         In-Situ Resources
  – Indigenous materials that pre-exist at the construction site, or recyclable
  materials produced from the waste stream of the mission or supply chain.    <br>1.6.        
  Recycled/Recyclable Materials – Used or waste materials that may be processed
  for reuse.    <br>1.7.         Semi-Autonomous –This term refers to a system which
  is automated but may require some human interaction to perform basic functions.
  For instance, a semi-autonomous 3D printing system may require human interaction
  to perform certain control decisions and maintenance functions.    <br>1.8.        
  Team – an individual, or group of individuals, submitting a design entry for
  competition. There is no limit to the number of individuals on a Team.   <p></p> <strong>2.0         
  3D-Printed Habitat Challenge Overview</strong>    <br>2.1.         The 3D-Printed
  Habitat Challenge seeks to develop the fundamental technologies necessary to
  manufacture an off-world habitat using mission recycled materials and/or local
  indigenous materials. The vision is that autonomous habitat manufacturing machines
  will someday be deployed to the Moon or Mars to construct shelters for human
  habitation.    <br>2.2.         On Earth these same habitat manufacturing capabilities
  could be used to produce housing wherever affordable housing is needed and access
  to conventional building materials and skills is limited. On Earth, it is envisioned
  that local indigenous materials (dirt, clay, sand, etc.) could be combined with
  readily available recyclable materials and used to construct semi-permanent
  shelters against environmental elements for human habitation.    <br>2.3.        
  The goal of the 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge is to foster the development of
  new technologies necessary to additively manufacture a habitat using local indigenous
  materials with, or without, recyclable materials. The challenge is broken into
  three parts as described below. This document will focus on the requirements
  and rules associated with the Design Competition only. The complete 3D-Printed
  Habitat Challenge rules, including Level 1 and 2, will be made available Fall
  2015.    <br>2.3.1.     Design Competition - focused on developing innovative habitat
  architectural concepts that take advantage of the unique capabilities that 3D
  printing offers.    <br>2.3.2.     Structural Member Competition (Level 1) - focused
  on the core fabrication technologies needed to manufacture structural components
  from indigenous materials combined with recyclables, or indigenous materials
  alone.   <br>2.3.3.     On-Site Habitat Competition (Level 2) - focused on the
  fabrication of a full-scale habitat using indigenous materials combined with
  recyclables, or indigenous materials alone.   <p></p> <strong>3.0          Design Competition
  Vision</strong>    <br>3.1.         Meet our (fictional) NASA crew of four, who
  have been chosen for their grit, grace and intellect to be the first humans
  ever to step foot on Mars. As they prepare for their long journey to the red
  planet in 2035, they are undergoing a training program wherein they will reside
  in approximately 1000 ft2 of living space for 1 year. Their new adopted home
  should contain everything needed to comfortably sustain human life, including
  cooking areas, sleeping quarters and bathroom facilities. Their jobs as geologists,
  land surveyors, prospectors, scientists, biologists, &amp; engineers should
  also be considered while creating this structure, as it will act as a prototype
  for the one that they'll reside in while on Mars.    <br>3.2.         This Earth-based
  training habitat must be constructed by the group, semi-autonomously, using
  3D-printing technologies and in-situ resources. Your mission, if you choose
  to accept it, is to design this habitat for our crew to use in this training
  exercise.    <br>3.3.         NASA has completed past studies which may be used
  as references. New technologies and approaches (such as 3D printing) will enable
  new approaches and mission architectures in the future, so these documents should
  be treated as references only – improvements are sought and encouraged. The
  references are made available on the challenge website (americamakes.us/challenge/references).
  \  <p></p> <strong>4.0          Design Competition Rules</strong>    <br>4.1.         Each
  team, or individual, admitted to the challenge shall generate an architectural
  design concept for a habitat. The design must fulfill the habitat needs of four
  astronauts as described in 3.1.    <br>4.2.         All architectural design concepts
  must be self-supporting structures that incorporate a foundation. Additionally,
  invited competitors must provide a 3D-Printed scaled physical design model of
  their concept for on-site final judging at the 2015 New York City Maker Faire.
  Therefore, the architectural design concept must be self-supporting in 1 Earth
  gravity.    <br>4.2.1.     The 3D-Printed model may be constructed using any current
  additive manufacturing process and material, so long as the final product is
  safe for public display.    <br>4.2.2.     The 3D-Printed model must meet size requirements
  as described in 5.4.4.    <br>4.3.         Competitors are required to provide novel,
  functional, and efficient, architectural design concepts that are enabled by
  innovative 3D-printing techniques for construction.    <br>4.4.         Designs
  may include up to 1000 ft2 (92.9 m2) of living space. The use of this space
  must be optimized for the comfort and utility of four resident astronauts. Consideration
  should be given to life sustaining needs, research tasks, and recreational activities.
  \   <br>4.5.         Competitors must specify the region on Mars where the ultimate
  habitat will be constructed, and propose a suitable analog location for the
  Earth-based training habitat described in 3.2. As on Earth, Mars has environmentally
  favorable and hostile regions. Competitors should use reference material to
  become familiar with Martian weather and/or latitude advantages.    <br>4.6.        
  Designs must include a minimum of three 45 ft3 (1.3 m3) spaces allocated for
  Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) equipment. ECLSS equipment
  will be needed to provide such things as clean water and oxygen, but also regulate
  air quality, pressure, and temperature. Current ECLSS systems take up approximately
  1.3 m3 space.    <br>4.7.         The design should focus on the habitable structure.
  While submission of detailed electrical, plumbing and ducting plans are not
  required, locations of electrical outlets, fluid supplies and drains, and ventilation
  registers should be included.    <br>4.8.         The interior of the 3D-Printed
  model must be viewable. The 3D-Printed subscale model must incorporate a removable
  section so that the habitat interior design may be viewed by judges and spectators.
  \  <p></p> <strong>5.0          Design Submission and Competitor down select Process</strong>
  \   <br>5.1.         Not all competitors who register will be admitted into the
  final design competition to be held at the 2015 New York City Maker Faire. There
  will be a down selection process as described below. The 3D-Printed Habitat
  Challenge schedule as posted on the competition website (AmericaMakes.us/challenge)
  should be referenced for deadlines and closure dates.    <br>5.2.         Invitation

  necessary to manufacture an off-world habitat using local indigenous materials with
  the optional to add mission recycled materials. The long-term vision is that habitat-manufacturing
  machines could someday be deployed to the Moon, Mars or beyond to autonomously prepare
  shelters for the human explorers who follow. On Earth, these capabilities could
  be used to construct affordable housing wherever needed – where access to conventional
  building materials and skills are limited. <p></p>   The 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge was
  formulated in conjunction with the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute
  (aka America Makes). America Makes is the Allied Organization, thus the final arbiter
  and executioner of all tasks, for the 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge. Centennial Challenges
  Program is providing the prize money for the 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge.  <p></p>  The
  3D-Printed Habitat Challenge will be conducted in two phases: the Design Competition,
  followed by the two additive manufacturing, or construction, competitions – Level
  1 and Level 2 Competitions (to be released in September 2015). Any registered competing
  individual or team may participate in any or all of the competitions under the umbrella
  title 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge.  <p></p>  The Design Competition is an architectural
  design activity which invites competitors to design a habitat which utilizes additive
  construction advantages over traditional construction. The Design Competition will
  open registration May 16, 2015, and finalize composite scores on September 27, 2015.
  Potential competitors will submit a registration package. Accepted competitors will
  continue to the next step of the Design Competition by submitting a Design Entry.
  The top 30 competitors will be notified that they may proceed to the next (and final)
  step of the Design Competition. The top 30 competitors will then finalize the Design
  Entry and 3D-print a habitat design subscale model.  <p></p>  The 3D subscale model will
  be displayed at the NYC Maker Faire from September 24, 2015 to September 27, 2015.
  A composite score will be determined using the Judges’ scoring and public appeal,
  resulting in an overall ranking. Prizes will be awarded during ceremonies at the
  NYC Maker Faire on September 27, 2015. <p></p>   The Design Competition will award a first
  place prize of $25,000, a second place prize of $15,000, and a third place prize
  of $10,000 (all provided by CCP). America Makes is considering adding additional
  prizes, such as People’s Choice Award, Honorable Mention, Best in Class, and a Participant
  Award.</p>'
