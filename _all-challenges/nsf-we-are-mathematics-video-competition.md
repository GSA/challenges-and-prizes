  People's Choice Award</strong></p>\r\n<p>Following the first round of judging, the
  entries from up to 16 semifinalists will be made publicly available for online voting
  for approximately 30 days.</p>\r\n<p>The People's Choice Award winner will also
  be announced with the winners from each level on May 3, 2019. The People's Choice
  Award will not include a monetary prize but will include public recognition and
  promotion of the participants and their work on the NSF website and at other events
  and venues. The video will be showcased at the 2019 National Math Festival, but
  the winner will not be notified in advance, and therefore, no travel expenses will
  be covered for the winner to attend.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Post-Competition Use of Videos</strong></p>\r\n<p>All
  winning videos and a selection of other top entries will be showcased at the 2019
  National Math Festival, which is expected to draw a crowd of approximately 20,000
  people.</p>\r\n<p>Winning videos will appear on the NSF website and be promoted
  through social media.</p>\r\n<p>A selection of video entries may also be used by
  the NSF Office of Legislative and Public Affairs of other NSF offices, divisions,
  or directorates for future educational or promotional activities.</p>\r\n<h3>JUDGING
  CRITERIA</h3>\r\n<p>Two rounds of formal judging will determine winners of the prize
  money, and a period of public voting will determine the winner of a People's Choice
  Award. The People&rsquo;s Choice Award winner will not receive a monetary prize
  but will be showcased on the NSF website, through social media, and at public events.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1st
  Round of Judging</strong></p>\r\n<p>All entries will first be screened for compliance
  with the rules. All compliant videos will be scored by a panel of judges, using
  on the following four criteria:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Creativity (20%)</em>: Video
  is creatively used to showcase NSF-supported work in the mathematical sciences.</li>\r\n<li><em>Clarity
  and accuracy of mathematical concepts and ideas (20%)</em>: The mathematical concepts
  and ideas underlying the project are clearly and accurately illustrated throughout
  the video.</li>\r\n<li><em>Communicating mathematics in an accessible and exciting
  way (40%)</em>: NSF-supported project work is presented at a level and using language
  that can be understood by a broad audience of varying ages and mathematical backgrounds.
  Use of technical terminology and assumption of prior knowledge of the mathematical
  concepts in the video are limited. Video communicates project ideas, purpose, and/or
  impact in a way that excites the audience about the mathematical sciences. It has
  the potential to break down barriers for viewers who may perceive advanced studies
  and research in the mathematical sciences as inaccessible or have trouble envisioning
  themselves as future mathematical scientists.</li>\r\n<li><em>Artistic and technical
  quality (20%)</em>: Video has visual appeal, is refined, and has a high level of
  both visual and audio quality.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Judges will evaluate a collection
  of videos submitted to the same level. Based on the scoring, up to four semifinalists
  will be identified at each level.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2nd Round of Judging</strong></p>\r\n<p>Judges
  will review the semifinalists to determine one winning entry for each level. Round
  2 judges will not be able to see scores assigned in Round 1 and will score each
  semifinalist using the same four criteria used in Round 1. In cases where a judge
  is asked to review for both rounds, she/he will review videos at a different level
  for each round to ensure that they do not review the same videos twice.</p>\r\n<h3>FAQ</h3>\r\n<p><strong>When
  can I begin submitting my entry?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The contest will begin accepting
  entries on October 5, 2018. You can begin the submission process by registering
  at any time. Once you register, you will receive login details that will allow you
  to continue to access and complete your entry up until the submission deadline of
  February 28, 2019 at 11:59 PM EST.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Once I submit my video, can
  I revise it or replace it prior to the contest deadline?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Yes.
  You will continue to be able to access and edit your entry using the login details
  you receive at registration up until the submission deadline.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Do
  I have to be the PI or Fellow associated with the award to register?</strong></p>\r\n<p>No.
  Entries can be submitted by someone other than the PI or Fellow associated with
  the award number. These entries must include a signed PI Verification and Consent
  Form.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can more than one person or team submit videos for the same
  award number?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Yes. There is no limit on the number of videos
  that can be submitted for an award number, as long as any entries submitted by someone
  other than the PI or Fellow associated with the award include a PI Verification
  and Consent Form.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can I contribute to more than one entry?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Yes.
  You may contribute to multiple entries as a member of a team; however, you can only
  submit one entry as an individual or a team leader.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Do I have
  to be over 18 to enter?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Yes. While some projects showcased in
  video submissions may involve participants under the age of 18, only individuals
  who are 18 or older can register and submit entries.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What if my
  award has ended? Can I still submit a video on my work?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Yes.
  Videos can showcase work that is currently being supported or has previously been
  supported by NSF.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do I choose the appropriate submission level
  for my video?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The submission level should be determined by the
  level of the work that received NSF-support. For example, an advanced researcher
  working with a K-12 teacher on a project in the K-12 classroom, should submit to
  Level 1: K-12 and Undergraduate. A mid-career researcher submitting work completed
  as part of a Graduate Research Fellowship, should submit to Level 2: Graduate.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Do
  I really need to put the NSF logo and the NSF acknowledgement and disclaimer in
  the video?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Yes. The NSF logo must be included in the video. Official
  logo options can be accessed at <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/policies/logos.jsp\">https://www.nsf.gov/policies/logos.jsp</a>.
  Videos must also include the standard NSF acknowledgement of support and disclaimer.
  Language can be accessed here: <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg18_1/pappg_11.jsp#XIE4\">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg18_1/pappg_11.jsp#XIE4</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can
  I request an award supplement to help fund production of my video?</strong></p>\r\n<p>No.
  While video entries must showcase NSF-supported work, no additional funds will be
  provided by NSF for the creation of videos for this competition.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How
  will my video entry be submitted and in what form?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Videos must
  be uploaded to the competition platform. If possible, record in HD (i.e., 1280 x
  720).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Does the video have to include credits identifying the video
  creator and any volunteers?</strong></p>\r\n<p>No. While you may choose to include
  credits identifying the video creator or any volunteers, these are not required.
  Any identifying information included in the video will be reviewed, and judges will
  be required to notify the competition organizers of any conflicts of interest.</p>\r\n<p><strong>If
  I include credits on my video are they included in the 3-minute limit?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Yes.
  The entire video cannot exceed 3 minutes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How will semifinalists
  and winners be notified?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Semifinalists and winners will be notified
  via email sent to the individual or team leader. Winners will be notified prior
  to a public announcement of the results to make necessary arrangements for travel
  to Washington, DC for the National Math Festival on May 4, 2019. The winning videos
  will be showcased in a special session at the National Math Festival and with other
  NSF activities throughout the day.</p>\r\n<p><strong>If my team wins, do we all
  get to go to the National Math Festival?</strong></p>\r\n<p>All team members are
  welcome to attend; however, funding will only be provided for travel expenses for
  one team member to attend the National Math Festival.</p>\r\n<p><strong>If my team
  wins, how does the prize money get distributed among the team members?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Prize
  money for winning teams will be sent to the team leader. It will be up to the team
  to determine how the prize money is distributed among members of the team.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What
  is the prize for People&rsquo;s Choice Award?</strong></p>\r\n<p>While there is
  no monetary prize for the People&rsquo;s Choice Award winner, your video will be
  shared by NSF and promoted on a public website. It may also appear at a range of
  events, including those serving the general public, the academic community, government
  officials, and industry leaders.</p>\r\n<h3>CONTACT</h3>\r\n<p>For any questions
