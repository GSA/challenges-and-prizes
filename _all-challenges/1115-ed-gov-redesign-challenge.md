  To improve service to and communication with stakeholders and the general
  public, the Department of Education (“ED” or “Department”) plans to modernize
  its public facing website.  Accordingly, ED is seeking interactive prototypes
  for a redesign of ED.gov, the Department’s homepage.  


  The Department is not seeking a run-of-the-mill refresh but rather a creative redesign that maximizes user experience and proposes new innovations in layout, typography, animation, illustration, video and photography, and other modern advances.


  #### **NEW! [Submission Form](<{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/netlify-uploads/challenge-appl.pdf>) and [Frequently Asked Questions](<{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/netlify-uploads/redesign-faqs.pdf>)**


  *About the Department of Education*


  ED is the agency of the federal government that establishes policy for, administers, and coordinates most federal assistance to education. The Department assists the president in executing his education policies for the nation and in implementing laws enacted by Congress. ED's mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.


  Although ED is a relative newcomer among Cabinet-level agencies, its origins go back to 1867, when President Andrew Johnson signed legislation creating the first Department of Education. Its main purpose was to collect information and statistics about the nation's schools. However, due to concern that ED would exercise too much control over local schools, the new Department was demoted to an Office of Education in 1868.


  Over the years, the office remained relatively small, operating under different titles and housed in various agencies, including the U.S. Department of the Interior and the former U.S. Department of Health Education and Welfare (now Health and Human Services).


  *The Current State of ED.gov*


  To achieve its goals and further its mission, ED maintains open communication with the general public, especially those seeking information on behalf of their states, districts, schools, and children. That’s why the organization must keep pace with the way 21st century Americans learn, engage, and interact. With 312 million internet users in the United States alone – and 90 percent of American adults reporting using the internet “[at least occasionally](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276445/number-of-internet-users-in-the-united-states/)”  – it is essential to maintain a strong web presence. A key component of that effort is redesigning ED’s website.


  ED.gov is the Department’s main public-facing website, with nearly 15 million users accessing the site in 2019. These users represented:  students and parents; press; educators and administrators; state and local officials; non-profit stakeholders; representatives from community organizations; and advocates, among others. The site’s most-visited pages included information about student loan and grant programs, and laws – like the Freedom of Information Act and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.


  The Department’s web presence includes several subdomains: www.ED.gov, www2.ed.gov, blog.ed.gov, and sites.ed.gov. ED.gov is managed with the open-source Drupal, WordPress and TeamSite content management systems (CMS) and is hosted externally in a cloud environment.


  *Limitations and Challenges of Current Design*


  Nearly 40 percent of people will stop engaging with a website if the design is [unattractive](https://blogs.adobe.com/creative/files/2015/12/Adobe-State-of-Content-Report.pdf), and nearly half of users cite design as the number one factor in assessing [credibility](https://www.bluecorona.com/blog/20-web-design-facts-small-business-owners/). Design plays a critical role in ensuring the public has access to, and engages with, the content on ED.gov.


  The last large-scale update of ED.gov occurred in 2015. At that time, ED analyzed available data to determine what pages most users were accessing and redesigned the homepage to fit the public’s evolving needs. This redesign reduced the number of homepage links and created more open space, so the page became more easily navigable to the end user. The update also meant that the entire flagship site offered a mobile-friendly experience, with all content layouts using responsive design. 


  While the update included several important changes, the design fell short in key areas. Customers find it challenging to quickly locate information that meets their needs. The current site: 


  * Remains difficult to navigate;

  * Does not incorporate the latest functionality that enhances the user experience;

  * Relies too heavily on text;

  * Is antiquated; and

  * Does not have a consistent brand, look, or feel.


  *Goals for a Redesigned ED.gov*


  The goal for this Challenge is to improve the overall quality of the design, navigation, interactivity, and presentation of ED.gov.  


  **The challenge is for design prototypes only.** The design prototypes received will be used to inform the development of requirements for a future acquisition for the rebuild of ED.gov. This challenge is not intended to lead to a follow-on acquisition but rather is a form of market research. Still, applicants are allowed to compete for the implementation contract following the prototype submission, even if their submission was not chosen for the redesign challenge. The two processes are independent of each other (see more details below).  


  ED’s website is a content and information hub. Redesign innovators should focus on that foundation.  In the improved design, ED.gov should have: 


  * Accessible content for desktop, mobile, and tablet users;

  * Integrated social media, RSS feeds, and subscription services;

  * Elegant, clean, simple, user-centered look and feel with a modern aesthetic;

  * Strong ED branding on the homepage, and throughout the entire site with a consistent appearance;

  * New and innovative tools that enhance user experience; and

  * Engaging and easy-to-navigate pages.


  *Performance Objectives* 


  The redesign of ED.gov should engage the American public, amplify the Secretary’s message, and advance ED’s policy goals, while maintaining high availability and high performance.  


  Innovators should ensure to the greatest extent practicable that any design supports the federally mandated [21st Century Idea Act](https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ336/PLAW-115publ336.pdf) for modernization, including complying with the following: 


  * Be accessible to individuals with disabilities by applying section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

  * Uses the [US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) maturity model to create and implement the site.

  * Have a consistent appearance.

  * Contain a search function intended for public use.

  * Be provided through an industry-standard, secure connection.

  * Be fully functional and usable on common mobile devices.


  *Key Parameters* 


  In redesigning ED.gov, Challenge participants should focus on six (6) key templates: 


  1. Homepage (<http://www.ed.gov>);

  2. Program office page (<https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/om/fs_po/ocr/home.html?src=oc>)

  3. Informational page (<https://www2.ed.gov/fund/grants-college.html?src=pn>);

  4. Grant page (<https://www2.ed.gov/programs/fws/index.html>);

  5. Contact page (<https://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/gen/index.html?src=ft>); and

  6. News page (<http://www.ed.gov/news>). 


  The prototype must also comply with the following directives:


  * New designs should conform with ED’s existing color scheme and use its current seal.

  * New designs must not use proprietary software or operating systems unless necessary. 

  * The site should use either the Drupal and/or WordPress open-source CMS for web or content creation and for managing information or content on a webpage.


  Prototypes may incorporate text and content already available on the website, or dummy text.


  *Deliverables*


  To meet the need of this challenge, participants should provide a link to an interactive prototype of an ED.gov redesign for the above six pages.  In addition, participants should provide back-up documentation for the prototype that includes:


  * Wireframes that present the site layout and navigation.

  * Mock-ups that include the layout and navigation from the wireframes but with brand and site colors, logo, images, content blocks, typography, etc.

  * Other information such as open-source CMS used, development language(s), browser(s) supported, mobile compatibility, screen resolutions (including responsive for mobile), operating systems, assistive technologies, text sizing, etc.

### Description

To improve service to and communication with stakeholders and the general public, the Department of Education (“ED” or “Department”) plans to modernize its public facing website.  Accordingly, ED is seeking interactive prototypes for a redesign of ED.gov, the Department’s homepage.  

The Department is not seeking a run-of-the-mill refresh but rather a creative redesign that maximizes user experience and proposes new innovations in layout, typography, animation, illustration, video and photography, and other modern advances.

#### **NEW! [Submission Form](<{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/netlify-uploads/challenge-appl.pdf>) and [Frequently Asked Questions](<{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/netlify-uploads/redesign-faqs.pdf>)**

*About the Department of Education*

ED is the agency of the federal government that establishes policy for, administers, and coordinates most federal assistance to education. The Department assists the president in executing his education policies for the nation and in implementing laws enacted by Congress. ED's mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.

Although ED is a relative newcomer among Cabinet-level agencies, its origins go back to 1867, when President Andrew Johnson signed legislation creating the first Department of Education. Its main purpose was to collect information and statistics about the nation's schools. However, due to concern that ED would exercise too much control over local schools, the new Department was demoted to an Office of Education in 1868.

Over the years, the office remained relatively small, operating under different titles and housed in various agencies, including the U.S. Department of the Interior and the former U.S. Department of Health Education and Welfare (now Health and Human Services).

*The Current State of ED.gov*

To achieve its goals and further its mission, ED maintains open communication with the general public, especially those seeking information on behalf of their states, districts, schools, and children. That’s why the organization must keep pace with the way 21st century Americans learn, engage, and interact. With 312 million internet users in the United States alone – and 90 percent of American adults reporting using the internet “[at least occasionally](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276445/number-of-internet-users-in-the-united-states/)”  – it is essential to maintain a strong web presence. A key component of that effort is redesigning ED’s website.

ED.gov is the Department’s main public-facing website, with nearly 15 million users accessing the site in 2019. These users represented:  students and parents; press; educators and administrators; state and local officials; non-profit stakeholders; representatives from community organizations; and advocates, among others. The site’s most-visited pages included information about student loan and grant programs, and laws – like the Freedom of Information Act and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

The Department’s web presence includes several subdomains: www.ED.gov, www2.ed.gov, blog.ed.gov, and sites.ed.gov. ED.gov is managed with the open-source Drupal, WordPress and TeamSite content management systems (CMS) and is hosted externally in a cloud environment.

*Limitations and Challenges of Current Design*

Nearly 40 percent of people will stop engaging with a website if the design is [unattractive](https://blogs.adobe.com/creative/files/2015/12/Adobe-State-of-Content-Report.pdf), and nearly half of users cite design as the number one factor in assessing [credibility](https://www.bluecorona.com/blog/20-web-design-facts-small-business-owners/). Design plays a critical role in ensuring the public has access to, and engages with, the content on ED.gov.

The last large-scale update of ED.gov occurred in 2015. At that time, ED analyzed available data to determine what pages most users were accessing and redesigned the homepage to fit the public’s evolving needs. This redesign reduced the number of homepage links and created more open space, so the page became more easily navigable to the end user. The update also meant that the entire flagship site offered a mobile-friendly experience, with all content layouts using responsive design. 

While the update included several important changes, the design fell short in key areas. Customers find it challenging to quickly locate information that meets their needs. The current site: 

* Remains difficult to navigate;
* Does not incorporate the latest functionality that enhances the user experience;
* Relies too heavily on text;
* Is antiquated; and
* Does not have a consistent brand, look, or feel.

*Goals for a Redesigned ED.gov*

The goal for this Challenge is to improve the overall quality of the design, navigation, interactivity, and presentation of ED.gov.  

**The challenge is for design prototypes only.** The design prototypes received will be used to inform the development of requirements for a future acquisition for the rebuild of ED.gov. This challenge is not intended to lead to a follow-on acquisition but rather is a form of market research. Still, applicants are allowed to compete for the implementation contract following the prototype submission, even if their submission was not chosen for the redesign challenge. The two processes are independent of each other (see more details below).  

ED’s website is a content and information hub. Redesign innovators should focus on that foundation.  In the improved design, ED.gov should have: 

* Accessible content for desktop, mobile, and tablet users;
* Integrated social media, RSS feeds, and subscription services;
* Elegant, clean, simple, user-centered look and feel with a modern aesthetic;
* Strong ED branding on the homepage, and throughout the entire site with a consistent appearance;
* New and innovative tools that enhance user experience; and
* Engaging and easy-to-navigate pages.

*Performance Objectives* 

The redesign of ED.gov should engage the American public, amplify the Secretary’s message, and advance ED’s policy goals, while maintaining high availability and high performance.  

Innovators should ensure to the greatest extent practicable that any design supports the federally mandated [21st Century Idea Act](https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ336/PLAW-115publ336.pdf) for modernization, including complying with the following: 

* Be accessible to individuals with disabilities by applying section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
* Uses the [US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) maturity model to create and implement the site.
* Have a consistent appearance.
* Contain a search function intended for public use.
* Be provided through an industry-standard, secure connection.
* Be fully functional and usable on common mobile devices.

*Key Parameters* 

In redesigning ED.gov, Challenge participants should focus on six (6) key templates: 

1. Homepage (<http://www.ed.gov>);
2. Program office page (<https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/om/fs_po/ocr/home.html?src=oc>)
3. Informational page (<https://www2.ed.gov/fund/grants-college.html?src=pn>);
4. Grant page (<https://www2.ed.gov/programs/fws/index.html>);
5. Contact page (<https://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/gen/index.html?src=ft>); and
6. News page (<http://www.ed.gov/news>). 

The prototype must also comply with the following directives:

* New designs should conform with ED’s existing color scheme and use its current seal.
* New designs must not use proprietary software or operating systems unless necessary. 
* The site should use either the Drupal and/or WordPress open-source CMS for web or content creation and for managing information or content on a webpage.

Prototypes may incorporate text and content already available on the website, or dummy text.

*Deliverables*

To meet the need of this challenge, participants should provide a link to an interactive prototype of an ED.gov redesign for the above six pages.  In addition, participants should provide back-up documentation for the prototype that includes:

* Wireframes that present the site layout and navigation.
* Mock-ups that include the layout and navigation from the wireframes but with brand and site colors, logo, images, content blocks, typography, etc.
* Other information such as open-source CMS used, development language(s), browser(s) supported, mobile compatibility, screen resolutions (including responsive for mobile), operating systems, assistive technologies, text sizing, etc.

  ### Prizes

  The Department of Education is offering a total prize pot of up to $50,000. The entirety of the prize may go to one winner or may be split between multiple winners, if the panel determines multiple winners are warranted. Up to three prize winners may be selected from the submissions, including a Grand Prize, a Runner Up, and an Honorable Mention.

  At the Department’s discretion, to assist with selecting winners, one or more of the most highly rated challenge participants may be invited to present a live demonstration of their ED.gov redesign prototype before agency subject matter experts, including Office of the Chief Information Officer staff, website owners, or segment owners. 

  Any potential prizes awarded under this Challenge will be paid by electronic funds transfer.  Winners will be required to complete and return an Automated Clearing House (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment Enrollment Form to ED within a given timeframe. The form collects banking information needed to make an electronic payment (direct deposit) to the winner. Award recipients will be responsible for any applicable local, state, and federal taxes and reporting that may be required under applicable tax laws.

  **Reviewer Conflict of Interest**

  Prior to the start of the judging, all submissions will be reviewed to ensure no reviewer will have a conflict of interest with any submission he/she will be reviewing. Reviewers in this challenge may not review a submission in which they (a) have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of any entity that is a registered participant in the Prize challenge; or (b) have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a registered participant.

  **Review**

  ED will screen all completed submissions to determine compliance with submission criteria and assign reviewers to independently score the content of each qualified submission. The reviewers will be composed of ED subject matter experts with expertise in relevant website and web design areas. The size of the review panel will be based on the number of entrants.  As needed, after preliminary consideration of all submissions for suitability in terms of innovation, quality of redesign and compliance with federal web standards, ED will eliminate those not meeting these standards in order to determine compliance with submission criteria. Reviewers will offer input scores on those submissions passing the initial review.  Reviewers will rate submissions using the judging criteria above and make non-consensus forming recommendations as to which finalists should be selected as winners. ED will make final selection determinations. One or more concepts will be selected as winners. Up to three prize winners may be selected from the submissions, including a Grand Prize, a Runner Up, and an Honorable Mention.

  By participating in the Challenge, each entrant acknowledges and agrees that such recommendations of the reviewers based on the criteria may differ and agrees to be bound by, and not to challenge, the final decisions of the Department.
