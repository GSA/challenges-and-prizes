  this Challenge, Challenge participants may access the registration on the Challenge
  website (<a href="https://www.synapse.org/upforachallenge">https://www.synapse.org/upforachallenge</a>). 
  Access to this website may also be found by searching the <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">www.challenge.gov</a>
  site for “Up For A Challenge.”  Individuals may participate in the Challenge as
  individuals or as Teams.  Details about participating as a Team are provided below:  <ol>   <li>After
  registration, you may participate alone or on a Team with other Challenge participants.
  To work on a Team, you may either create a new Team or join a pre-existing Team.</li>   <li>There
  is no maximum Team size.</li>   <li>All Teams must designate a Team Captain. Each
  individual member of a Team must be a registered participant in the Challenge.</li>   <li>Individuals
  may participate on multiple Teams, and Challenge Teams may merge (requiring mutual
  agreement of Team Captains). Individuals are allowed to leave a Team to work alone
  or join another Team.</li>  </ol>  Data Access Process    Once registered for the
  Challenge, participants must apply for controlled access to the designated Challenge
  genetic datasets following instructions on the Challenge website.  Challenge participants
  may use any of these dbGaP datasets or any other datasets available to anyone (either
  publically available or available through controlled access) such as data from the
  Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (<a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">http://cancergenome.nih.gov/</a>)
  or the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project (<a href="http://www.genome.gov/encode/">http://www.genome.gov/encode/</a>).    Data
  will be requested through database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) application
  process.  Details regarding the process for requesting data are provided on the
  Challenge website (<a href="https://www.synapse.org/upforachallenge">https://www.synapse.org/upforachallenge</a>). 
  Data Access Requests will be reviewed by the appropriate NIH Data Access Committees
  (DAC) to ensure that the proposed project is consistent with any Data Use Limitations
  for the requested dataset(s). NOTE: that any scientific collaborators, including
  contractors, who are not at the same institution as the PI must submit their own
  DAR. Data cannot be shared with collaborators from other institutions until they
  have submitted an application (and explicitly named this collaborators) to use the
  dataset(s) from their institution(s) and have received approval. If Approved Users
  are provided access to NIH genomic datasets for inter-institutional collaborative
  research described in the research use statement of the DAR, and all members of
  the collaboration are also Approved Users through their home institution(s), data
  obtained through this DAR may be securely transmitted within the collaborative group.    Challenge
  participants who obtain data from dbGaP should note that they are agreeing to the
  NIH Genomic Data User Code of Conduct (<a href="http://gds.nih.gov/pdf/Genomic_Data_User_Code_of_Conduct.pdf">http://gds.nih.gov/pdf/Genomic_Data_User_Code_of_Conduct.pdf</a>)
  and they are agreeing to the terms of specific Data Use Certificates for each individual
  dataset requested (The model Data Use Certificate can be found here -- <a href="http://gds.nih.gov/pdf/Model_DUC.pdf">http://gds.nih.gov/pdf/Model_DUC.pdf</a>). 
  Note that individual datasets may have additional limitations in regards to use
  of the data.  As the GWAS datasets obtained from dbGaP are considered controlled
  access data, individuals approved to use these data must abide by dbGaP security
  best practices in regards to the data (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/pdf/dbgap_2b_security_procedures.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/pdf/dbgap_2b_security_procedures.pdf</a>).    If
  submitting a request to dbGaP for use of data for the Challenge, participants should
  be aware that the data requested should be used solely for the research purpose
  described in the Data Access Request, i.e. solely for the Challenge. New uses of
  these data outside this Challenge will require submission of a new Data Access Request.    Challenge

judging-criteria-description-0: '<p>1. Identification of Novel Findings (25 points)
  – Using breast cancer GWAS data sets available in dbGaP and/or any          other
  publicly available data sets, Challenge participants must identify new genes
  or combinations of genes,          genetic variants, or sets of genomic features
  associated with breast cancer susceptibility.        a. The National Human Genome
  Research Institute’s (NHGRI) Catalog of Published Genome Wide Association          Studies
  (http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/) or variants/loci identified in the following
  publications can be used            to evaluate possible novel findings:             i.
  Mavaddat et al., 2010, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20542480;             ii.
  Ghoussani et al., 2013, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23973388;             iii.
  Fachal and Dunning, 2015, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25727315)      b.
  The scale for novelty for the Challenge Evaluation panel to use as a guide is
  provided:            i. New variants in well-established high or moderate penetrance
  genes                    (e.g., BRCA1/BRCA2; ATM; PALB2)        (low)             ii.
  New variants in GWAS-identified genes or loci (med)             iii. New combinations
  of variants which were previously identified                    (i.e., the combination
  or combined effect is     new, but the variants were previously identified)
  (medium)            iv. New genes or loci (high)            v. New combinations
  of variants from genes or loci not identified previously                    (i.e.,
  the combination and some of the variants are new) (high)</p>  <p>2. Replication of
  Findings (25 points) – Evidence of the validity of the proposed novel finding
  will be evaluated           through replication.      a. There are several different
  ways replication can be accomplished. These may include using data sets as testing          and
  training data (or discovery in one data set and replication in another data
  set) or dividing the data into several          portions and performing some
  type of cross-validation.  The Challenge Evaluation panel will also be open
  to other          innovative approaches for replication.              i. The
  Challenge participant will need to select criteria for replication and provide
  a justification for the selected                  criteria.  Using the criteria
  selected by the Challenge participant, the Challenge participant must demonstrate                  replication
  of findings.       b. NOTE: Challenge participants should provide their criteria
  for replication in the narrative portion of their                  Challenge
  Entry.         c. The adequacy of criteria selected by the Challenge participant
  and evidence for replication will be scored by the           Challenge Evaluation
  Panel.</p>   <p>3. Innovation of Approach (25 points) – Innovation and creativity of
  the submitted approach will be evaluated.          Innovation will be defined
  as a new or significantly improved method.  The submitted narrative must describe          what
  is innovative about the approach, what this approach is building on, and why
  the approach is necessary or          how it improves upon existing approaches.  Some
  criteria for innovation include the following:       a. Does the Entry seek
  to shift current paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches,
  or           methodologies?       b. Are the concepts, approaches, or methods
  in the Entry novel to this field of research or novel in a broader sense?       c.
  Does the Entry represent a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical
  concepts, approaches, or           methodologies?</p>  <p>4. Evidence of Novel Biological
  Hypothesis(es) (10 points) –       a. Evaluation of this aspect of Challenge
  Entries will be based on whether findings (i.e., new genes or combinations           of
  genes, genetic variants, or sets of genomic features) lead to novel biological
  hypotheses.  A description of            these hypotheses should be provided
  in the final project Entry.       b. Novel biological hypotheses should be testable,
  either using computational or laboratory approaches.  Evaluation           will
  be based on the narrative description of the design of testable experiments,
  which could examine the novel           biological hypothesis identified through
  these new genes or combinations of genes, genetic variants, or sets of           genomic
  features associated with breast cancer.  The format should mirror an outline
  of grant-specific aims.    NOTE: The “Evidence of Novel Biological Hypothesis(es)”
  criteria (4) is distinct from the “Identification of Novel Findings” criteria
  (1).  The “Evidence of Novel Biological Hypothesis(es)” criteria (4) is based
  on the narrative description of hypotheses generated from the findings and proposed
  follow up experiments.  In contrast, the “Identification of Novel Findings”
  criteria (1) are the identification of new genes or combinations of genes, genetic
  variants, or sets of genomic features associated with breast cancer susceptibility.</p>    <p>5.
  Collaboration (15 points) – Points will be awarded based on (a) the number of
  different fields represented on the          Team; (b) the number of new collaborations
  represented on the Team (defined as individuals not having           published
  together in the past 5 years); and (c) the number of individuals invited to
  participate in the Challenge by           Team members resulting in Entries
  to the Challenge</p>'
judging-criteria-percentage-0: '100'
judging-criteria-0: Entries will be scored by the Challenge Evaluation Panel using
  the criteria listed below. After the Challenge Evaluation Panel provides final
  scores, the highest scoring applications will be evaluated for reproducibility
  by Sage Bionetworks’ data scientists.   In order to qualify for a Challenge
  prize, it must be possible for Sage Bionetworks’ data scientists to reproduce
  Entry results within 1 month.  The NCI Judges will review scores and reproduction
  by Sage and make recommendations to the NCI Director.  The NCI Director will
  make the final selection of Entries for award.

description: <p>The National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute’s (NCI)
  Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) announces that they are
  partnering with Sage Bionetworks to launch “Up For A Challenge (U4C) – Stimulating
  Innovation in Breast Cancer Genetic Epidemiology” (the “Challenge”) to encourage
  unique approaches to more fully decipher the genomic basis of breast cancer. 
  Utilizing innovative approaches, the goal of this Challenge is to identify new genes or combinations
  of genes, genetic variants, or sets of genomic features involved in breast cancer
  susceptibility. In addition, the NCI aims to advance innovation in the field of
  genetic epidemiology by making data more widely available, increasing the amount
  and diversity of minds approaching a difficult scientific problem, and promoting
  broader collaborations.</p>    <p>In order to stimulate innovation, the National Cancer
  Institute’s (NCI) Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) is
  launching a prize competition to inspire novel cross-disciplinary approaches to
  more fully decipher the genomic basis of breast cancer, called “Up For A Challenge
  (U4C) – Stimulating Innovation in Breast Cancer Genetic Epidemiology” (the “Challenge”)
  using the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology,
  Education, and Science (COMPETES) Reauthorization Act of 2010.</p>    <p>The goal of this
  Challenge is to use innovative approaches to identify novel pathways—including new
  genes or combinations of genes, genetic variants, or sets of genomic features—involved
  in breast cancer susceptibility in order to generate new biological hypotheses.    To
  that end, several data sets have been gathered and will be made available for use
  in the Challenge; some of these will be released for the first time. In addition,
  Challenge participants will be free to use any other publicly available data sets
  (subject to compliance with applicable terms and conditions) for the purposes of
  developing and applying methods for identification of the novel pathways.</p>    <p>Breast
  cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer, and the second most common cause of
  cancer deaths in women in the United States.  An estimated 231,840 new cases of
  invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed among women (2,350 in men) in
  the U.S. during 2015 with an estimated 40,730 deaths. Despite advances in breast
  cancer therapies, breast cancer remains a major public health burden. One approach
  to reduce overall occurrence and mortality from breast cancer is to develop ways
  of identifying women who are at increased risk for breast cancer.</p>    <p>Epidemiologic
  studies suggest that genetic factors play a key role in determining who is at increased
  risk of developing breast cancer, as well as what type of cancer they develop.  To
  date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have helped researchers identify more
  than 90 common genetic variations. Although GWAS have greatly increased our understanding
  of the genetic components of breast cancer susceptibility, the results to date explain
  only a small proportion of the estimated genetic contribution to the risk of breast
  cancer. However, shifting the focus of analysis from individual genetic variants
  (also known as single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) to pathways (i.e. combinations
  of genes, genetic variants, or sets of genomic features), could lead to the identification
  of novel gene sets involved in breast cancer risk.</p>    <p>This Challenge provides an
  opportunity to examine the heritable contribution to racial disparities, by facilitating
  access to GWAS data sets from African American, Asian, European, and Latino women. 
  African American women are known to have a lower incidence of breast cancer, but
  survival is lower for African American than for non-Hispanic white women at every
  stage of diagnosis. Meanwhile, Asian women have the lowest rates of breast cancer
  incidence and mortality compared with non-Hispanic white, African American, and
  Hispanic/Latino women.  Findings from this Challenge may provide insights into some
  of these observed differences.</p>    <p>As more fully described below, participants are
  invited to use innovative approaches to identify novel pathways—including new genes
  or combinations of genes, genetic variants, or sets of genomic features—involved
  in breast cancer susceptibility. Besides developing a better understanding of cancer
  risk assessment, the identification of breast cancer susceptibility genes holds
  promise for providing therapeutic targets for drug development.</p>
