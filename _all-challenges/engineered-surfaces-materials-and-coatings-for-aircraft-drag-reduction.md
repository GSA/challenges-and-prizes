description: The Ohio Aerospace Institute (OAI) and its Engineered Surfaces, Materials
  and Coatings (ESMC) Team, under contract with the Air Force Research Laboratory
  (AFRL), is soliciting innovative cost effective ways to reduce drag on legacy Air
  Force aircraft. The Seeker is primarily searching for existing technologies or research
  studies, outside of the aircraft industry, that provide surface friction reduction
  in fluid mediums and have potential to be translated to the aircraft industry for
  skin friction reduction. Other sources of aircraft drag reduction are sought as
  well. Areas of particular interest include discovery of new materials or application
  processes to create engineered surfaces with drag effect of modifying streamwise
  airflow (e.g. riblets), or coatings to reduce skin friction drag.  These surfaces
  must be able to survive the environmental extremes of normal transport aircraft
  flight regimes. These Engineered Surfaces, Materials and Coatings (ESMC) should
  nominally last for several years and be easily applied to an existing aircraft to
  accomplish a reasonable Return on Investment (ROI) for applying to legacy transport
  aircraft.    <em>This Challenge requires only a written proposal</em>
