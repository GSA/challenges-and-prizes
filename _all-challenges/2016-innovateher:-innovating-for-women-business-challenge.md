rules: '<strong><u>Subject of Challenge</u>:</strong> The SBA is looking for innovative
  products and services that help impact and empower the lives of women and families.
  Contestants must develop a product or service that meets the following three
  Challenge criteria:  <ul>   <li>Has a measurable impact on the lives of women
  and families (30%);</li>   <li>Has the potential for commercialization (40%);
  and</li>   <li>Fills a need in the marketplace (30%)</li>  </ul>  <ol start="2">   <li><strong><u>Eligibility
  Rules for Participating in the Challenge</u></strong>: This Challenge is open
  only to: (1) citizens or permanent residents of the United States who are at
  least eighteen (18) years of age at the time of their submission of an entry
  (or teams of such individuals); and (2) private entities, such as corporations
  or other organizations, that are incorporated in and maintain a primary place
  of business in the United States. Individuals submitting on behalf of corporations,
  nonprofits, or groups of individuals (such as an academic class or other team)
  must meet the eligibility requirements for individual contestants. An individual
  may belong to more than one team submitting an entry in this Challenge. SBA
  employees are not eligible, nor are Federal entities or Federal employees acting
  within the scope of their employment. Individuals or organizations that are
  currently suspended or disbarred by the federal government are not eligible
  for this Challenge.</li>   <li><strong><u>Registration Process for Participants</u></strong>:
  The Challenge launches on August 4, 2015. The initial round of the Challenge
  will take the form of local competitions that will be run across the country
  beginning no earlier than August 5, 2015 and ending no later than December 2,
  2015 by host organizations such as universities, accelerators, clusters, scale-up
  communities, SBA Resource Partners, and Microsoft stores. For more information
  regarding these local competitions as it becomes available, please visit <a
  href="https://www.sba.gov/offices/headquarters/wbo/resources/1465581">sba.gov/InnovateHER</a>.
  SBA will continue to update the list of local competitions as details are confirmed.
  While these local competitions will be identified as part of the national InnovateHER
  Challenge and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with these Challenge
  Rules, they will be administered solely by the local host organizations and
  will be judged by individuals selected by each host in their sole discretion.
  At a minimum, however, each application must contain a business plan covering
  the contestant’s proposed product or service and must satisfy the Challenge
  criteria identified by SBA in Paragraph 1 above.</li>  </ol>  Following the
  completion of the local competitions, each host organization will identify one
  winner that will advance to the semi-final round of the Challenge. For a winning
  entry that has been submitted by a team of competitors, the host organization
  must list the team’s self-identified project leader as the winner who will advance
  to the semi-final round. No later than December 3, 2015, each host organization
  will submit a nomination package to <a href="http://www.challenge.gov/">www.Challenge.gov</a>
  containing the winning individual/team’s business plan and other required information
  to SBA, which will administer the semi-final and final rounds of the Challenge.
  Selection as a semi-finalist following a local competition is the only means
  of registering for the Challenge. All nominations will be screened by SBA for
  eligibility. Contestants cannot submit entries directly to SBA.  <ol start="4">   <li><strong><u>Prize
  for Winners</u></strong>: Cash prizes totaling $70,000 will be awarded to the
  three highest-rated contestants in the final round of the Challenge in the following
  amounts:</li>  </ol>  <ul>   <li>1st Place - $40,000</li>   <li>2nd Place -
  $20,000</li>   <li>3rd Place - $10,000</li>  </ul>  For winning entries submitted
  by teams of competitors, prize money will be awarded to the self-identified
  project leader for distribution to the rest of the team at their discretion
  and independently from SBA.  <ol start="5">   <li><strong><u>Process for Host
  Organizations</u></strong><u>:</u>  Each host organization will determine the
  type of local competition, conducted in a manner that is consistent with these
  Challenge Rules, that will best identify the most innovative and entrepreneurial
  business ideas, including the type of application that individuals need to prepare
  in order to compete. At a minimum, however, each application must contain a
  business plan covering the contestant’s proposed product or service and must
  satisfy the Challenge criteria identified by SBA in Paragraph 1 above. The local
  competitions will be administered solely by the local host organizations and
  will be judged by individuals selected by each host in their sole discretion.
  <strong> However, no individual acting as a judge at any stage of this Challenge
  may have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director,
  or agent of any contestant or have a familial or financial relationship with
  a contestant. </strong>Host organizations will also publicize the competition
  locally. Host organizations should notify SBA of the date and location of the
  local competitions for the purposes of publication at <a href="http://www.sba.gov/InnovateHER">www.sba.gov/InnovateHER</a>.</li>  </ol>  <ul>   <li><strong>Semi-Final
