rules: '<p>The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) announces an open source prize competition
  that challenges the public to create and improve an innovative robocall honeypot.
  A honeypot is an information system that is designed to attract perpetrators
  of illegal acts—in this case robocallers—and gain knowledge about their tactics.
  The Contest will be held at DEF CON 22, a conference of information security
  specialists, in Las Vegas, Nevada, from August 7-10, 2014.</p><p>The Contest will
  occur in 3 independent phases, with Winner(s) chosen from each phase. Phase
  1, “Creator,” involves building a robocall honeypot. Phase 2, “Attacker,” requires
  Contestants to identify a honeypot’s security vulnerabilities. Phase 3, “Detective,”
  involves analysis of data from an existing robocall honeypot.</p><p><article class="node-568801

  FTC Robocall Contest (the “Contest”) will complement the Federal Trade Commission’s
  2012 Robocall Challenge and advance its work, along with that of its public
  and private sector partners, to combat illegal telemarketing calls. Telemarketing
  robocalls are prerecorded messages that generally seek to promote the purchase
  of goods or services to a consumer, and are regulated by the FTC under the Telemarketing
  Sales Rule. See 16 CFR 310.4(b)(1)(v). Most such calls are illegal,<a id="_ftnref1"
  title="" href="https://www.ftc.gov/zapping-rachel/rules#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>
  and yet they continue to be prevalent.    The FTC is hosting a Robocall Contest
  at DEF CON 22. This contest will challenge the public to contribute to the design
  of robocall honeypots - information systems intended to attract perpetrators
  of illegal robocalls and gather knowledge about robocaller tactics. The Robocall
  Contest is intended to engage individuals or teams of individuals with information
  security expertise (collectively “Contestants”) to apply their knowledge to
  design the next-generation of robocall honeypots.    The Contest is subject
  to all applicable laws and regulations. Participation constitutes Contestant’s
  full agreement to these Official Rules and to decisions of the Sponsor (as defined
  below), which are final and binding in all matters related to the Contest. Winning
  a Prize is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements set forth in the Official
  Rules.  <h2><strong>1.  Sponsor and Participating Organizations</strong></h2>  <p>A.

  Rachel” booth at DEF CON 22.    C.  Contestants should register as soon as possible
  and will thereupon receive important information regarding each phase of the
  Contest in which they intend to participate, such as Twilio free credit for
  phases 1 and 2, or access to necessary data for phase 3. See Sections 7-9. 
  Contestants must submit their Registration Forms before the Submission Deadline
  of the first phase in which they are participating.    D.  After a Contestant
  registers, the Sponsor will send a confirmation message from <a class="mailto"
  href="mailto:RobocallContest@ftc.gov">RobocallContest@ftc.gov<span class="mailto"><span
  class="element-invisible"> (link sends e-mail)</span></span></a> to the email
  address provided by the Contestant. The Contestant should use the confirmation
  message to verify the email address, in order to indicate agreement to participate
  in the Contest and receive important Contest updates.    E.  In the event of
  a dispute pertaining to this Contest, the authorized account holder of the email
  address listed at registration will be deemed to be the Contestant. The “authorized
  account holder” is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet
  access provider, online service provider, or other organization responsible
  for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address.
  Contestants may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder.    F.
   Contestants must be physically present at the site of the Contest in order
  to participate. Individuals who wish to participate in the Contest without paying
  for entry to DEF CON 22 must send an email to <a class="mailto" href="mailto:RobocallContest@ftc.gov">RobocallContest@ftc.gov<span
  class="mailto"><span class="element-invisible"> (link sends e-mail)</span></span></a>
  indicating this preference on or before July 31, 2014. Such individuals may
  be escorted to the “Zapping Rachel” booth as the Sponsor deems necessary, but
  will not be able to attend any other events, contests, presentations, or otherwise
  participate in DEF CON 22.  <h2><strong>4.  Submission </strong></h2>  A.  To
  participate in any phase of the Contest, a Contestant must submit the following
  via electronic mail:    <br>(i)  the name of the solution;    <br>(ii)  solution source
  code;    <br>(iii)  a written description (as required for the specific phase);
  and    <br>(iv)  any other materials required under Sections 7-9 below, including
  access to relevant call detail records, dialing platforms, and/or other technologies
  needed to test the Submission.    Paragraphs <br>(i)-<br>(iv) above are collectively
  a “Submission.” The email address used to submit the Submission shall match
  the address provided on a Contestant’s Registration Form. With the exception
  of this originating email address, no part of the Submission shall contain information
  revealing the Contestant’s identity, such as a name, address, employment information,
  or other identifying details.    B.  Submission Deadlines    <br>(i) For phase 1,
  Contestants must enter their Submissions by August 8, 2014 at 12:00 pm (PDT).    <br>(ii)
  For phase 2, Contestants must enter their Submissions by August 9, 2014 at 12:00
  pm (PDT).    <br>(iii) For phase 3, Contestants must enter their Submissions by
  August 9, 2014 at 7:00 pm (PDT).    Paragraphs <br>(i)-<br>(iii) above are collectively
  the “Contest Deadlines.” The Sponsor’s computer is the official time-keeping
  device for this Contest. Any Submissions entered following the respective Contest
  Deadlines shall be disqualified. The Judging Period for each phase will commence
  immediately following the deadline for each phase. The Sponsor may limit the
  number of Contestants who can participate in each phase to ensure that the Judges
  have sufficient time to review the Submissions.    C.  Submission Requirements    <br>(i)
   The name, source code, written description, and any other materials should
  all be submitted at the same time. All Submissions must be received by the Contest
  Deadline for each phase.    <br>(ii)  Source code must be compatible with languages

  indicate when entering a Submission.    (v)  With the exception of source code,
  Submissions must be in English, except that textual material in a language other
  than English will be accepted if accompanied by an English translation of that
  text.    (vi)  Any solution that was publicly available prior to the start of
  the Contest Submission Period (August 7-10, 2014) is not eligible for entry
  in the Contest, unless the solution submitted incorporated significant new functionality,
  features, and changes that are not publicly available. Contestants must include
  a narrative description of the new functionality with any such Submission.    (vii)
   Submissions must not:    a. violate applicable law;    b. depict hatred;    c.
  be in bad taste;    d. denigrate (or be derogatory toward) any person or group

  community in society, including any specific race, ethnic group, or culture;    f.
  incite violence or be likely to incite violence;    g. contain vulgar or obscene
  language or excessive violence;    h. contain pornography, obscenity, or sexual
  activity; or    i. disparage the Sponsor.    (viii)  Submissions must be free
  of malware and other security threats. Contestant agrees that the Sponsor may
  conduct testing on each Submission to determine whether malware or other security
  threats may be present.    <br>(ix)  Submissions that do not comply with any of
  the above requirements may be disqualified.    D.  Additional Terms    <br>(i)  Once
  a Submission has been submitted, Contestant may not access or make any changes
  or alterations to the Submission.    <br>(ii)  A Contestant may submit more than
  one Submission. However, each Submission must be unique, as determined by Sponsor
  in its sole discretion. If a Contestant enters two or more Submissions that
  are substantially similar, the Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify Submissions
  or require the Contestant to choose one Submission to be entered into the Contest.    <br>(iii)
   By entering a Submission, Contestant represents, warrants, and agrees that
  the Submission is the original work of the Contestant and complies with the
  Official Rules.    Contestant further represents, warrants, and agrees that
  any use of the Submission by the Sponsor and/or Judges (or any of their respective
  partners, subsidiaries, and affiliates) as authorized by these Official Rules,
  does not:    a. infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate any intellectual
  property right or proprietary right including, without limitation, any statutory
  or common law trademark, copyright or patent, nor any privacy rights, nor any
  other rights of any person or entity;    b. constitute or result in any misappropriation
  or other violation of any person’s publicity rights or right of privacy.  <h2><strong>5.
   Submission Rights</strong></h2>  By entering a Submission to this Contest,
  Contestant grants to any person obtaining a copy of his or her Submission, a
  non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free and worldwide license to use, copy,
  modify, merge, publish, or distribute the Submission, any information and content
  submitted by the Contestant, and any portion thereof. Contestants agree that
  such Submissions shall be made and remain available to all for use on an open
  source basis, as defined by the Open Source Initiative, <em>see </em>opensource.org.
  Contestant further grants to the Sponsor the right to display the Submission
  on the Internet. Sponsor, and any third parties acting on its behalf, will also
  have the right to publicize Contestant’s name or codename and, as applicable,
  the names or codenames of Contestant’s team members, on the Contest Website
  at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">www.ftc.gov</a>, and in any media whatsoever,
  for advertising and publicity purposes relating to the Contest. The Contestant
  agrees that the foregoing constitutes solely a condition of the Contestant’s
  participation in the Contest, and that nothing herein shall constitute a procurement,
  including the acquisition of any intellectual property. See Section 12.C below.  <h2><strong>6.
   Winner Selection and Judging Criteria</strong></h2>  A.  All Submissions will
  be judged by an expert panel of judges (the “Judges”) selected by the Sponsor
  at the Sponsor’s sole discretion. The Sponsor reserves the right to substitute
  or modify the judging panel, or extend or modify the Judging Period, at any
  time for any reason.    B.  All Judges shall be required to remain fair and
  impartial. Any Judge may recuse him or herself from judging a Submission if
  the Judge or the Sponsor considers it inappropriate, for any reason, for the
  Judge to evaluate a specific Submission or group of Submissions.    C.  A Contestant’s
  likelihood of winning will depend on the number and quality of all of the Submissions,
  as determined by the Judges using the criteria in these Official Rules.    D. 
  For all phases, the Sponsor reserves the right to review the Judges’ decision
  and to withhold any Prize if, at the Sponsor’s sole discretion, there is a procedural,
  legal, or other reason that the Prize should not be awarded.    E.  The Judges
  will document the scores assigned to each Submission for each phase, and these
  scores may be subject to release by the Sponsor in its sole discretion or if
  required by law.    F.  The Sponsor and/or Judges intend to announce who earned
  the top scores from each of the 3 phases on August 10, 2014.  Prizes, however,
  will not be awarded and Winners will not be named, until the Sponsor verifies
  eligibility for receipt of each Prize in accordance with Section 11 below. 
  The Sponsor will announce verified Winners at a later date, and the results
  will be made available at the Contest Website.  <h2><strong>7.  Phase 1: </strong><strong>Creator</strong></h2>  A.
   Phase 1 Contestants will stand in the shoes of experts trying to understand
  and defeat robocaller tactics. Contestants will be required to: 1) build a honeypot
  that collects data on each call; and 2) categorize the calls based on the likelihood
  that the call is a robocall (a call delivering a prerecorded message).  In designing
  the honeypot, Contestants may not include any feature that requires ongoing
  manual processing. Each Contestant will receive free access to a Twilio account,
  which requires an agreement to comply with Twilio’s terms of service. Twilio
  will provide a platform that Contestants may use to build their honeypot and
  at least one phone number associated with the Twilio account.  If Contestants
  build a honeypot on Twilio’s platform, they will also receive $30 of credit.
  Without spending any credit, each Contestant may receive and send calls to the
  phone number associated with his or her Twilio account from one external phone
  number. To send and receive calls using additional lines, Contestants may spend
  up to their $30 credit limit. The credit may also be applied toward other Twilio
  features.  Contestants, however, are not required to use the Twilio platform
  and may use any tools they choose so long as Contestants also provide one or
  more honeypot phone lines, access to the associated call detail records or call
  logs, and any other information so that the Judges can test their Submissions
  without additional cost. Contestants will be disqualified, however, if they:
  1) place calls using an autodialing program or the functional equivalent; 2)
  adversely affect the Twilio platform; 3) adversely affect any other platform,
  product, system, or technology; 4) violate the terms of service of Twilio or
  any other third party provider; 5) do anything prohibited by law; or 6) place
  calls to any number outside their own honeypot. Judges will test the Submissions
  by sending calls to the honeypots and reviewing the information associated with
  incoming calls. Each Contestant will submit all source code in addition to a
  written description of the solution, consisting of fewer than 500 words, summarizing
  the Contestant’s techniques and outcomes.    <br><strong>Judging Criteria:</strong>    <strong><br>(i)
  Building Knowledge</strong> (70% of total score)  <ul>   <li>Did you succeed
  in identifying inaccuracies in the data captured?  You will receive ten points
  for each distinct successful method that your honeypot used to identify calls
  in which the data captured in any field was inaccurate.  Inaccurate data could
  include, but is not limited to, false caller ID number or date of the call. 
  Contestants will need to prove to the Judges’ satisfaction that the data captured
  was inaccurate, and the necessary level of proof is within the Judges’ sole
  discretion.  Furthermore, the Judges have sole discretion to determine whether
  two successful methods are meaningfully distinct.</li>   <li>Did your honeypot
  successfully categorize calls based on the likelihood that the calls are robocalls? 
  Contestants will receive up to 30 points based on the percentage of calls that
  are successfully categorized.  Contestants will need to prove to the Judges’
  satisfaction that the calls were accurately categorized, and the necessary level
  of proof is within the Judge’s sole discretion.</li>   <li>Is your honeypot
  scalable?  For each distinct method that your honeypot uses to categorize or
  verify the accuracy of the data collected, Contestants will receive five points
  for each such method that is easily replicable and adaptable. Furthermore, the
  Judges have sole discretion to determine whether two methods are meaningfully
  distinct.</li>   <li>The Judges will compare the total points earned by each
  Contestant in this category and use these totals to assign a percentage amount
  of no greater than 70% to each Contestant.</li>  </ul>  <strong> <br>(ii) Explaining
  the Scheme</strong> (20% of total score)  <ul>   <li>What insights did your
  Submission demonstrate with respect to setting up an effective robocall honeypot?</li>   <li>What
  insights did your Submission demonstrate in determining the accuracy of the
  data captured?</li>   <li>What insights did your Submission demonstrate in determining
  how to categorize calls based on the likelihood that the calls are robocalls?</li>  </ul>  <strong><br>(iii)
  Innovation</strong> (10% of total score)  <ul>   <li>How innovative was your
  Submission?</li>  </ul>  B.  In order to be considered for a Prize, Submissions
  must score at least one percentage point in each required category (building
  knowledge, explaining the scheme, and innovation). If the Judges determine that
  no one satisfies each required category, no one will be deemed eligible for
  any Prize.    C.  The one (1) Contestant whose Submission earns the highest
  overall score will be named Winner of the phase 1 Top Prize identified below
  in Section 10, if the Contestant satisfies the verification requirements described
  in Section 11. If the Contestant does not satisfy the verification requirements,
  the phase 1 Top Prize may be awarded to the next highest scorer who satisfies
  the verification requirements, at the Judges’ or Sponsor’s discretion.    D. 
  Up to two (2) Contestants with the subsequent highest scores who meet the Section
  11 verification requirements may be awarded the phase 1 Honorable Mention Prizes—described
  below in Section 10—at the Judges’ or Sponsor’s discretion.    E.  In the event
  of a tie between or among two or more Submissions where the Contestants meet
  the verification requirements, the relevant Prize identified below in Section
  10 will be divided equally between the tied Contestants.  <h2><strong>8.  Phase
  2: Attacker</strong></h2>  A. Phase 2 Contestants will look into the minds of
  robocallers. Each Contestant will receive a list of 25 phone numbers that belong
  to a robocall honeypot set up on the Twilio platform.  Contestants will also
  have free access to a Twilio account with $15 of credit that may be applied
  toward Twilio features.  Contestants will attempt to circumvent the robocall
  honeypot. Merely spoofing the caller ID information (i.e., providing inaccurate
  or missing Caller ID data) will not be counted as circumvention of the robocall
  honeypot. One example of a way that Contestants can successfully circumvent
  the robocall honeypot is by placing undetected calls to the robocall honeypot
  numbers. A call is “undetected” if it prevents the honeypot from gathering any
  data about the call, including that the call was made. Contestants will be disqualified
  if they: 1) place calls using an autodialing program or the functional equivalent;
  2) adversely affect the robocall honeypot; 3) adversely affect the Twilio platform;
  4) adversely affect any other platform, product, system, or technology; 5) violate
  the terms of service of Twilio or any other third party provider; 6) do anything
  prohibited by law; or 7) place calls to any number outside the robocall honeypot. 
  Contestants may use any tool or platform to circumvent the honeypot. For each
  circumvention effort, Contestants must provide the necessary means for Judges
  to test and replicate the attack.  If Contestants use a tool other than Twilio
  to place calls that circumvent the honeypot, Contestants must also provide access
  to their call detail records or call logs. In addition, each Contestant will
  submit all source code and a written description consisting of fewer than 500
  words summarizing: 1) the Contestant’s circumvention techniques and outcomes;
  2) theoretical circumvention techniques that the Contestant did not test but
  would be useful to a robocaller; and 3) how the Contestant would build a better
  honeypot to prevent such techniques.    <strong>Judging Criteria: </strong>    <strong><br>(i)
  Hitting the Target</strong> (50% of total score)  <ul>   <li>Did you succeed
  in circumventing the robocall honeypot? You will receive one point for each
  distinct method that you used to circumvent the robocall honeypot. Contestants
  will need to prove to the Judges’ satisfaction that they circumvented the honeypot,
  and the necessary level of proof is within the Judges’ sole discretion. Furthermore,
  the Judges have sole discretion to determine whether two circumvention methods
  are meaningfully distinct.</li>   <li>The Judges will compare the total points
  earned by each Contestant in this category and use these totals to assign a
  percentage amount of no greater than 50% to each Contestant.</li>  </ul>  <strong> <br>(ii)
  Explaining the Scheme</strong> (20% of total score)  <ul>   <li>What insights
  did your Submission demonstrate about how attackers might circumvent a robocall
  honeypot, including by placing undetected calls?</li>   <li>What theoretical
  techniques did your Submission describe for how attackers might circumvent a
  robocall honeypot?</li>  </ul>  <strong><br>(iii) Rebuilding</strong> (10% of total
  score)  <ul>   <li>What insights did your Submission demonstrate about building
  a better robocall honeypot?</li>  </ul>  <strong><br>(iv) Innovation</strong> (20%
  of total score)  <ul>   <li>How innovative were your actual or proposed methods
  of circumventing the honeypot?</li>  </ul>  B. In order to be considered for
  a Prize, Submissions must score at least one percentage point in each required
  category (hitting the target, explaining the scheme, rebuilding, and innovation). 
  If the Judges determine that no one satisfies each required category, no one
  will be deemed eligible for any Prize.    C.  The one (1) Contestant whose Submission
  earns the highest overall score will be named Winner of the phase 2 Top Prize
  identified below in Section 10, if the Contestant satisfies the verification
  requirements described in Section 11. If the Contestant does not satisfy the
  verification requirements, the phase 2 Top Prize may be awarded to the next
  highest scorer who satisfies the verification requirements, at the Judges’ or
  Sponsor’s discretion.    D.  Up to two (2) Contestants with the subsequent highest
  scores who meet the Section 11 verification requirements may be awarded the
  phase 2 Honorable Mention Prizes—described below in Section 10—at the Judges’
  or Sponsor’s discretion.    E.  In the event of a tie between or among two or
  more Submissions where the Contestants meet the verification requirements, the
  relevant Prize identified below in Section 10 will be divided equally between
  the tied Contestants.  <h2><strong>9. Phase 3: Detective</strong></h2>  A. Each
  phase 3 Contestant will receive two sets of call data from an existing robocall
  honeypot. The Sponsor will provide this data at the FTC’s “Zapping Rachel” booth
  at DEF CON 22, beginning at 9:00 am (PDT) on August 7, 2014. The first data
  set will identify calls that, based on real-world information, are likely to
  have been a robocall (a call delivering a prerecorded message). Based on information
  provided in the first data set, Contestants will develop an algorithm and will
  predict which of the calls in the second data set are likely to be robocalls.
  In addition to submitting these predictions, each Contestant will submit all
  source code and a written description of the algorithm consisting of fewer than
  250 words.    <strong>Judging Criteria:</strong>    <strong><br>(i) Uncovering the
  Truth</strong> (70% of total score)  <ul>   <li>Did you correctly predict whether
  the calls in the second honeypot data set were likely to be robocalls? To assess
  this, the Judges will compare your predictions with real-world information about
  which calls are likely to be a robocall. You will receive one point for each
  call you successfully identified as a likely robocall, and deducted one point
  for each call you inaccurately identified as a likely robocall.</li>   <li>The
  Judges will compare the total points earned by each Contestant in this category
  and use these totals to assign a percentage amount of no greater than 70% to
  each Contestant.</li>  </ul>  <strong><br>(ii) Explaining the Scheme</strong> (20%
  of total score)  <ul>   <li>What insights did your Submission demonstrate with
  respect to the analysis of honeypot call records?</li>  </ul>  <strong><br>(iii)
  Innovation</strong> (10% of total score)  <ul>   <li>How innovative was your
  Submission?</li>  </ul>  B.  In order to be considered for a Prize, Submissions
  must score at least one percentage point in each required category (uncovering
  the truth, explaining the scheme, and innovation). If the Judges determine that
  no one satisfies each required category, no one will be deemed eligible for
  any Prize.    C.  The one (1) Contestant whose Submission earns the highest
  overall score will be named Winner of the phase 3 Top Prize identified below
  in Section 10, if the Contestant satisfies the verification requirements described
  in Section 11. If the Contestant does not satisfy the verification requirements,
  the phase 3 Top Prize may be awarded to the next highest scorer who satisfies
  the verification requirements, at the Judges’ or Sponsor’s discretion.    D. 
  Up to two (2) Contestants with the subsequent highest scores who meet the Section
  11 verification requirements may be awarded the phase 3 Honorable Mention Prizes—described
  below in Section 10—at the Judges’ or Sponsor’s discretion.    E.  In the event
  of a tie between or among two or more Submissions where the Contestants meet
  the verification requirements, the relevant Prize identified below in Section
  10 will be divided equally between the tied Contestants.  <h2><strong>10.  Prizes</strong></h2>  <table

   If no eligible Submissions are entered in the Contest, the Prize will not be
  awarded. The Sponsor retains the right to make a Prize substitution in the event
  that funding for the Prize or any portion thereof becomes unavailable.  No transfer
  or substitution of a Prize is permitted except at the Sponsor’s sole discretion.
  It will be the responsibility of the winning team’s Representative to allocate
  the Prize amongst the team, as the Representative deems it appropriate.</p><p>    B. 
  In the event a Winner’s employer has a policy that prohibits the awarding of
  a Prize to an employee, the Winner must forfeit the Prize and the Sponsor may
  select an alternate Winner. Each Contestant hereby acknowledges and agrees that
  the relationship between the Contestant and the Sponsor is not a confidential,
  fiduciary, or other special relationship, and that the Contestant’s decision
  to provide the Contestant’s Submission to Sponsor for the purposes of this Contest
  does not place the Sponsor and its respective agents in a position that is any
  different from the position held by the members of the general public with regard
  to elements of the Contestant’s Submission, except as specifically provided
  in these Official Rules.</p><p>    C.  Winners <br>(including any winning team members)
  are responsible for reporting and paying all applicable federal, state, and
  local taxes. It is the sole responsibility of Winners of $600 or more to provide
  information to the Sponsor in order to facilitate receipt of the award, including
  completing and submitting any tax forms when necessary.  It is also the sole
  responsibility of Winners to satisfy any applicable reporting requirements.
  The Sponsor reserves the right to withhold a portion of the Prize amount to
  comply with tax laws.</p><p>    D.  All payments shall be made by electronic funds
  transfer or other means determined by the Sponsor.</p>  <h2><strong>11.  Verification
  of Eligibility for Receipt of a Prize </strong></h2>  <p>A.  ALL PRIZE AWARDS ARE
  SUBJECT TO SPONSOR VERIFICATION OF THE WINNER’S IDENTITY, ELIGIBILITY, AND PARTICIPATION
  IN THE CREATION OF THE SOLUTION.  THE SPONSOR’S DECISIONS ARE FINAL AND BINDING
  IN ALL MATTERS RELATED TO THE CONTEST. In order to receive a Prize, a Contestant
  will be required to complete, sign and return to the Sponsor affidavit(s) of
  eligibility and liability release, or a similar verification document (“Verification
  Form”).  31 U.S.C. 7701 requires Federal agencies to collect social security
  numbers to issue a payment. (In the case of a team, the Representative and
  all participating members must complete, sign and return to the Sponsor the
  Verification Form in order for the team to receive a Prize.)    </p><p>B.  Contestants
  potentially qualifying for a Prize will be notified and sent the Verification
  Form using the email address submitted at registration, starting on or about
  August 10, 2014. In the case of a team, the notification will only be sent to
  the Representative. If a notification is returned as undeliverable, the Contestant
  or team may be disqualified at the Sponsor’s sole discretion.    </p><p>C.  At the
  sole discretion of the Sponsor, a Contestant or team forfeits any Prize if:    <br>(i)
   the Contestant fails to provide the Verification Form within five (5) business
  days of receipt of the email notification discussed above (or in the case of
  a team, any team member fails to provide the Verification Form within five business
  days of receipt of the email notification);    <br>(ii)  the Contestant (or in the
  case of a team, its Representative) does not timely communicate with the Sponsor
  to provide payment and all other necessary information within five business
  days of receiving a request for such information;    <br>(iii)  such individual
  or team Representative is contacted and refuses the Prize;    <br>(iv)  the Prize
  is returned as undeliverable; or    <br>(v)  the Submission of the Winner, the Winner,
  or any member of a Winner’s team is disqualified for any reason.    </p><p>D.  In the
  event of a disqualification, Sponsor, at its sole discretion, may award the
  applicable Prize to an alternate Contestant. The disqualification of one (or
  more) team members at any time for any reason may result in the disqualification
  of the entire team and of each participating member at the sole discretion of
  the Sponsor.</p>  <h2><strong>12.  Entry Conditions and Release</strong></h2>  A.
   By entering, each Contestant <br>(including, in the case of a team, all participating
  members) agree(s) to:    <br>(i) comply with and be bound by these Official Rules
  and the decisions of the Sponsor and/or the Contest Judges, whose Rules and
  decisions are binding and final in all matters relating to this Contest;    <br>(ii)
  release, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Sponsor, Participating Organizations,
  and any other individuals or organizations responsible for sponsoring, fulfilling,
  administering, advertising, or promoting the Contest, including their respective
  parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies, if any, and all of their respective
  past and present officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives
  (hereafter the “Released Parties”) from and against any and all claims, expenses,
  and liabilities <br>(including reasonable attorneys’ fees), including but not limited
  to negligence and damages of any kind to persons and property, defamation, slander,
  libel, violation of right of publicity, infringement of trademark, copyright
  or other intellectual property rights, property damage, or death or personal
  injury arising out of or relating to a Contestant’s entry, creation of Submission
  or entry of a Submission, participation in the Contest, acceptance or use or
  misuse of the Prize and/or the broadcast, transmission, performance, exploitation,
  or use of Submission as authorized or licensed by these Official Rules.    B.
   Without limiting the foregoing, each Contestant agrees to release all Released
  Parties of all liability in connection with:    <br>(i)  any incorrect or inaccurate
  information, whether caused by the Sponsor’s or a Contestant’s electronic or
  printing error or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or
  utilized in the Contest;    <br>(ii)  technical failures of any kind, including,
  but not limited to, malfunctions, interruptions, or disconnections in phone
  lines, internet connectivity, or electronic transmission errors, or network
  hardware or software or failure of the Contest Website, or any other platform
  or tool that Contestants or Judges choose to use;    <br>(iii)  unauthorized human
  intervention in any part of the entry process or the Contest;    <br>(iv)  technical
  or human error that may occur in the administration of the Contest or the processing
  of Submissions; or    (v)  any injury or damage to persons or property that
  may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from the Contestant’s
  participation in the Contest or receipt or use or misuse of any Prize.  If for
  any reason any Contestant’s Submission is confirmed to have been erroneously
  deleted, lost, or otherwise destroyed or corrupted, the Contestant’s sole remedy
  is to request the opportunity to resubmit its Submission.  The request will
  be addressed at the sole discretion of the Sponsor if the Contest Submission
  Period is still open.    C.  The Contest is not a procurement. The Sponsor does
  not acquire any intellectual property and Contestants agree to permit the Sponsor
  to publicize Contestants and Contest Winners solely as a condition of the Contestant’s
  participation in the Contest. See Paragraph 14 below.    D.  Based on the subject
  matter of the Contest, the type of work that it possibly will require, and the
  likelihood of any claims for death, bodily injury, or property damage, or loss
  potentially resulting from challenge participation, the Sponsor determines that
  Contestants are not required to obtain liability insurance or demonstrate fiscal
  responsibility in order to participate in this Contest.  <h2><strong>13.  Publicity</strong></h2>  Participation
  in the Contest constitutes consent to Sponsor’s and its agents’ use of the Contestant’s
  name or codename (and, as applicable, those of all other members of the team
  that participated in the Submission) for promotional purposes in any media,
  worldwide, without further payment or consideration. Furthermore, a Contestant’s
  likeness, photograph, voice, opinions, comments, and/or hometown and state of
  residence (and, as applicable, those of all other members of the team that participated
  in the Submission) may be used if the Contestant provides consent.  <h2><strong>14.
   General Conditions</strong></h2>  <p>A.  Sponsor reserves the right to cancel,
  suspend, and/or modify the Contest, or any part of it, if any fraud, technical
  failure, or any other unanticipated factor or factors beyond Sponsor’s control
  impairs the integrity or proper functioning of the Contest, as determined by
  Sponsor at its sole discretion. The Sponsor reserves the right at its sole discretion
  to disqualify any individual or Contestant that the Sponsor finds to be tampering
  with the entry process or the operation of the Contest, or to be acting in violation
  of these Official Rules or in a manner that is inappropriate, not in the best
  interests of this Contest, or in violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p><p>    B.
   Any attempt by any person to undermine the proper functioning of the Contest
  may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be
  made, the Sponsor reserves the right to take proper legal action, including,
  without limiting, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unlawful activities.</p><p>    C.
   The Sponsor’s failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not
  constitute a waiver of that provision. The Sponsor is not responsible for incomplete,
  late, misdirected, damaged, lost, illegible, or incomprehensible Submissions
  or for address or email address changes of the Contestants. Proof of sending
  or submitting will not be deemed to be proof of receipt by Sponsor.</p><p>    D.  In
  the event of any discrepancy or inconsistency between the terms and conditions
  of the Official Rules and disclosures or other statements contained in any Contest
  materials, including but not limited to the Contest Website or point of sale,
  television, print or online advertising, the terms and conditions of the Official
  Rules shall prevail.</p><p>    E.  The Sponsor reserves the right, without liability,
  to amend the terms and conditions of the Official Rules at any time, including
  the rights or obligations of the Contestant and the Sponsor. The Sponsor will
  post the terms and conditions of the amended Official Rules on the Contest Website
  (“Corrective Notice”). As permitted by law, any amendment will become effective
  at the time the Sponsor posts the amended Official Rules.</p><p>    F.  Excluding Submissions,
  all intellectual property related to this Contest, including but not limited
  to trademarks, trade-names, logos, designs, promotional materials, web pages,
  source codes, drawings, illustrations, slogans, and representations are owned
  or used under license by the Sponsor. All rights are reserved.  Unauthorized
  copying or use of any copyrighted material or intellectual property without
  the express written consent of its owners is strictly prohibited.</p><p>    G.  Should
  any provision of these Official Rules be or become illegal or unenforceable
  under applicable Federal law, such illegality or unenforceability shall leave
  the remainder of these Official Rules unaffected and valid. The illegal or unenforceable
  provision shall be replaced by a valid and enforceable provision that comes
  closest and best reflects the Sponsor’s intention in a legal and enforceable
  manner with respect to the invalid or unenforceable provision.</p>  <h2><strong>15.
   Limitations of Liability</strong></h2>  By entering, all Contestants <br>(including,
  in the case of a team, all participating members) agree to be bound by the Official
  Rules and hereby release the Released Parties from any and all liability in
  connection with the Prizes or Contestant’s participation in the Contest, except
  for any claims against the Sponsor arising out of the unauthorized use or disclosure
  by the Sponsor of (1) the intellectual property of the participant beyond the
  authorized uses established in these rules, or (2) the trade secrets or confidential
  business information of the participant.  Provided, however, that any liability
  limitation regarding gross negligence or intentional acts, or events of death
  or body injury, shall not be applicable in jurisdictions where such limitation
  is not legal.  <h2><strong>16.  Disputes</strong></h2>  A.  Contestants agree
  that:    <br>(i) any and all disputes, claims, and causes of action arising out
  of or connected with this Contest, any Prizes awarded, the administration of
  the Contest, or the determination of Winners, shall be resolved individually;    <br>(ii)
  any and all disputes, claims, and causes of action arising out of or connected
  with this Contest, any Prizes awarded, the administration of the Contest, or
  the determination of Winners, shall be resolved pursuant to Federal law;    <br>(iii)
  under no circumstances will Contestants be entitled to, and Contestants hereby
  waive, all rights to claim, any punitive, incidental, and consequential damages
  and any and all rights to have damages multiplied or otherwise increased.    B.
   All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation,
  and enforceability of these Official Rules, or the rights and obligations of
  the Contestants and the Sponsor in connection with the Contest, shall be governed
  by, and construed in accordance with, Federal law.  <h2><strong>17.  Privacy</strong></h2>  The
  Sponsor may collect personal information from you when you enter the Contest.
   Such personal information collected is subject to the privacy policy located
  here: <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/site-information/privacy-policy">http://www.ftc.gov/site-information/privacy-policy</a>.  <h2><strong>18.
