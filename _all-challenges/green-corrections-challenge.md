description: "<p>Your Ideas Can Make a Difference </p>  <p>Green corrections is what
  happens when we apply green principles to everyday practices in corrections. Even
  more simply put, it's applying what we know helps people save money, energy, and
  time in their personal lives and applying it wisely to relevant processes throughout
  America's correctional system. As the field of corrections changes, the need to
  begin approaching corrections problems with smarter, greener solutions becomes clearer.
  </p>  <p>The Green Corrections Challenge lays the foundation for future green corrections
  work, developing a strong community of individuals who are driving innovation through
  competition in the field. </p>  <p>The Green Corrections Challenge is also your
  chance to share with us your new ideas and effective best practices for green corrections.
  Whether you're a citizen concerned about public safety or a student or professional
  in the field, you probably have a few good ideas. You may have thought of creative
  ways to conserve energy in a facility, provide job training, save fuel, or reduce
  time. You may be part of innovations for pretrial, offender reentry, visitation,
  faith-based programs, college and university initiatives, job training, or building
  design. There are numerous combinations and unlimited possibilities. Some of them
  are ones that only you've thought of. </p>  <p>In a presentation of 7 minutes or
  less, we want you to tell us your idea or practice. We've created three primary
  categories (correctional facilities, education and training, and reentry programs)
  and one additional category for new green concepts (for ideas that don't fit neatly
  into one of the other three areas). You can submit one presentation for each category,
  giving you up to four different opportunities to share. </p>  <p>The creators of
  a presentation from each category will be selected for the opportunity to share
  their idea or practice in a webinar hosted by the National Institute of Corrections.
  In the webinar, you'll be able to share how your suggestion would be implemented.
  </p>  <p>With a little creativity, each of us can play a role in invigorating the
  field with new ideas—your ideas—on how to apply green practices and help make a
  difference in thousands of lives.</p>  <p>We’re looking for the most innovative
  programs across the nation.</p>"
