description: <p>The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences
  (NCATS), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking
  innovative ways to communicate with others and educate people about rare
  diseases through social media or art. There are about 7,000 different rare
  diseases that affect an estimated 30 million people in the United States. Some
  difficulties with rare diseases are that they are hard to recognize, are often
  hidden conditions, and most do not currently have ongoing medical research.
  The goal of this Challenge, which is being led by NCATS&rsquo; Office of Rare
  Diseases Research (ORDR), is to bring attention to rare diseases so that they
  can gain more medical research interest, thereby improving the lives of people
  with rare diseases. Science, especially genetic medicine, has moved forward to
  the point now where treatments are possible&mdash;such as gene therapies, 3-D
  printing (devices, tissues, and organs), and new drugs. Everyone deserves a
  chance at an effective medical treatment&mdash;whether for a common disease or
  a rare one.</p> <p>You can help us get the word out by competing in our rare
