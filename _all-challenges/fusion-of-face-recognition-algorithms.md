description: 'Can you leverage the data outputs of multiple face recognition algorithms
  to improve overall accuracy?  There is a large literature on biometric fusion intended
  to improve accuracy via fusion of multiple modalities (e.g., face + fingerprint),
  multiple algorithms, or multiple samples.  However, most of the research has only
  addressed 1:1 verification at the score-level.  This prize challenge is aimed at
  stimulating research into methods to improve one-to-many (i.e., 1:N) identification
  accuracy via template-level fusion.  Can further accuracy gains be realized by fusing
  feature-level templates or through more innovative score-level fusion methods informed
  by modern data science?    <hr />    <strong>Who We Are:  </strong>The Intelligence
  Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), within the Office of the Director of
  National Intelligence (ODNI), focuses on high-risk, high-payoff research programs
  to tackle difficult challenges of the agencies and disciplines in the intelligence
  community.  IARPA’s challenges invite experts from the broader research community
  to participate in IARPA research in a convenient, efficient, and non-contractual
  way.    <strong>What We’re Doing:  </strong>The 2018 FOFRA challenge tasks developers
  with fusing the outputs of multiple face recognition algorithms applied to the same
  input images.  Fusion can be conducted on templates, before recognition, or on scores
  produced by recognition, with prizes awarded for best improvements to verification
  and identification accuracy.    <strong>Why We’re Doing This:  </strong>Face recognition
  error rates, particularly on uncontrolled face imagery, are well above zero.  While
  algorithm development has seen considerable investment, other mechanisms for improving
  accuracy are known.  Among them, there is a large academic literature on biometric
  fusion, covering multimodal and multi-algorithmic fusion.  It shows that substantial
  accuracy gains can be made over using a single mode, or a single algorithm alone,
  and this can be achieved, in large part, using quite simple methods.  The gains
  reduce when the fused inputs are correlated.  The vast majority of the literature
  addresses biometric verification, rather than identification.  Moreover, the literature
  covers score-level fusion rather than feature (i.e. template) level fusion.  The
  latter, on information theoretic grounds, offers greater accuracy gains at the expense
  of some complexity.    <strong>Where and When We’re Doing This:</strong>  Registration
  to join the challenge will take place through Challenge.gov.  You can find the challenge
  details and rules at that site.  From the Challenge.gov webpage, participants will
  be directed to register with the National Institute of Standards and Technology
  (NIST).  Registration closes on <strong><u>August 6, 2018</u></strong>.  <ul>    <li><strong>When
  does FOFRA registration begin? </strong> May 23, 2018</li>    <li><strong>Where
  to learn more about the challenge, including rules, criteria and eligibility requirements?</strong>  <ul>    <li>This

  <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/fusion-face-recognition-algorithms-2018">NIST

  on the API and other documents?</strong>  June 6, 2018</li>    <li><strong>When
  is the registration deadline?</strong>  August 6, 2018</li>    <li><strong>When
  will winners be announced?</strong>  October 2018</li>  </ul>  The challenge will
  proceed with developers sending pre-compiled software libraries to NIST, who is
  the designated test laboratory for FOFRA.  At NIST the algorithms will be run on
  sequestered images.    <strong>Who Should Participate?</strong> The FOFRA Prize
  Challenge is intended for prize participants who are eligible to compete for the
  challenge prizes.  We encourage researchers in the fields of biometrics, computer
  vision, and data science to participate, both domestic and international, from academia
  and industry. Other U. S. Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development
  Centers (FFRDCs), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), or any other similar
  organizations that have a special relationship with the Government that gives them
  access to privileged or proprietary information, or access to Government equipment
  or real property, will not be eligible to participate in the prize challenge.  Entities
  affiliated with the IARPA Janus program may participate, but are ineligible to win
  prize monies.    <strong>Why Participate: </strong>The developers of the fusion
  methods with the greatest improvements in match accuracy will be eligible to win
  cash prizes from a total prize purse of $70,000.  Prizes will be awarded in four
  categories: template- and score-level fusion applied to verification and identification,
  with extra awards to winners who opt to open-source their approaches.    <strong>Related
