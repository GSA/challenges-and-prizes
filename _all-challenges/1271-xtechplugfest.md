# Description

The Program Executive Office for Intelligence Electronic Warfare & Sensors (PEO IEW&S), Project Manager Positioning Navigation & Timing (PM PNT), the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) and the C5ISR (Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) Center, are pleased to announce the xTechPlugfest Competition also known as the PNT CMOSS Plugfest. The Army will host the PNT CMOSS Plugfest at the Open Innovation Lab (OIL) from **8 – 19 November 2021.** The OIL is a truly open collaborative space where industry, academia, and government can join forces to create the cutting edge of PNT technology (<https://apntoil.army.mil/>).

PEO IEW&S, PM PNT and DEVCOM C5ISR have partnered with the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) to deliver this competition. The Army recognizes that it must continue enhancing engagements with eligible businesses by (1) understanding the spectrum of ‘world-class’ technologies being developed commercially that may benefit the Department of Defense (DoD) and (2) integrating the sector of commercial innovators into the DoD Science and Technology (S&T) ecosystem. PNT CMOSS Plugfest will allow for cooperation between eligible businesses and Army PNT stakeholders, provide for prize money, and enable government stakeholders to provide feedback to these businesses to help accelerate the transition of technology into the Army.

The PNT CMOSS Plugfest will provide non-dilutive seed prizes to select entities to attend and participate to demonstrate capabilities that currently exist for **(1) PNT CMOSS cards, (2) CMOSS switch cards and (3) CMOSS chassis** to meet CMOSS compliance. Ultimately 15 entities will be invited to demonstrate their technology solutions at the PNT CMOSS Plugfest event tentatively scheduled between 8-19 November 2021 at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD, compete for prize money and up to five (5) overall winners may be invited to submit a proposal for a follow-on prototype award for their cards and/or chassis solutions (contract amounts TBD).  Details on the prize structure, schedule, and evaluation factors are listed below in this announcement.

The efforts described in this Announcement are being pursued under the authorities of 10 U.S.C. § 2374a (Prizes for Advanced Technology Achievements) and 10 U.S.C. § 2371b (Prototype Projects). 

**Purpose**

PM PNT efforts focus on developing an assured PNT (A-PNT) capability as CMOSS. PM PNT is looking to understand what capabilities currently exist for (1) PNT CMOSS cards, (2) CMOSS switch cards and (3) CMOSS chassis while learning what development efforts are underway to meet CMOSS compliance. 

**Problem Statements**

The Army needs CMOSS (C5ISR/Electronic Warfare Modular Open Suite of Standards) solutions that address the overburdened vehicle platform size, weight, power and cooling (SWaP-C) shortcomings while enabling Multi-Domain Operations (MDO). Solutions need to minimize platform specific integration, and enable the fielding of subsequent capabilities (i.e., circuit card assemblies) without the need of any additional cabling or mounts.

# Judging Criteria

Each application will be evaluated as follows:

**Part One: Registration**

***PNT CARD APPLICATIONS:***

All PNT CARD applications must meet the following threshold requirements:

1. Timing cards must comply with a slot profile of SLT3x-TIM-2S1U22S1U2U1H-14.9.2-1 and a module profile of MOD3p-TIM-2S1U22S1U2U1H-16.9.2-2 as defined in ANSI/VITA 65.0 and ANSI/VITA 65.1. Connections on the front of timing cards can only be for key fill and maintenance. 
2. Timing cards must support a 100 MHz Radial REF_CLK and a 1 PPS Radial AUX_CLK.

Each PNT CARDS application meeting the threshold requirements will be evaluated based on their ability to meet the following characteristics:

Each application meeting the specified threshold requirements will be evaluated by the PNT CMOSS Plugfest team based on the criteria described above and up to 15 of the most highly evaluated applicants will be selected and awarded a prize of $5,000 and invited to the PNT CMOSS Plugfest event in Part 2.

**Part 2: Plugfest Event**

In Part 2: Plugfest Event, up to 15 selected Finalists from Part 1 will be invited to attend the Plugfest Event tentatively scheduled for in-person between 8-19 November 2021. Participants will tentatively be required to travel to the OIL located on Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Maryland for their assigned date and time. There will be no cost reimbursement provided for any travel associated for the event. While at the OIL, PNT CMOSS cards, CMOSS switch cards and CMOSS chassis will be evaluated based on laboratory measurements of the same evaluation criteria in Part 1 and other evaluation factors that will be provided to the Part 2 participants.  Further details on each scoring dimension and dimension weighting will be provided to all Part 2 participants.  Upon conclusion of the event, up to five (5) of the most highly evaluated participants in Part 2 will be selected as the PNT CMOSS Plugfest winners and awarded an additional prize of $15,000 each and an invitation to submit an application for a follow-on prototype award.  Up to five (5) runner-ups based on the evaluations will be selected and awarded an additional prize of $10,000.  All 15 participants in Part 2 will receive detailed feedback on their solutions from the PNT CMOSS Plugfest team through written evaluations and virtual de-briefs at a date and time to be determined following the competition.

**Part 3: Potential Follow-on Contract**

The up-to five (5) winners selected from Part 2 will be the only entities eligible to participate in Part 3: an invitation to submit a proposal for a follow-on prototype award for their cards and/or chassis solutions. Up to five (5) proposals may be selected for follow-on awards. A separate announcement will be issued with detailed instructions on how to submit the follow-on prototype proposal and will be provided to the Finalists selected for a prize award from Part 2.
