description: <p>Join us for this exciting UAS (unmanned aerial systems) prize competition using your ingenuity and hardware build expertise to create a concept for a UAS prototype. The result of the <strong>UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) Flight and Payload Challenge&nbsp;</strong>will support the public safety community and its stakeholders.</p>
    <p>One of the barriers for UAS used in a public safety realm is payload versus flight time. Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAS provide many different mission capabilities, but their flight time is limited. The payload capacity, energy source and flight time are linked through design trade-offs that can be optimized for efficiency and flexibility. This challenge is designed to keep the UAS and its payload airborne for the longest time possible to support first responders&rsquo; communication technology on the ground while they conduct their search. The advancement of UAS research will help search and rescue operations support payloads for wireless communications or other life-saving goods to save lives.</p>
    <p>NIST Public Safety Communications Research Program is hosting this 3-stage challenge, with prize awards totaling $432,000 (includes travel, prototype &amp; cash prizes) for the top 10 designs.&nbsp; In addition to the cash prize, finalists will showcase their UAS and flight skills with paid travel to the NIST Robotics Lab and the 2018 PSCR Stakeholder conference, where pilots will demonstrate their prototype, engage in speaking opportunities and network with 500+ attendees. There are no fees or qualifications needed to enter the first stage.&nbsp; The Stage 1 winning ideas will be eligible for remaining stages of the competition. (see Official Rules)</p>
    <p>You can make a difference!&nbsp; Continue reading for contest stages and details.&nbsp; <strong>To enter, submit your entry by clicking here, on the left side of the Challenge.gov posting by January 29,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>. &nbsp;</p>

    <li>Must be free flying, no tethers;</li>
    <li>Must include the interchangeable payload adapter for this challenge;</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>The payload adapter allows for the different weight payloads to be interchangeable for test flights. The payload adapter will include a 10 inch x 10 inch plate with 8020 aluminum extrusion rails attached to two opposite sides of the plate to attach the payload. The payload will extend up to 8 inches from the base plate. The design must include at least four points of connection to the 8020 rails to ensure the payload is safely secured. A detailed technical specification for the payload adapter will be provided to invited contestants in the Prototyping, Hardware Build and Video Test &amp; Evaluation Contest.
    <ul>
    <li>T-Slotted Aluminum Extrusions 10 inch long, with a 1 inch x 1 inch cross-section similar to this:&nbsp; https://8020.net/shop/1010-s.html</li>
    <li>The aluminum extrusion rails must be secured to the UAV using a minimum of four (4) 1/4&rdquo;-20 steel bolts (similar to https://8020.net/shop/3066.html) of appropriate lengths and four (4) corresponding 1/4&rdquo;-20 T-Nuts (similar to https://8020.net/shop/3286.html).</li>
    <li>The payload volume will be approximately 8 x 8 x 6 inches.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>Must include a flight termination system or &ldquo;kill switch&rdquo; to end flight if necessary;
    <ul>

    <li>Contestants will review the terms and conditions of participation and accept the terms and conditions for entry.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>Contestants are not permitted to expend more than $20,000 on hardware. This is the hardware budget for all contestants.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>Contestants will complete their prototyping and hardware build process and be required to hold check-in meetings once every two weeks with the NIST team to report on progress.</li>
    <li>Contestants must keep records of all hardware purchased or created for the prototype to ensure their entry is compliant. Records must show that all components included in the build are acquired appropriately, accounted for, and reported correctly for review.</li>
    <li>Reporting requirements are similar to a build list or acquisition list, something that a NIST staff member can review and verify to ensure that the hardware assembled is within the hardware budget allowed for each contestant. This hardware budget is in place to ensure that all contestants have the same resources to enable their creativity. Contestants who violate this critical requirement will be removed from the competition and no longer be eligible for future contests as part of this challenge.</li>
    <li>The images of the prototype UAS, the build list, and an interview with the NIST staff, judge panel and SME will be required prior to contestants being invited to the next stage of the challenge.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>Contestants will complete a series of recorded flights. Each flight will begin with a safety check which meets NIST safety check standards, then the contestant will place the UAS in a safe test flight location. The contestant(s) will complete a series of standardized tests to ensure the UAS can be safely operated within a confined space and achieve basic performance requirements.</li>
    <li>All contestants will provide their test flight video to NIST via secure file transfer for review and verification prior to the contest closing date. The test flight video must have a minimum resolution of 1,280 x720 pixels. The test flight video should include the view of the UAS in the air from the moment of takeoff to the moment of landing, a view from a camera onboard the UAS looking straight down, a view of the controller(s) for the UAS, and a view of a clock with at least a one (1) second resolution. The four (4) views should be clearly visible in the same video image simultaneously. This may be accomplished by strategically positioning the video camera relative to the UAS, controller(s), and clock such that these three (3) components are visible to the camera; or by feeding live video from several cameras pointed at the UAS, controller(s), and clock, respectively, into a video Multiview processor that can combine multiple inputs into one video output.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>UAS Specifications</h2>
    <p>Aircraft entered will be subject to the following requirements and limitations:</p>

    <li>10 lbs.</li>
    <li>15 lbs.</li>
    <li>20 lbs.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Contest flights will be conducted in an outdoor environment. Each contestant will be assigned a flight area to complete their preflight safety checks and full test flight. Each flight area will be bordered by a safety zone. The UAS will need to achieve an altitude of 50 feet above the surface, navigate to an assigned position, maintain a constant stationary position for the maximum time it is capable of flying, and then safely land.</li>
    <li>After all of the contest flights, the Judges will convene and discuss each of the contestants&rsquo; performance and give their final scores in accordance with the review criteria.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Evaluation Criteria and Judging:</h2>
    <p>NIST will review each contestant entry in the Live Test &amp; Evaluation Contest. A submission that fails to meet the compliance criteria will be disqualified and will be ineligible to compete in this contest. Submissions that pass the initial compliance review will be evaluated and scored by a panel of judges. An evaluation of a submission by a panel of judges does not constitute the NIST&rsquo;s final determination of contestant or submission eligibility. Submissions will be judged according to the criteria below:</p>
    <h3>Criteria:&nbsp; UAS Safety review (full Compliance required:&nbsp; Pass/Fail)</h3>
    <p>Review the contestants&rsquo; prototype UAS, to ensure it is compliant with the safety features required and that contestants are properly completing pre-flight safety checks, and completing safety inflight tests.</p>
    <h3>Criteria:&nbsp; Position Stability &amp; Landing Accuracy</h3>
    <p>Once the contestants have completed all preflight safety checks, they will be assigned a test flight area. To begin the test flight, the contestant will complete a vertical takeoff from the vertical takeoff and landing location, navigate to an assigned location and hover in place. The hover location will be 50ft above the ground, and the UAV must maintain a location within a three-dimensional space (5 ft. variance on the x, y, z axis) for as long as safely possible. Once the UAV has achieved its maximum flight time, it must safely land to complete the flight. The contestant will navigate the UAV back to the same location as the vertical take off and safely land. The distance between the actual UAV landing location and the vertical takeoff and landing location will be measured to determine landing accuracy.</p>
    <h3>Criteria:&nbsp; UAS Flight &amp; Payload review</h3>
    <p>Review the contestants&rsquo; prototype UAS, to award points based on performance for flight and payload:</p>
    <table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td width="208">Payload</td>
    <td width="208">Time</td>

### Description


<p>Join us for this exciting UAS (unmanned aerial systems) prize competition using your ingenuity and hardware build expertise to create a concept for a UAS prototype. The result of the <strong>UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) Flight and Payload Challenge&nbsp;</strong>will support the public safety community and its stakeholders.</p>
<p>One of the barriers for UAS used in a public safety realm is payload versus flight time. Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAS provide many different mission capabilities, but their flight time is limited. The payload capacity, energy source and flight time are linked through design trade-offs that can be optimized for efficiency and flexibility. This challenge is designed to keep the UAS and its payload airborne for the longest time possible to support first responders&rsquo; communication technology on the ground while they conduct their search. The advancement of UAS research will help search and rescue operations support payloads for wireless communications or other life-saving goods to save lives.</p>
<p>NIST Public Safety Communications Research Program is hosting this 3-stage challenge, with prize awards totaling $432,000 (includes travel, prototype &amp; cash prizes) for the top 10 designs.&nbsp; In addition to the cash prize, finalists will showcase their UAS and flight skills with paid travel to the NIST Robotics Lab and the 2018 PSCR Stakeholder conference, where pilots will demonstrate their prototype, engage in speaking opportunities and network with 500+ attendees. There are no fees or qualifications needed to enter the first stage.&nbsp; The Stage 1 winning ideas will be eligible for remaining stages of the competition. (see Official Rules)</p>
<p>You can make a difference!&nbsp; Continue reading for contest stages and details.&nbsp; <strong>To enter, submit your entry by clicking here, on the left side of the Challenge.gov posting by January 29,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>. &nbsp;</p>

<h1>OFFICIAL RULES OF THE PROTOTYPING, HARDWARE BUILD AND VIDEO TEST &amp; EVALUATION CONTEST&nbsp;(Stage 2)</h1>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this contest, the contestants will purchase or create the hardware necessary to implement the approach outlined within their concept paper. Contestants will utilize their funding to purchase or create (for example, using 3D printing or machining) the hardware or parts necessary to build their prototype UAS to the specifications and required safety standards. Once the build is complete, contestants will be required to complete a series of Video Test &amp; Evaluation flights designed to ensure the contestants complete minimum requirements for safety, hardware configuration, flight time and payload with their prototype UAS. Contestants who complete this stage successfully will receive an invitation to the NIST Robotics Test Facility and up to $10,000 in invitational travel funds to attend the final Live Test &amp; Evaluation contest. Contestants are limited to those selected from the Concept Paper Contest.</p>
<h2>Important Dates:</h2>
<p><strong><u>Link to Program Schedule 1</u></strong></p>
<h2>How to Enter:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Once contestants are selected from the Concept Paper Contest, they will be required to participate in an introduction and challenge kickoff event. This event may be in person or online, and is required.</li>
<li>Contestants will review the terms and conditions of participation and accept the terms and conditions for entry.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Contestants are not permitted to expend more than $20,000 on hardware. This is the hardware budget for all contestants.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Contestants will complete their prototyping and hardware build process and be required to hold check-in meetings once every two weeks with the NIST team to report on progress.</li>
<li>Contestants must keep records of all hardware purchased or created for the prototype to ensure their entry is compliant. Records must show that all components included in the build are acquired appropriately, accounted for, and reported correctly for review.</li>
<li>Reporting requirements are similar to a build list or acquisition list, something that a NIST staff member can review and verify to ensure that the hardware assembled is within the hardware budget allowed for each contestant. This hardware budget is in place to ensure that all contestants have the same resources to enable their creativity. Contestants who violate this critical requirement will be removed from the competition and no longer be eligible for future contests as part of this challenge.</li>
<li>The images of the prototype UAS, the build list, and an interview with the NIST staff, judge panel and SME will be required prior to contestants being invited to the next stage of the challenge.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Contestants will complete a series of recorded flights. Each flight will begin with a safety check which meets NIST safety check standards, then the contestant will place the UAS in a safe test flight location. The contestant(s) will complete a series of standardized tests to ensure the UAS can be safely operated within a confined space and achieve basic performance requirements.</li>
<li>All contestants will provide their test flight video to NIST via secure file transfer for review and verification prior to the contest closing date. The test flight video must have a minimum resolution of 1,280 x720 pixels. The test flight video should include the view of the UAS in the air from the moment of takeoff to the moment of landing, a view from a camera onboard the UAS looking straight down, a view of the controller(s) for the UAS, and a view of a clock with at least a one (1) second resolution. The four (4) views should be clearly visible in the same video image simultaneously. This may be accomplished by strategically positioning the video camera relative to the UAS, controller(s), and clock such that these three (3) components are visible to the camera; or by feeding live video from several cameras pointed at the UAS, controller(s), and clock, respectively, into a video Multiview processor that can combine multiple inputs into one video output.</li>
</ul>
<h2>UAS Specifications</h2>
<p>Aircraft entered will be subject to the following requirements and limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must not be a completely unaltered commercial, off-the-shelf UAS; the intent of the challenge is to design a UAS that is customized for the specific flight time and payload requirements of the challenge;</li>
<li>Must be capable of autonomous and human controlled flight;</li>
<li>Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAS with the ability to hover in place;</li>
<li>Must be free flying, no tethers;</li>
<li>Must include the interchangeable payload adapter for this challenge;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The payload adapter allows for the different weight payloads to be interchangeable for test flights. The payload adapter will include a 10 inch x 10 inch plate with 8020 aluminum extrusion rails attached to two opposite sides of the plate to attach the payload. The payload will extend up to 8 inches from the base plate. The design must include at least four points of connection to the 8020 rails to ensure the payload is safely secured. A detailed technical specification for the payload adapter will be provided to invited contestants in the Prototyping, Hardware Build and Video Test &amp; Evaluation Contest.

<li>The aluminum extrusion rails must be secured to the UAV using a minimum of four (4) 1/4&rdquo;-20 steel bolts (similar to https://8020.net/shop/3066.html) of appropriate lengths and four (4) corresponding 1/4&rdquo;-20 T-Nuts (similar to https://8020.net/shop/3286.html).</li>
<li>The payload volume will be approximately 8 x 8 x 6 inches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Must include a flight termination system or &ldquo;kill switch&rdquo; to end flight if necessary;
<ul>
<li>The UAS system must include an independent flight termination system (FTS) that can be remotely activated from the ground by pressing an &ldquo;emergency stop button&rdquo;. When remotely activated, the FTS must disconnect the power to the aircraft's propulsion system (e.g., the motors). Optionally, the FTS may also activate other complementary systems (e.g., a parachute) in addition to disconnecting the power to the aircraft&rsquo;s propulsion system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UAS energy source must be safely integrated into the flight system (electric battery, liquid fuel, etc.);</li>
<li>Entire prototype UAS must fit within 6 ft. x 4ft. x3 ft., and weigh no more than 55 pounds (UAS + payload);</li>
<li>Must have continuous radio communication with the UAS Controller and be capable of multiple channels or frequencies; and
<ul>
<li>As part of the envisioned scenario, a remotely-controlled UAS is expected to use a wireless connection (or radio link) between the controller and/or flight computer and the aircraft. The UAS may also be operating in the presence of other radio signals that could interfere with the wireless connection. In order to minimize potential interference, participants are required to use radios based on FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Platform, on-board systems, and UAS controllers can be commercial, off the shelf or custom made but all components to the UAS system must be purchased or created within the $20,000 hardware budget allowed for each contestant.</li>

<h2>Important Dates:</h2>
<p><strong><u>Link to Program Schedule 1</u></strong></p>
<h2>How to Enter:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Contestants completing the Prototyping, Hardware Build and Video Test &amp; Evaluation Contest should be prepared to complete a similar series of preflight, inflight and safe operation tests on day one of the Live Test &amp; Evaluation Contest. All contestants will be required to complete these safety checks prior to any contest flights.</li>
<li>All operators or pilots must be 107 FAA certified or under the supervision of a certified pilot who is a member of the contestant&rsquo;s team.</li>
<li>Contestants will be assigned a flight time to demonstrate their prototype UAS capabilities to a panel of judges in real-time and without interruption for the duration of a series of contest flights with different payloads:
<ul>
<li>10 lbs.</li>
<li>15 lbs.</li>
<li>20 lbs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Contest flights will be conducted in an outdoor environment. Each contestant will be assigned a flight area to complete their preflight safety checks and full test flight. Each flight area will be bordered by a safety zone. The UAS will need to achieve an altitude of 50 feet above the surface, navigate to an assigned position, maintain a constant stationary position for the maximum time it is capable of flying, and then safely land.</li>
<li>After all of the contest flights, the Judges will convene and discuss each of the contestants&rsquo; performance and give their final scores in accordance with the review criteria.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Evaluation Criteria and Judging:</h2>
<p>NIST will review each contestant entry in the Live Test &amp; Evaluation Contest. A submission that fails to meet the compliance criteria will be disqualified and will be ineligible to compete in this contest. Submissions that pass the initial compliance review will be evaluated and scored by a panel of judges. An evaluation of a submission by a panel of judges does not constitute the NIST&rsquo;s final determination of contestant or submission eligibility. Submissions will be judged according to the criteria below:</p>
<h3>Criteria: UAS Safety review (full Compliance required: Pass/Fail)</h3>
<p>Review the contestants&rsquo; prototype UAS, to ensure it is compliant with the safety features required and that contestants are properly completing pre-flight safety checks, and completing safety inflight tests.</p>
<h3>Criteria: Position Stability &amp; Landing Accuracy</h3>
<p>Once the contestants have completed all preflight safety checks, they will be assigned a test flight area. To begin the test flight, the contestant will complete a vertical takeoff from the vertical takeoff and landing location, navigate to an assigned location and hover in place. The hover location will be 50ft above the ground, and the UAV must maintain a location within a three-dimensional space (5 ft. variance on the x, y, z axis) for as long as safely possible. Once the UAV has achieved its maximum flight time, it must safely land to complete the flight. The contestant will navigate the UAV back to the same location as the vertical take off and safely land. The distance between the actual UAV landing location and the vertical takeoff and landing location will be measured to determine landing accuracy.</p>
<h3>Criteria: UAS Flight &amp; Payload review</h3>
<p>Review the contestants&rsquo; prototype UAS, to award points based on performance for flight and payload:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<td width="208">Payload</td>

<td width="208">1 point per minute</td>
<td width="208">6</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp; Contestant scores will be calculated as: score = time x factor. Each contestant will receive a score for each contest flight and the total score will be calculated based on the cumulative score from all three (3) contest flights. Contestants with a minimum of 270 points are eligible for prizes. Those contestants exceeding the minimum will be ranked based on their performance for prizes, including safety compliance, landing accuracy, and position stability.</p>
