description: "<h2>Electronic Application Transformation –  Create a model electronic
  application for the National School Lunch Program and help millions of American
  students access school meals.</h2>  The cafeteria: it’s the nexus of school social
  life – a place to make friends finish up last night’s homework, refuel for recess,
  and play tic-tac-toe with your pizza toppings. But for many of America’s schoolchildren,
  the cafeteria also serves a more essential function – it’s where they receive half
  or more of their daily nutrition.    An overwhelming majority of America’s school
  children—roughly 50 million elementary and secondary school students—attend institutions
  that participate in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) school meal programs.
  Most consume school meals on a regular basis. In total, about 100,000 schools and
  institutions serve more than five billion meals through the National School Lunch
  Program (NSLP) and two billion via the School Breakfast Program (SBP) to America’s
  children each school year.    U.S. government assistance subsidizes all program
  meals and allows schools to serve free and substantially reduced-priced meals to
  children from low-income households.    Traditionally, households have applied for
  free or reduced-price meal benefits by submitting paper or online applications to
  their schools. Millions of these applications are filed every year, and nearly 10
  million low income children were approved to receive benefits in school year 2014-15
  through these applications.    However, due to issues with reporting, calculating,
  and processing, many applications contain errors that result in incorrect eligibility
  decisions for children.    The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) offers a prototype
  paper application on its website, and thousands of school districts have adopted
  or modified that application for their own use. Many districts also offer online
  applications, but the FNS does not have an electronic prototype for them to use
  as a model. <em>And</em> <em>that’s where you come in!</em>    We want you to develop
  a forward-looking, web-based application form using personalized behavioral prompts,
  UX best practices, and edit-checks to assist in accurate form completion.    Applications
  must be skillfully and artfully designed to limit the burden on applicants and achieve
  two additional goals:  <ol>   <li>Facilitate access to program benefits for eligible
  children, and</li>   <li>Strengthen program integrity by reducing application errors.</li>
  \ </ol>  Through this hackathon, we hope to develop a prototype that can be shared
  with all school districts, and that incorporates the best ideas and insights from
  UX designers and software developers. By participating, you have the chance to impact
  the user experience of millions of applicants and improve a program that helps ensure
  that American children have access to healthy school meals."
