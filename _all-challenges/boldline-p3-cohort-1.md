description: "<strong>What is Boldline?</strong>    <strong>Boldline </strong>is the
  U.S. Department of State’s new partnership accelerator aimed to support and scale
  innovative public-private partnerships (P3s).    One of the first programs of its
  kind, Boldline supports social good public-private partnerships that address pressing
  global challenges and focuses on giving them tools to scale their missions. The
  main goal of Boldline is to build and deploy strategic connections and collaborations
  aimed at: a) strengthening the global partnership building ecosystem; b) promoting
  and facilitating connectivity between the private sector and governments; and c)
  fostering innovative partnership business models.  Boldline will take the often
  dotted lines between government, private sector and civil society and create a bold
  line between the sectors through partnerships.    <strong>THE ACCELERATOR</strong>
  \   The U.S. Department of State in close collaboration with industry leaders will
  organize a one-week partnership building accelerator program that will bring together
  selected stakeholders of public-private partnerships, including public institutions,
  corporations, innovation companies, entrepreneurship support organizations, and
  financial institutions to galvanize interest for the participating partnerships
  and to help build the framework for these partnerships in targeted countries.  The
  program will identify timely P3s that are in the early development stages of their
  partnerships or are ready to scale their operations and activities. Through a one
  week accelerator and ongoing support, Boldline will provide the individuals and
  institutions behind these partnerships with mentorship, access to resources, government
  relations, and global networks needed to scale their impact. The accelerator will
  take place in February 2018 in Washington, DC and participation in the program will
  be highly competitive.    <strong>WHO WE ARE</strong>    The U.S. Department of
  State’s Office of Global Partnerships is a center of excellence for collaboration
  between the U.S. Department of State, the public and private sectors, and civil
  society.  The Office aims to strengthen and deepen U.S. diplomacy and development
  around the world through partnerships that leverage the creativity, innovation,
  and core business resources of partners for greater impact.  The Department recognizes
  that it takes more than governments to address many global issues and believes that
  partnerships with the private sector, civil society, philanthropy and other non-governmental
  organizations are necessary for our national security and diplomacy objectives.
