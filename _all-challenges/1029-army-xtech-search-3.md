<p>In addition to the opportunity to showcase the participants&rsquo; technology with exhibit space and a 15-minute public presentation, Phase III participants will present an &ldquo;elevator pitch&rdquo; to a panel of Army subject matter experts at their exhibit space to summarize their Phase II Pitch on their technology concept, their team&rsquo;s ability, and a 6-month plan to conduct a live proof-of-concept demonstration if they were to proceed to Phase IV.&nbsp; (5 minute pitch followed by 10 minutes for questions and answers).&nbsp; Up to 12 small businesses with the highest ranking pitch and proof-of-concept demonstration plan will receive a prize of $120,000 and 6 months to demonstrate proof-of-concept for their xTechSearch technology at the Phase IV: xTechSearch Capstone Demonstration.</p>
<p>AUSA Innovators&rsquo; Corner Pitches will be ranked using the following Scoring Criteria (Scoring Criteria Guide found at the registration link):</p>
<ul>
<li>Phase II Results &ndash; 70%</li>
<li>Proof-of-Concept Demonstration Plan &ndash; 20%</li>
<li>Elevator Pitch &ndash; 10%</li>
</ul>

<h4>Phase IV: xTechSearch Capstone Demonstration</h4>
<p>The xTechSearch Capstone Demonstration is an opportunity for each Phase IV finalists to demonstrate proof-of-concept for their technology solution to a panel of Army subject matter experts and DoD leadership at the 2020 AUSA Global Force Symposium and Exposition, March 17-19, 2020, in Huntsville, AL.&nbsp; A single grand-prize winner will be selected for the technology concept with the greatest potential for impact to revolutionize the Army and be awarded a prize of $250,000.&nbsp; The eleven (11) other finalists will each receive a $10,000 prize.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Capstone Demonstrations will be ranked using the following Scoring Criteria (Scoring Criteria Guide found at the registration link):</p>
<ul>
