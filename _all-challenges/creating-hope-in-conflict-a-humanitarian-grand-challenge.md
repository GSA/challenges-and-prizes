  Process  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process for review of proposals
  for both seed and Transition to Scale funding includes an Eligibility Screen,
  Innovation Screen and Review Committee.</span>    <b>Eligibility Screen  </b><span
  style="font-weight: 400;">Grand Challenges Canada will screen applications and
  Letters of Intent on the basis of the eligibility criteria outlined in Section
  4.1. Applications that do not meet the eligibility criteria will be removed
  from the competition.</span>    <b>Innovation Screen  </b><span style="font-weight:
  400;">Seed applications/Transition To Scale Letters of Intent will be scored
  internally against the criteria below, using responses to application/Letter
  of Intent questions in the “Project Summary” section. The two criteria are equally
  weighted.</span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: The innovation screen
  will not evaluate the feasibility or quality of the project plan.</span><span
  style="font-weight: 400;"> (That evaluation will be done at a later stage in
  the process.) Proposals that lack innovation and relevance will be removed from
  the competition at this stage. </span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovation
  Screen criteria:</span>  <ol>    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Innovation</b>  <ul>    <li
  style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the proposed idea
  clearly articulated? </span></li>    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight:
  400;">Does the innovation represent more than an incremental improvement over
  current approaches?</span></li>  </ul>  </li>    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Relevance</b>  <ul>    <li
  style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does the proposed
  solution address the specific problem under the Humanitarian Grand Challenge,
  as described in Sections 2.1 and 2.2?</span></li>    <li style="font-weight:
  400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does the proposed solution target vulnerable
  people who are hard to reach and affected by conflict, as described in Section
  2.3?</span></li>  </ul>  </li>  </ol>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">At Transition
  To Scale level, the most promising Letters of Intent will be invited to submit
  a full Transition To Scale application for due diligence by the Review Committee.</span>    <b>Review
  Committee Screen  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">For proposals that pass
  the Eligibility and Innovation screens, a Review Committee of scientific, social
  and business reviewers, including humanitarian experts and affected people,
  will advise on the merit of proposals, based on the evaluation criteria in Sections
  4.4 and 4.5.</span>    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposals will be ranked
  in four lists, one for each area of interest outlined in Section 2.2. </span><span
  style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the quality of proposals received, </span><span
  style="font-weight: 400;">the Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners</span><span
  style="font-weight: 400;"> retain the right to narrow the focus to one or more
  of the four areas.</span>    <b>Transition To Scale Due Diligence  </b><span
  style="font-weight: 400;">Following review of Transition To Scale Letters of
  Intent,  those invited to submit full Transition To Scale proposals will undergo
  extensive due diligence on potential for impact, operations, finances, technical
  parameters, intellectual property, partnerships, gender equality, environment
  sustainability, and human rights and inclusion. (See Section 4.5 for full Transition
  to Scale evaluation criteria.) Due diligence may include interviews with applicants,
  partners, advisors and third-party stakeholders. </span>    <span style="font-weight:
  400;">Funding recommendations will be made based on findings from the extensive
  due diligence process. Grand Challenges Canada, on a case-by-case basis and
  in consultation with the Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners, may choose to
  recommend applicants who do not meet all the Investment Criteria for funding
  of a lesser amount to focus on a few key areas necessary to transition to scale.
  To inform final decision-making, Grand Challenges Canada will draft a recommendation
  that explains the rationale for funding and will work with the innovator to
  refine and structure the investment during the due diligence process. At its
  discretion, Grand Challenges Canada may choose not to put forward applicants
  for a funding decision, due to information that arises in due diligence or any
  perceived weaknesses based on the Investment Criteria.</span>    <b>Funding
  Decisions (Seed)  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the results of
  the review committee, the Humanitarian Grand Challenge Steering Committee will
  make a funding recommendation to the Board of Directors of Grand Challenges
  Canada, which will make the final funding decisions at the Board’s sole discretion,
  including its reserved rights set out in Section 4.13. Only projects rated as
  fundable by the Review Committee may be recommended for funding. Due diligence
  is taken into account for all projects recommended by Review Committee for funding.
  Based on the results of the Review Committee or due diligence process, refinements
  to the proposed project plan, structure, amount, type of funding and oversight
  may be required during the negotiation of a funding agreement.</span>    <b>Funding
  Decisions (Transition To Scale)  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final funding
  decisions are made by Grand Challenges Canada’s Board of Directors. Recommendations
  for funding to the Board of Directors are made by the </span><a href="http://www.grandchallenges.ca/who-we-are/our-people/"><span
  style="font-weight: 400;">Investment Committee</span></a><span style="font-weight:
  400;"> after review of staff recommendations (based on review of the application
  documents provided by the innovator and further due diligence) and other available
  information, such as brief interviews with the innovator.</span>  <h3><b>Evaluation

  style="font-weight: 400;">The solutions supported by this program comprise innovative
  technologies, services, business models, knowledge and/or products to promote
  humanitarian action in conflict-affected contexts. In order to ensure meaningful
  access for target populations, the successful development and deployment of
  these solutions may require involvement by, support of and/or collaboration
  with multiple organizations, including the private sector, government and academic
  and/or non-profit research institutions. Accordingly, it is the intent of this
  program to support the formation of appropriate partnerships that are essential
  to meet these urgent global health needs.</span>    <span style="font-weight:
  400;">Successful applicants retain ownership of intellectual property rights
  in supported innovations, including those rights that arise in outputs of funded
  projects. Grand Challenges Canada aims, however, to ensure that any such intellectual
  property rights are utilized and managed in a manner that is consistent with
  achieving the goals of this program. Grand Challenges Canada’s Global Access
  Policy will guide our approach to intellectual property, and we urge all applicants
  to consider their willingness to submit an application in compliance with Grand
  Challenges Canada’s Global Access Policy.</span>    <span style="font-weight:
  400;">Successful applicants will be required to commit to compliance with Grand
  Challenges Canada’s Global Access Policy and to sign a Global Access Agreement
  with Grand Challenges Canada, in line with the Guiding Principles, applicable
  to the innovative solutions and project outputs supported by this program. The
  Global Access Agreement will provide a non-exclusive license to intellectual
  property rights in supported innovations (including background intellectual
  property) permitting Grand Challenges Canada and its funding partners and its
  sub-licensees to implement and disseminate products, processes, knowledge or
  solutions in low- and middle-income countries in which applicants or their partners
  are unable to achieve meaningful accessibility. Applicants should note that
  Grand Challenges Canada may be required to provide sub-license or sub-distribution
  rights to the funding partners, or one or more persons appointed by the funding
  partners. Applicants should note that the above global access commitments survive
  the end of project activities.</span>    <b>Data Access  </b><span style="font-weight:

description: 'Today, over 136 million people require humanitarian assistance. Hundreds
  of thousands of the most vulnerable people in conflict zones are currently unreachable
  by traditional humanitarian aid delivery. As the length, frequency and scope of
  armed conflicts increase, it is progressively more difficult to reach affected people
  in insecure areas with life-saving and life-improving humanitarian assistance.    International
  aid agencies face challenges in delivering humanitarian aid in conflict-affected
  contexts, including damaged infrastructure, aid diversion, corruption and threats
  of violence. Local responders are often better placed to reach affected people in
  insecure settings, but lack the funding or resources, or the capacity to provide
  aid in hard-to-reach places.    As the scale of humanitarian emergencies continues
  to grow at a rate that surpasses the capacity of any one partner or sector to respond,
  new ways of thinking and working together are imperative. Engagement with the private
  sector is essential in developing new approaches to complement traditional ways
  of delivering humanitarian aid. The private sector is often uniquely effective at
  scaling sustainable solutions and in improving the speed, quality and cost-efficiency
  of delivering or manufacturing commodities and utilities, recycling products and
  financing or developing innovative solutions.    To improve assistance in conflict-generated
  crises, the United States Agency for International Development Office of U.S. Foreign
  Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA), the UK Department for International Development
  (DFID), and Grand Challenges Canada have launched Creating Hope in Conflict: A Humanitarian
  Grand Challenge.    <strong>THE GRAND CHALLENGE</strong>  We seek life-saving or
  life-improving innovations to help the most vulnerable and hardest-to-reach people
  impacted by humanitarian crises caused by conflict. These innovations will involve
  a connection to the private sector and input from affected communities in order
  to provide, supply, or locally generate safe drinking water and sanitation, energy,
  life-saving information, or health supplies and services to help conflict-affected
  people.    <strong>AREAS OF FOCUS</strong>  The Humanitarian Grand Challenge is
  focused on addressing the most acute needs in conflict-affected areas that have
  the potential to be solved by innovation in one or more of the following four areas:
  (1) safe water and sanitation; (2) energy; (3) life-saving information; or (4) health
  supplies and services. Innovations must enable local solutions, serve local needs
  and delivery gaps, overcome common delivery barriers in conflict settings, or improve
  on the timeliness and cost efficiency of current humanitarian delivery methods.
  The focus areas are described in detail below.    <em><strong>Safe Water and Sanitation</strong></em>  <span
  style="text-decoration: underline;">Roadblock</span>: Lack of safe water sources
  and sanitation in conflict settings.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Context</span>:
  Approximately 53.5 million people in the world’s most challenging humanitarian emergencies
  require safe water and sanitation. Adequate access to safe water and basic sanitation
  is critical to prevent skin disease and waterborne diseases; for example, diarrheal
  diseases, which is the second leading cause of death globally for children under
  five, with 88% of deaths attributable to inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene.
  Yet, managing the spread of diseases in conflict is made particularly difficult
  by the disruption or destruction of existing waste management, water treatment and
  distribution systems. People who are displaced by conflict are often at a higher
  risk of infection by waterborne pathogens because of the resulting poor and crowded
  living conditions, combined with poor nutrition and limited healthcare.    We invite
  bold ideas, technologies, processes and approaches that enable rapid provision of
  safe water and safe disposal of waste and sewage in the most vulnerable households
  and/or enable implementers to rapidly scale up programs.    <strong><em>Energy</em></strong>  <span
  style="text-decoration: underline;">Roadblock</span>: A lack of reliable, accessible
  and sustainable electricity options in conflict settings.  Context: It is estimated
  that 83 million people in the world’s most challenging humanitarian emergencies
  are without access to electricity. Currently, much of the electricity in conflict
  zones comes from generators and is therefore reliant on diesel, which needs costly
  and difficult transportation, and can also be diverted to fuel weapons of war. Electricity
  is needed to run:  <ul>    <li>Health services, such as lighting for surgery, dialysis
  machines and oxygen manufacturing</li>    <li>Water pumping and purification</li>    <li>Household
  needs</li>    <li>Information and communications systems</li>  </ul>  We invite
  bold ideas to generate energy. We are particularly interested in alternative energy
  solutions that are possible to set up and maintain in conflict situations to power
  life-saving and life-improving services, such as health, information, water and
  sanitation, and education.    <strong><em>Life-saving Information</em></strong>  <span
  style="text-decoration: underline;">Roadblock</span>: Conflict impedes access to
  vital information at three levels: among members of affected populations, among
  humanitarian organizations, and between humanitarian organizations and affected
  people.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Context</span>: Information exchange
  modalities are disrupted or deliberately targeted by armed actors. With disrupted
  communications and transportation infrastructure, critical information is difficult
  to gather, communicate and analyze, which denies affected populations the ability
  to meet their needs locally or to safely connect with humanitarian actors to receive
  assistance. Delivery of appropriate humanitarian assistance risks delay or failure
  when information on local conditions is incomplete, outdated or faulty.    We are
  looking for bold ideas that use and improve access to information and data to increase
  the impact of humanitarian assistance at the local level, as well as to enable more
  effective connections for affected populations and humanitarian actors.    <strong><em>Health
  Supplies and Services</em></strong>  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Roadblock</span>:
  Lack of sufficient and effective medical supplies and services in conflict.    <span
  style="text-decoration: underline;">Context</span>: In the most challenging conflict-affected
  humanitarian emergencies globally, approximately 44.7 million people lack basic
  access to medical care. Supply chain disruptions, such as blockades, attacks on
  humanitarian workers and sieges, make it difficult to import and distribute necessary
  health supplies. Additionally, health facilities are left without highly skilled
  staff and lack access to essential medical supplies and services.    We are looking
  for bold solutions that:  <ul>    <li>Enable non-expert people to provide quality
  care</li>    <li>Empower skilled staff who choose to work in conflict zones</li>    <li>Allow
  faster or less costly importation and distribution of quality essential health supplies
  in conflict zones</li>    <li>Enable affected communities to manufacture necessary
  high-quality and safe supplies, or to sterilize and reuse them.</li>  </ul>  Depending
  on the quality of proposals received, the Humanitarian Grand Challenge retains the
  right to narrow the focus to one or more of the above areas. Proposals that address
  more than one sector are very welcome.    <strong>MEETING THE NEEDS OF AFFECTED
  POPULATIONS</strong>  The Humanitarian Grand Challenge is focused on helping people
  who are hardest-to-reach as a result of conflict-generated humanitarian emergencies.
  The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA)
  provides examples of some of the most challenging current humanitarian crises: <a
  href="https://www.unocha.org/where-we-work/current-emergencies" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">https://www.unocha.org/where-we-work/current-emergencies</a>. We
  will also consider innovations that are focused on reaching people affected by natural
  disasters, but they must also be relevant in conflict-generated emergencies.    We
  encourage innovations that focus on people who are socially marginalized because
  of their gender, sex, sexuality, religion, age or income, as well as people with
  disabilities, minorities and people who are stateless.    <strong>AVAILABLE FUNDING</strong>    <span
  style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Seed Funding</em></span>  The objective
  of seed funding is to test new ideas and approaches to humanitarian assistance,
  to determine whether or not they are effective. By the end of the funding period,
  projects that receive seed funding are expected to demonstrate evidence (e.g., proof
  of concept), in a controlled or limited setting, that there is greater assistance
  in the target region, lower reliance on importations, and/or reduction of other
  significant barrier(s) to obtaining assistance as a result of the project, as well
  as that the innovation has the potential to be implemented at scale in other contexts.    Through
  this Request for Proposals, the Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners will award
  seed funding of up to $250,000 CAD per project over a maximum of twenty-four (24)
  months. In addition to award funding, awardees may receive additional support, such
  as publicity and marketing promotional support; access to exclusive industry, investor
  and partner networking events; and basic acceleration support, mentorship opportunities
  and partnership brokering.    The level of funding requested should be sufficient
  to assure completion of the goals in the stated time frame and must be fully justified.    We
  expect to award 10–15 seed grants through this Request for Proposals. At the end
  of the seed funding stage, if having achieved proof of concept, innovations may
  be invited to apply to the transition-to-scale funding track.    To receive seed
  funding, applicants must demonstrate potential relevance to or identify potential
  opportunities for collaboration with the private sector.    <span style="text-decoration:
  underline;"><em>Transition to Scale (TTS) Funding</em></span>  Strategic partnerships
  are required for the transition to scale and sustainability of innovative solutions.    Matched
  funding (cash) from strategic partners for activities that further the growth, development,
  commercialization or adoption of the innovation (e.g., manufacturing, distribution,
  marketing, networks) will be interpreted as an increased commitment by a partner.
  Most awardees will be required to secure a 1:1 match within the TTS funding period;
  however, this will be assessed on a case-by-case basis during the due diligence
  process. Strategic partners may provide human and other non-financial resources
  to the project activities; however, awardees are not allowed to rely only upon these
  types of in-kind contributions to meet the matching requirements.    Through this
  Request for Proposals, the Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners will award Transition
  To Scale funding of up to $1,000,000 CAD per project over a maximum of twenty-four
  (24) months. The level of funding requested should be sufficient to assure completion
  of the goals in the stated timeframe and must be fully justified.    We expect to
  invest in two to four Transition to Scale projects; they may be grants, repayable
  grants, interest-free loans, interest-bearing loans, convertible debt, pay-on-results
  contracts or a combination thereof. The choice of investment structure is informed
  by (i) the organization’s stage and path to scale (e.g., for-profit or non-profit),
  (ii) the structure’s ability to attract additional sources of capital, including
  private partners, as follow-on investors, (iii) the potential effect on the intervention’s
  impact and on the organization’s sustainability, including its ability to become
  self-sustaining, (iv) the desire to encourage return of funds when investments scale
  successfully and profitably.    The Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners will support
  networking of funded innovators with private sector, humanitarian actors and other
  stakeholders to increase the likelihood of success. Technical and advisory support
  may be provided to nurture the scalability and sustainability of humanitarian innovations.
  In addition, awardees may receive additional support, such as publicity and marketing
  promotional support; access to exclusive industry, investor and partner networking
  events; and basic acceleration support, mentorship opportunities and partnership
  brokering.    The provision of funds to innovators is subject to the release of
  funds to Grand Challenges Canada from our funder(s).    <strong>FOCUS ON RESULTS</strong>  The
  ultimate outcomes of interest for this Humanitarian Grand Challenge are lives saved
  and lives improved of conflict-affected people. Other qualitative and quantitative
  results should be collected to best demonstrate the impact of the innovation.    Given
  that the true impact of innovations is in the future, proposals must include a plan
  of how relevant immediate and intermediate indicators will be monitored and evaluated
  over the life of the project.    For innovations that are not successful, it is
  expected innovators will be able to articulate why they did not work, in order to
  accelerate progress in the sector. Dependent on funding, we aim to bring successful
  innovators together to share lessons learned and ideas.    <strong>COMMUNICATING
  RESULTS</strong>  Communicating results is an important part of the project’s accountability
  to the Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners and other key stakeholders. Innovators
  should consider how results will be disseminated in order to drive the innovation’s
  impact, scale and sustainability. While communicating results through scientific
  publications can be an effective, this should not be the primary objective of projects.
  For more information see Appendix A.    <strong>ROLE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR</strong>  Given
  the current scale of humanitarian needs, this challenge is too great for one sector
  to solve alone. Private sector approaches to testing, effectively scaling sustainable
  solutions, improving the speed, quality and cost-efficiency of manufacturing commodities
  and utilities, recycling products and  financing innovative solutions can result
  in more effective and impactful solutions. The private sector can contribute valuable
  technical expertise, risk management, and access to networks and data, and may often
  have detailed knowledge about local conditions. For instance, small local businesses
  are often critical in providing life-saving and life-improving commodities in the
  wake of armed conflict.    Innovators are encouraged to engage the core competencies
  of the private sector into their design or partner with the private sector in order
  to maximize the impact of their innovations. To receive seed funding, applicants
  must demonstrate potential relevance to, or identify potential opportunities for
  collaboration with, the private sector. To receive transition-to-scale funding,
  engagement with the private sector is required.    Innovators are expected to engage
  private sector actors who can help to fill a critical gap needed to scale or improve
  their innovation. This may include technical expertise, distribution channels, access
  to data, local knowledge, financial backing, or other core capacities or collaboration.
  In some circumstances, the Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners may be able to
  assist in finding appropriate private sector partners, as long as applicants are
  able to articulate their needs. Though it is strongly preferred, secured commitment
  of private sector engagement are not required at the time of application.    The
  private sector is defined as for-profit entities at the local, national or multinational
  level, and refers to the following organizations and actors:  <ul>    <li>Private
  for-profit entities, such as a business, corporation, or private firms</li>    <li>Private
  equity or private financial institutions, including private investment firms, mutual
  funds or insurance companies</li>    <li>Private investors (individuals or groups)</li>    <li>Private
  business or industry associations, including but not limited to chambers of commerce
  and related types of entities</li>    <li>Private grant-making foundations or philanthropic
  entities.</li>  </ul>  Inclusion of the private sector in applications may be either
  through financial or in-kind engagement, or collaboration.    Private sector entities
  are also encouraged to apply for funding.    <strong>INTEGRATED INNOVATION</strong>  Projects
  are expected to take an Integrated Innovation® approach, defined as the coordinated
  application of scientific/technological, social and business innovation, to develop
  solutions to complex challenges. This approach does not discount the singular benefits
  of each of these types of innovation alone, but rather highlights the powerful synergies
  that can be realized by aligning all three. For more info, please see: <a href="http://www.grandchallenges.ca/funding-opportunities/integratedinnovation/"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.grandchallenges.ca/funding-opportunities/integratedinnovation/</a>.    <strong>SCALE
  AND SUSTAINABILITY</strong>  For the Humanitarian Grand Challenge, sustainability
  refers to the ability for successful innovations to be readily deployed in ongoing
  and future contexts, and scale refers to the ability for successful innovations
  to reach the highest number of people who will benefit as possible. Proposals should
  convincingly describe how their projects will eventually reach scale and be sustained.
  Innovators should use seed funding to test paths to scale and sustainability, and
  must have a robust plan and proven concept in order to receive transition-to-scale
  funding.    Transition To Scale applicants must already have developed a strong
  plan for scale and sustainability, including commitments from key stakeholders and
  partners needed to proceed along a path to scale and sustainability.    <span style="text-decoration:
  underline;"><em>Understanding of Conflict-Generated Crises</em></span>  To help
  ensure sustainable impact at scale, it is essential that project teams include individuals
  with an understanding of the local social, political and economic context. In doing
  so, projects can better address the needs of affected people and identify risks
  to project success.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Stakeholder
  Engagement</em></span>  People affected by conflict and those who will ultimately
  make decisions about the use of the solution, such as humanitarian agencies (local,
  national or international), United Nations agencies, Red Cross entities or non-traditional
  responders (faith-based groups, local community groups) are expected be engaged
  at the outset and throughout the life of the project. Input and engagement of these
  types of organizations throughout the project lifecycle is crucial, as they will
  be involved in the evaluation process. This will help to ensure that the solution
  will be poised for initial adoption and subsequent adaptation, leading to greater
  impact. Additionally, stakeholders can offer insight on their community and identify
  the factors necessary for project success.    <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY,
  GENDER EQUALITY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND </strong><strong>INCLUSION</strong>  Innovators
  funded under this Humanitarian Grand Challenge must comply with Grand Challenges
  Canada’s policies on Environmental Sustainability, Gender Equality, Human Rights
  and Inclusion. Environmental Sustainability Applicants are required to commit to
  ensuring that the innovation will not have material adverse environmental effects,
  including but not limited to long-term and cumulative effects. Where possible, innovators
  should incorporate having positive environmental effects throughout the project.    <span
  style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Gender Equality</em></span>  The Humanitarian
  Grand Challenge partners are committed to furthering principles of gender equality
  in the projects funded, with the following objectives: (1) advancing women''s equal
  participation with men as decision-makers in shaping the sustainable development
  of their societies; (2) supporting women and girls in the realization of their full
  human rights; and (3) reducing gender inequalities. Female applicants are strongly
  encouraged to apply.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Human Rights
  and Inclusion</em></span>  The Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners are committed
  to furthering principles of human rights and inclusion in the innovations funded.
  Innovations should take into account the voices of those who are particularly marginalized
  in the design and implementation of the innovation, to ensure that their needs are
  addressed appropriately.    <strong>GLOBAL ACCESS, DATA ACCESS AND ETHICS</strong>  The
  Humanitarian Grand Challenge partners are committed to fostering meaningful access
  to supported innovations for the target population of each funded project, promoting
  prompt and open dissemination of research findings and data arising from funded
  activities, and ensuring that funded research is conducted in a manner that complies
  with relevant ethical standards. These commitments are embodied in Grand Challenges
  Canada’s Global Access Policy, Data Access Policy and Ethics Policy, which should
  be carefully reviewed by all applicants before submission.    <strong>RISK MANAGEMENT,
  SAFETY, ANTI-TERRORISM, ANTI-CORRUPTION, ANTI-BRIBERY</strong>  Proposals will need
  to comply with all relevant U.S. and Canadian legislation, including anti-bribery
  and anti-terrorism legislation. Funding will not be given to any person or organisation
  named in US, UK, European Union, World Bank, Canadian, or United Nations Security
  Council sanctions; we may add to this list as more partners join the challenge.
  All innovators are expected to manage material risks. For projects that include
  work in insecure locations, proposals will require details about the management
  of safety and security risks as they pertain to both people and assets. Proposals
  must also explain how corruption will be avoided, and what steps will be taken to
  avoid diversion of aid away from affected people.    <strong>WHAT WE WILL NOT FUND</strong>  <ol>    <li>Formal
  education</li>    <li>Approaches that utilize security-related surveillance, weapons,
  force or similar technologies</li>    <li>Discovery science, merely capacity-building
  initiatives, ongoing programmatic funding or infrastructure development</li>    <li>Projects
  that involve establishing proof of concept of innovations for which the core intellectual
  property rights are owned by a third-party institution, unless either: (a) the third-party
  institution has granted the applicant sufficient license rights to the innovation
  to permit eventual scaling in relevant countries, or (b) the third-party institution
  is willing to sign an undertaking to Grand Challenges Canada committing to comply
  with Grand Challenges Canada’s Global Access Policy: <a href="http://www.grandchallenges.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Global-AccessPolicy_25May2016_EN.pdf"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.grandchallenges.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Global-AccessPolicy_25May2016_EN.pdf</a>.</li>  </ol>  All
  criteria are subject to change as new funders join the challenge; updates will be
  published on the “Frequently Asked Questions” section of the Humanitarian Grand
  Challenge website.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Activities and
  Deliverables</em></span>  Innovators funded under this program will be expected
  to engage in the following activities and provide the specific deliverables listed
  below, in order to demonstrate project progress and success:  <ol>    <li>Performance
  reporting focused on utilization of funds and outcomes achieved. The frequency of
