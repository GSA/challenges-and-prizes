  ### Video Message From AHRQ Director Gopal Khanna About Entering the Step Up
  App Challenge




  **\*\****Miss the Step Up App Challenge: Phase 1 Informational Webinar?**[Check out the slides presented during the August 23 webinar](https://www.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/stepup_Challenge/step-up-challenge-phase-1-webinar-slides.pdf)\*\****




  #### **The Background**


  Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are vital to understanding the complex needs of a patient. For this challenge, PRO data are defined as “any report of the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient, without interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or other medical expert.” In other words, PRO data come from patient self-assessments and look beyond the clinical data to assess how a patient feels about his or her health.


  #### **The Problem**


  While PRO data have proven useful to healthcare providers, they are not widely used in clinical settings. Recently, some digital tools have been developed to streamline the collection of PRO data. However, those digital tools are not widely adopted due to challenges related to clinician workflow and patient ease with the tools. Also, researchers who want to analyze PRO data across different practices or health systems often encounter the issue that data are not collected in a standardized manner. Creating a digital tool to efficiently collect, aggregate, and share PRO data is critical to advancing the quality of care.


  #### **Phase 1 Winners**


  The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Step Up App Challenge is seeking innovative technologists to develop user-friendly apps that collect standardized PRO data for clinical and research purposes.


  **Phase 1 winners announced:**


  **AgilisIT:** AgilisITTM's solution focuses on patient engagement, ease of use for physicians, and EHR integration in order to encourage the digital collection of PRO data. The patient centered app offers both mobile and web applications, enabling patients to receive reminders and track their own progress while providers can receive patient health notifications and easily review data to prepare treatment plans based on patient priorities.


  **Asymmetrik:** Asymmetrik’s Phoenix Integration PlatformTMallows healthcare providers to use FHIR®to leverage existing investments in data infrastructure, simplify data analytics to make informed decisions across health systems, and deploy secure, data-driven applications for researchers, doctors, and patients. Built on the award-winning Phoenix ServerTM, Asymmetrik’s patient engagement solution can help healthcare providers improve patient engagement and care coordination by exchanging PRO data with patients, targeting patients with low response rates or certain medical conditions, and analyzing responses in real time.


  **Booz Allen Hamilton:** DEXi Care MapTMis an application designed to allow patients to interact directly with their providers including inputs from wearables, and has an easy-to-understand interface viewable to both the patient and provider that tracks progress. Using a combination of artificial intelligence (AI), machine intelligence (MI), and natural language processing (NLP), DEXi Care Map can provide tailored information to patients and providers and is able to parse user input and feedback into structured data.


  **Health Wizz:** The Health WizzTMsolution incentivizes patients to provide sought after data through "Campaigns" (e.g., Chronic Disease Management Campaign, Patient Reported Outcome Campaign, etc.). Participants can choose to accept Campaign invitations and can receive rewards for participation. The data can be entered and tracked on the patient's mobile device or wearable and can be transferred into an EHR system accessible to clinicians.


  **1upHealth:** ProUpTMis a secure, patient facing application developed by 1upHealth that facilitates seamless integration between EHR systems and PRO data collected via easy to complete PRO questionnaires.


  **Qidza Inc:** Qidza's ProNogginTMmobile app is designed to improve the collection of PRO data by addressing health literacy gaps via simple designs, increasing patient engagement via personalization, and improving data aggregation and sharing via FHIR integration.

  **PEER Technologies, PLLC:** PEER Technologies utilizes the Shared Decision Making (SDM) process between patients and providers in a user-friendly application that strives to improve patient knowledge and satisfaction through producing benchmarked PRO scores for patients and risk/benefit evaluation when discussing surgery. Patients easily enter PRO data regarding non-specific low back pain and are presented with comprehendible recommendations including personalized estimates of normative outcomes based on patients’ age, sex and other features.


  **PRISM:** PRISMTMis an application developed by a multi-disciplinary team that enhances the quality of clinical discussion between healthcare providers and patients by providing the option for patients to fill out PRO questions before or during office visits via a mobile application or web site. Patients can compare their health trends to the overall population while providers and healthcare organizations have access to the PRO data from within the EHR. Providers have the ability to send individual reminders to patients and they can use dashboards to track population trends and patient response rates.


  **Social & Scientific Systems PatientPort:** PatientPortTMis a secure, patient-centric application leveraging a user-friendly interface to maximize engagement. The application is built to provide interoperability with user devices, regardless of operating system and can be integrated with commercially available EHR products to promote adoption by both health systems and patients.


  The ten Phase 1 winners will now move to Phase 2 Development. The teams will compete for $35,000 for the first place winner, $30,000 for the second place winner, and $25,000 for the third place winner.

<p><strong>Overview of Phase 2 &ndash; Development</strong></p>
<p>Phase 1 winners will advance to Phase 2 focused on developing the application using the FHIR technical specifications and PROMIS&reg; resources provided by AHRQ. The application should have the capability to do CATs which requires the device to be connected with a server for real-time question calling and scoring (online administration). Participants can use the <strong><a href="http://www.healthmeasures.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=170&amp;Itemid=1138">Assessment Center Application Programming Interface</a></strong> (API) to build an application that enables CAT. In addition to CAT, participants are highly encouraged to also include the capability to administer the selected PROMIS&reg; short form v1.0 &ndash; Physical Function 10a (offline administration). Below are the references to PROMIS&reg; API, CAT, and selected short form. A webinar on how to use the PROMIS&reg; API will be held at the beginning of Phase 2.</p>
<p>Register for credentials to use the API: <strong><a href="https://protect2.fireeye.com/url?k=908ee238d02fcffe.908ed307-f175b956c34155c8&amp;u=https://www.assessmentcenter.net/ac_api">https://www.assessmentcenter.net/ac_api</a></strong></p>
<p>Documentation on how to administer PROMIS&reg; items using the API: <strong><a href="https://www.assessmentcenter.net/ac_api/2012-01/Docs/API_tech_walkthrough.docx">https://www.assessmentcenter.net/ac_api/2012-01/Docs/API_tech_walkthrough.docx</a></strong></p>
<p>The goal of Phase 2 is to present a viable application to collect standardized PRO data in ambulatory care settings including both primary care and specialty care practices. Participants need to demonstrate that the app could export standardized data which would facilitate future data integration into an EHR or IT system. Participants are required to undertake user testing of the application during Phase 2. Participants must provide evidence of testing with at least five people. A larger amount of time spent with each tester, greater formal rigor, and the number and diversity of people used for testing will result in a more positive assessment under the judging criteria. Evidence demonstrating user testing could include sample feedback, quotes, or pictures, and should include how it affected the development of the application.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Phase 2 Submission Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The application must be submitted by the deadline, February 15, 2019, in PDF format. The submission should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation plan (up to 10 pages):
<ul>
<li>Describe key activities and resources required to deploy and pilot the application.</li>
<li>Refine and incorporate relevant information from business case submission in Phase 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provide evidence of user testing including how it affected the application development (up to 5 pages).</li>
<li>Provide completed Attestation Questionnaire along with a trace log.</li>
<li>Apps must incorporate the following usability, functionality, and technical requirements:
<ul>
<li>Computerized adaptive testing (CAT).</li>
<li>One or two samples of using the Assessment Center API to do CAT.</li>

<li>Simple design, easy navigation, and intuitive to use.</li>
<li>Personalized content.</li>
<li><strong>Not</strong> connected with any social media applications.</li>
<li><strong>HIPAA compliance if applicable.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Apps must employ the following device-based security ONLY if the developer chooses to store ANY patient data on the device (username, password, or Face ID are not considered as patient data):
<ul>
<li>The PRO data must be encrypted at rest, even when the device is unlocked.</li>
<li>Follow specifications and current recommendations for AES-256 bit encryption.</li>
<li>The key must be saved in the Keychain or SharedPreferences for iOS and Android respectively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Authorization Protocol:
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate the authorization protocol by using the "OAuth 2.0 Username and Password Grant Flow" and HL7 patient-facing app standalone launch sequence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data communication:
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate the ability to represent the collected PRO data as either JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or Extensible Markup Language (XML).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Technical ability to do video demonstration of the application via video demonstration to display the application&rsquo;s device and data security, usability, accessibility, ease of data collection and HIPAA compliance if applicable.</li>
<li>Export and deposit standardized PRO data to a FTP site selected by AHRQ.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overview of Phase 3 &ndash; Pilot Test</strong></p>
<p>The final phase will involve pilot testing the application in &ldquo;real-life&rdquo; clinical settings. The grand prize winner in Phase 2 is required to collaborate with MedStar Health to pilot test the application in nine practice settings in the District/Maryland/Virginia area. If the grand prize winner cannot be at the pilot sites physically, MedStar could facilitate remote access for the collaboration. There will be a mix of primary care and specialty care practices. The goal of Phase 3 is to assess the usability of the application. This phase will also test the feasibility of implementation, the scalability of the application, and acceptance by stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Phase 3 Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work with MedStar Health on the pilot test including setting up the IT infrastructure, modifying the application if needed, and troubleshooting issues during data collection
<ul>
