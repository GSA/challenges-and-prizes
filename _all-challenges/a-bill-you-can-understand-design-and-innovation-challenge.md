description: '<p>This Challenge engages those in the health care community working on
  these issues, as well as new players from other industries, such as human-centered
  design and digital tech, to help in redesigning the “Medical Bill” or the “Medical
  Billing Process.” </p><p>   “A Bill You Can Understand” design and innovation challenge
  will invite participants to design a medical bill that is easier to understand,
  as well as reinvent cost of care estimation and the medical billing journey with
  the goal of improving the patient financial experience. Participants will be asked
  to submit entries that improve both the design of the medical bill and patient experience
  of the medical billing process. Submissions will include the (1) design concept
  for the redesigned medical bill, (2) journey map or wireframe for the redesigned
  patient experience, (3) written explanation of submission, and (3) video explanation
  of submission. </p><p>Specific criteria for the written and video explanations will be
  provided on the Challenge Website.  These may include but are not limited to explaining
  how the redesign will better empower patients to understand the financial information
  provided on their medical bill and take appropriate action and vision for an improved
  patient financial experience.</p><p>  The challenge is sponsored by AARP, administrated
  by Mad*Pow, an experience design agency, and organized in collaboration with HHS.    Two
  winning contestants will be selected for the following prizes:  <ul>   <li><u>Prize
  1 – $5000</u>: Most Improved Medical Bill Design (Focusing on the design of the
  bill itself).</li>   <li><u>Prize 2 – $5000</u>: Transformational Approach to Medical
  Cost Estimation and Billing Process (Focusing on what the patient sees and does
  throughout the process).</li>  </ul></p>'
