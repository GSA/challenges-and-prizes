  of the Prize</strong>    NEH will award winning entries $5,000 for First Prize,
  $3,000 for Second Prize, and $2,000 for Third Prize.  NEH may award up to three
  separate K-12 Student Prizes of $1,000 each.  In addition to cash prizes, NEH
  will invite the winners of the competition to NEH in Washington, D.C., to present
  their work at the National Digital Newspaper Program Annual Meeting and to be
  honored at the <em>Chronicling America</em> reception given by NEH in September,
  2016.  NEH will reimburse winners up to $1,500 for authorized travel expenses.
   For winning team entries, NEH will reimburse travel expenses for only one person
  from the team. This person will be the contact person listed on the entry form.
  If this person is not available, he or she must designate a replacement from
  the team. Only persons listed on the original entry form may have their travel
  expenses reimbursed by NEH.  All other persons accompanying the winner/team
  representative must arrange and fund their own travel and accommodations.  Awards
  and travel expense reimbursements may be subject to federal income taxes, and
  NEH will comply with the Internal Revenue Service withholding and reporting
  requirements, where applicable.    <strong>Basis upon which Winner Will Be Selected</strong>    NEH
  staff will review entries, and will send the top submissions to a panel of expert
  judges.  NEH will select a judging panel consisting of three outside experts,
  chosen for their achievements in the humanities and digital humanities.  Judges
  will be fair and impartial. A judge may not have a familial or financial relationship
  with an individual who is a registered contestant in the competition. Judges
  will fully comply with all applicable government ethics requirements for federal
  employees.    NEH staff and judges will use the following criteria to judge
  the submitted entries:  <ol>    <li>Strong humanities content. Entries must
  address a subject or idea in the humanities.  NEH interprets the humanities
  broadly, including history, language, linguistics, literature, jurisprudence,
  philosophy, archaeology, comparative religion, ethics, art history, and the
  humanistic social sciences.</li>    <li>Impact and use of data. NEH will judge
  entries on creative selection of data, exploration of questions in the humanities
  for which big data provides insight, and/or innovative techniques for data use.
   Entries should uncover trends, display insights, explore a theme, or tell a
  story.</li>    <li>While entrants are welcome to use existing software or tools,
  as well as other datasets, to create their projects, NEH will judge entries
  on originality, meaning the novelty of approach using data to address a humanities
  theme.</li>    <li>User appeal and clarity. Because NEH and the Library of Congress
  will promote winning entries to showcase the many uses for <em>Chronicling America</em>
  data, projects should be easily understood by a general public audience.</li>  </ol>  The
  judging panel will judge the submissions to advise representatives of NEH, who
  will choose the final winning entries.  All judging will take place between
  on or about June 15, 2016, and on or about July 15, 2016.  For questions or
  further information, please see the contact information listed above.'

description: '<strong>***Please note that all challenge submissions will be hidden
  until they are evaluated following the submissions close date.*** </strong>    <strong>How
  can you use open data to explore history?  </strong>NEH invites members of the public
  to produce creative web-based projects demonstrating the potential for using the
  data found in the <em>Chronicling America</em> website, available at <span style="text-decoration:
  underline;"><a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov">http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov</a></span>.
   <em>Chronicling America</em> is a website providing access to digitized U.S. newspapers
  and to information about historic newspapers.  The National Digital Newspaper Program
  (NDNP), a joint effort between NEH and the Library of Congress, produces the site. 
  Visit the <em>Chronicling America</em> website at <span style="text-decoration:
  underline;"><a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov">http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov</a></span>. 
  For more about the humanities, visit the NEH website at <span style="text-decoration:
  underline;"><a href="http://www.neh.gov">www.neh.gov</a></span>.    <strong>What
  are we looking for?</strong>  NEH encourages contestants to develop data visualizations,
  web-based tools, or other innovative and interesting web-based projects using the
  open data found in <em>Chronicling America</em>.  There are over ten million pages
  of digitized newspapers in <em>Chronicling America</em>, published between 1836
  and 1922, from towns and cities across the United States.  The newspapers illuminate
  19<sup>th-</sup> and 20<sup>th-</sup>century American life, with stories about politics,
  sports, shopping, music, food, health, science, movies, and everything in between. 
  Entries should uncover trends, display insights, explore a theme, or tell a story.    For
  example, entries using the <em>Chronicling America</em> newspaper data could:  <ul>    <li>Show
  how local news in various places covered the World Series of baseball</li>    <li>Trace
  the developing motion picture industry across the country</li>    <li>Follow the
  enactment of amendments to the Constitution</li>    <li>Show coverage of a historic
  political campaign in various locations</li>    <li>Map the travels of a president
  across the country based on local news coverage</li>    <li>Show changes in advertising
  logos or newspaper mastheads over time</li>    <li>Track the price or adoption of
  consumer goods over time in different locations</li>    <li>Explore tourism in different
  locations in the United States</li>    <li>Discover how various regions of the country
  celebrated Thanksgiving at different times</li>  </ul>  Projects could also create
  data mashups that juxtapose <em>Chronicling America</em> data with other datasets
  or translate newspapers into different languages.    The Library of Congress has
  developed a user-friendly Application Program Interface (API), which can be used
  to explore the data contained in <em>Chronicling America</em> in many ways.  You
  can learn more about the API at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api">http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api</a></span>. 
  Entrants must use this API to access the data, but are welcome to use existing software
  or tools to create their projects.    <strong>Amount of the Prize</strong>    NEH
  will award winning entries $5,000 for First Prize, $3,000 for Second Prize, and
  $2,000 for Third Prize.  NEH may award up to three separate K-12 Student Prizes
  of $1,000 each.  In addition to cash prizes, NEH will invite the winners of the
  competition to NEH in Washington, D.C., to present their work at the National Digital
  Newspaper Program Annual Meeting and to be honored at the <em>Chronicling America</em>
  reception given by NEH in September, 2016.  Please see Rules for more details on
  prizes.'
