description: "<p><span lang=\"EN\">The majority of U.S. fossil fuel-fired electricity
  generating units submit quarterly reports on their hourly nitrogen oxides (NOX),
  sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions along with select operating
  parameters (e.g., hourly heat input, gross electricity generation). EPA&rsquo;s
  Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) makes these data available through a variety of
  online reports and applications. Information about CAMD data can be found in the
  Plain English Guide to Part 75.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">CAMD is looking
  to academic and research institutions to propose practical and replicable projects
  that benefit academic institutions, the environment, and the public.</span></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">Submissions for innovative and creative uses of CAMD data should advance
  the knowledge, use, and understanding of CAMD data and related information, with
  priority on the following possible project themes:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><span
  lang=\"EN\">Analyzing emission data</span></strong><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>:</strong>
  Answer timely and relevant research questions using CAMD data</span></li>\r\n<li><strong>Enhancing
  communications</strong><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>:</strong> Design new and innovative
  ways (e.g., data visualizations) to present CAMD data to the public</span></li>\r\n<li><strong>Developing
  technology and data mashups</strong><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>:</strong> Develop
  new technologies or analytic methods to integrate CAMD data with other datasets
  to unlock the broader potential of CAMD data</span></li>\r\n<li><strong>Promoting
  environmental education</strong><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>:</strong> Explore opportunities
  to use CAMD data in high school or university classrooms</span></li>\r\n<li><strong>Improving
