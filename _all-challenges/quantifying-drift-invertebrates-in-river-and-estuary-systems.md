description: '<strong>We are seeking a way to economically detect, count, and identify
  food resources available to critical fish species targeted for recovery and protection
  in river and estuary systems. </strong>    <strong>Enter the competition: <a href="http://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933647">www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933647</a></strong>   <p> Habitat
  restoration, improvement, and creation in rivers, streams, and estuaries are key
  elements for the recovery of salmon, trout, and other critical fish species in the
  United States. Millions of dollars are spent annually on activities such as manipulating
  flow regimes, adding structural elements such as wood or rock, reconnecting rivers
  with their floodplains, and restoring wetlands. A critical aspect in evaluating
  the effectiveness of these habitat manipulations is understanding how they influence
  the food resources available to critical fish species targeted for recovery and
  protection. Yet despite its importance, quantification of food resources has proven
  difficult. </p><p>   The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with other federal agencies
  (NOAA-National Marine Fisheries Service, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Fish and Wildlife
  Service, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) is seeking a way to economically detect,
  count, and identify zooplankton and drift invertebrates in river and estuary systems.
  Problems identified that prevent the simple transfer of oceanographic techniques
  to rivers and streams are higher water velocities, turbidity, higher surface/depth
  ratio, and costs (time and money).</p> <p>This is a Theoretical Challenge that requires
  only a written proposal to be submitted.</p>'
