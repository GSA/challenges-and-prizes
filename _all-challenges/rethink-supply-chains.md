rules: '<h4>1. CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION</h4>  These Official Rules, Terms &amp; Conditions
  (“Official Rules”) apply to the 2015-2016 Partnership for Freedom’s Rethink
  Supply Chains Challenge (the “Challenge”), sponsored by Humanity United (referred
  to herein as “the Partnership” or “HU”) and administered by Luminary Labs, LLC
  (“Luminary Labs”). Please read these Official Rules carefully before entering
  the Challenge, since you must comply with these Official Rules in all regards
  to be eligible to win any prize.    The Challenge calls upon developers, designers,
  advocates, and innovators to submit concepts for technological solutions that
  help businesses, workers, governments, or non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
  identify, prevent, and eradicate labor trafficking and/or forced labor practices
  from the supply chain for goods and services. For the purposes of this challenge,
  labor trafficking and /or forced labor practices include forced labor, slavery,
  the worst forms of child labor, and human trafficking, defined as the recruitment,
  harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or
  services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion, for the purpose of subjection
  to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.    Specific areas
  of focus and potential objectives for submissions to address are included within
  the Challenge Details page of the Website (www.partnershipforfreedom.org/rethinksupplychains).
  Submission(s) may either address one of these Challenge areas or propose an
  alternate objective relating to identifying, preventing, or eradicating labor
  trafficking and/or forced labor practices in supply chains for goods and services.    The
  Challenge will be conducted in four phases:  <ol>   <li>Challenge launch and
  open submission period (“Open Submission Period”);</li>   <li>Judging of submissions
  and selection of finalists;</li>   <li>Finalist Accelerator (inclusive of Finalist
  mentorship and Finalist Boot Camp) (“Finalist Accelerator Phase”); and</li>   <li>Grand
  Prize Application, final judging and selection of Grand Prize winner and Grand
  Prize Runner-Up winner.</li>  </ol>  During the Challenge Open Submission Period,
  any individual, team, or entity (“Entrant” or “Entrants”) that desires to participate
  in the Challenge must make a submission via the Luminary Lightbox<sup>TM</sup>platform,
  accessed through the Partnership for Freedom website. The submission should
  contain a description of the technological solution, the issue the technology
  solution will address, and generally how the solution will address that issue.
  Entrants should complete the submission form, including uploads of required
  documents and completion of the submission checklist.    Following the close
  of the Open Submission Period, up to five eligible submissions will be selected
  by a panel of judges appointed at the sole discretion of the Partnership (“Judges”)
  as finalist submissions (“Finalist”), based on evaluation of the submissions
  under the criteria set forth in these Official Rules. If the Judges determine
  that no submission sufficiently satisfies the criteria for the Challenge, then
  no submission will be chosen. To qualify as a Finalist, the submission must
  be chosen by the Judges, the Finalist must be qualified to enter in compliance
  with these Official Rules, and each Finalist must agree to the terms and conditions
  of the Master Challenge Agreement in all regards.    Qualifying Finalists will
  be awarded a cash prize of $20,000 to further develop their concept in the Finalist
  Accelerator Phase, where there will be the opportunity to receive assistance
  and to participate in an in-person Finalist Boot Camp. Finalists are encouraged
  to use their $20,000 award to improve upon their submission concept during the
  Finalist Accelerator Phase with the goal of submitting an application for the
  Challenge’s Grand Prize or Runner-Up Grand Prize. At the end of the Finalist
  Accelerator Phase, each Finalist will have the opportunity to submit a Grand
  Prize Application consisting of an updated description of the concept, an overview
  of how the concept evolved during the Finalist Accelerator Phase, a demonstration
  of the prototype, an implementation timeline to build out the prototype into
  a deployable solution within 12 months of the Challenge, key learnings during
  the Finalist Accelerator Phase.    From among the Grand Prize Application submissions,
  one (1) Grand Prize winner and one (1) Grand Prize Runner-Up winner will be
  selected. The Grand Prize is an award of $250,000 to further develop the concept
  set forth in the Grand Prize Application, and the Grand Prize Runner-Up award
  is $50,000 to further develop the concept set forth in the Grand Prize Runner-Up
  winner’s Grand Prize Application.  Both a Grand Prize winner and a Grand Prize
  Runner-Up winner will be chosen only if two submissions meet all judging criteria
  and otherwise conform to the Official Rules and the Master Challenge Agreement.  <h4>2.

  CRITERIA</h4>  A panel of between five and seven judges with experience in the
  fields of business, investing, technology, human rights, and/or philanthropy
  chosen by the Partnership (the “Judges”) will select up to five Finalists from
  the pool of eligible submissions, and from the Finalists will choose up to one
  Grand Prize winner and one Grand Prize Runner-Up winner.    The judging will
  be based and scored upon the Judges’ evaluation of each submission received
  during the Open Submission Period according to the following evaluation criteria
  (“Finalist Evaluation Criteria”):    <strong>Finalist Evaluation Criteria:</strong>  <ol>   <li><strong>Feasibility:</strong>
  Likelihood that the proposed solution can be developed into a prototype by the
  end of the Challenge and into a deployable solution within twelve (12) months
  of Challenge completion.</li>   <li><strong>Usability:</strong> Degree to which
  the solution is designed to meet the needs of its target audience and incorporates
  the principles of user-centered design, in which the needs, wants, and limitations
  of end users of the solution are given extensive attention at each stage of
  the design process.</li>   <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Ability of solution
  to be replicated or commercialized within or across industries, geographies,
  and/or audiences.</li>   <li><strong>Commitment:</strong> Demonstrated ability
  of Entrant to develop and implement and commercialize the concept.</li>   <li><strong>Impact:</strong>
  Ability of the solution to make meaningful and measurable progress in identifying,
  preventing, or eradicating labor trafficking and/or forced labor practices in
  supply chains for goods and services.</li>  </ol>  Submissions may be targeted
  towards a specific sector or geographic region, and/or any intervention point
  in a supply chain for goods or services.    While submissions during the Open
  Submission Period may be conceptual, the successful concept will be capable
  of becoming a prototype by the time of the Grand Prize Application, with the
  prototype further evolving into a deployable solution within twelve (12) months
  of the announcement date of the Challenge’s Grand Prize winner and Grand Prize
  Runner-Up winner.    <strong>Grand Prize Evaluation Criteria</strong>    The
  Grand Prize Evaluation Criteria, which the Judges will use to determine the
  Grand Prize winner and Grand Prize Runner-Up winner, include the Finalist Evaluation
  Criteria as well as the following additional criteria:  <ul>   <li>Willingness
  and ability to participate in the Finalist Accelerator.</li>  </ul>  <ul>   <li>Demonstration
  of ability to effectively iterate and improve the concept into a prototype.</li>  </ul>  <ul>   <li>Demonstration
  of ability to create a deployable solution within twelve (12) months.</li>  </ul>  All
  decisions of the Judges, upon approval of the Partnership, are final and binding
  and in their sole discretion.    By participating in the Challenge, each Entrant
  – whether an individual, a team of individuals or entities, or an entity- acknowledges
  and agrees to be bound by and not to challenge the decisions of the Judges.    When
  notification of Finalists and/or Grand Prize winner and Grand Prize Runner-Up
  winner is completed, or as soon as is practical thereafter, abstracts of the
  Finalists submissions and/or Grand Prize winner and Grand Prize Runner-Up winner,
  as applicable, may be posted on the Challenge website.  No public announcement
  of scores or evaluations of any type by Judges will be posted or available. Individual
  feedback on submissions or applications will not be provided other than to Finalists
  eligible to participate in the Finalist Accelerator Phase.  <h4>7. AVAILABLE
  PRIZE AWARDS</h4>  The total available prize pool for the Challenge includes
  $400,000 in prizes and up to $100,000 of anticipated in kind support, the form
  and amount of which is to be determined and provided by the Partnership in its
  sole discretion. From the $400,000 Challenge prize pool, up to five Finalists
  will be awarded $20,000 following the judging of open submissions. Finalists
  will have the opportunity to improve and iterate upon their submissions and
  to develop a prototype during the Finalist Accelerator Phase. After the Finalist
  Accelerator Phase, Grand Prize Applications shall be submitted. The same Judges
  will select one (1) Grand Prize winner to receive a $250,000 grant and one (1)
  Grand Prize Runner-Up winner to receive a $50,000 grant. The Partnership reserves
  the right to disburse the Grand Prize and Grand Prize Runner-Up awards over
  the course of one or more payments, which payments may track milestones and
  achievements in improving and deploying the submission.    The Grand Prize and
  the Grand Prize Runner-Up awards must be used to support the development of
  the technological solution proposed in the submission. This may include covering
  operational or administrative costs of an organization to implement the concept,
  as appropriate.    If selected as a Grand Prize or Grand Prize Runner-Up winner,
  Entrants must enter into HU’s standard form of grant agreement and abide by
  the grant requirements in order to receive any grant funding for development
  of their solutions.  Grand Prize or Grand Prize Runner-Up winners may also be
  required to participate in periodic meetings and conference calls to to share
  knowledge and information from their experiences working on their solutions
  with the Partnership and other key stakeholders.  If after being selected, a
  Grand Prize or Grand Prize Runner-Up winner is unable for any reason to fulfill
  the terms of the Master Challenge Agreement or the HU grant agreement to which
  payments will be subject, the Partnership reserves the rights to select alternate
  winners and to require that any unspent funds be returned.  <h4>8. NOTICE TO
  FINALISTS/WINNER(S)</h4>  Attempts to notify Finalists and winner(s) will be
  made using the email address provided on the Luminary Lightbox™ platform in
  connection with the original submission. The Partnership and Luminary Labs are
  not responsible for e-mail addresses or other communication problems of any
  kind. The Entrant has the sole responsibility to advise the Partnership and

  for contacting the Entrant.    If there is no response within five (5) calendar
  days to any notification, or if the notification is returned as undeliverable
  to the Partnership or Luminary Labs, the Entrant may be disqualified and an
  alternate Finalist or winner may be selected at the Partnership’s sole discretion.    If
  any potential prize winner is found to be ineligible, has not complied with
  these Official Rules, the Master Challenge Agreement, or the grant agreement
  to which Grand Prize and Grand Prize Runner-Up winners will be subject to, or
  declines the applicable prize for any reason, such potential prize winner will
  be disqualified and an alternate winner may be selected, or the prize may not
  be awarded if the mission and objectives of this Challenge and the Partnership
  cannot be met.  <h4>9. ATTENDANCE</h4>  To maintain eligibility, Finalists are
  required to participate in the Finalist Accelerator Phase organized by the Partnership
  and Luminary Labs, including the in-person Finalist Boot Camp. If the Entrant
  is unable to participate in the Finalist Accelerator Phase, Entrant will not

description: <h4>Around the world, tens of millions
  of people are estimated to be in modern slavery, generating global profits estimated
  at $150 billion a year. The ILO estimates that 14.2 million people are victims of
  forced labor in private economic activities.</h4>  We believe that forced labor
  has no place in the goods and services that make up today’s global economy and that
  we need new ideas, tools, and efforts to address this problem. From connecting with
  workers to identifying where forced labor is occurring, technology-informed approaches
  and tools will have a critical role to play. We encourage individuals, organizations,
  and teams to submit their ideas for using technology to address any aspect of forced
  labor in global supply chains. We look forward to supporting the best and most innovative
  ideas to become reality.
