  2.&nbsp;Electronic Synthetic Chemistry Portal&nbsp;for Translational Innovation
  in Pain, Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose</strong>.&nbsp;In order to enable
  further access into the currently unexplored biological space relevant to treatment
  of pain and/or drug addiction and overdose, this second Challenge rewards and
  spurs solutions to the development of next-generation,&nbsp;<strong>open source</strong>&nbsp;electronic
  laboratory notebook (eLN) that would serve as an electronic synthetic chemistry
  knowledge portal (eSCP) and allow for real-time molecular design hypothesis
  generation and unbiased data collection during the synthesis planning, execution
  and analysis while providing a strong and comprehensive contextual analysis
  to biological testing data of experimental targets and currently known pain
  drug comparators. This Challenge requires submission of only a detailed description
  of the design of the eSCP, not the final working portal. The innovators may
  use currently available open source eLNs and modify them to meet the Challenge&rsquo;s
  requirements. The ultimate goal is to effectively utilize data and outcomes
  from both positive and negative synthetic chemistries for future discovery and
  development of novel structures and chemistries of relevance to the treatment
  of pain and opioid use disorder. The eSCP is expected to be modular or flexible
  to accommodate additional features if required and to provide external control
  mechanism (e.g., API or CLI). All data entries, including chemical structures,
  should be in a format that can be easily ported to advanced machine learning
  algorithms and/or downstream analytical applications.</p>\r\n<h4>Judging criteria:</h4>\r\n<h4>Evaluation

description: "<h3><strong>SUMMARY OF NCATS ASPIRE DESIGN CHALLENGE 2</strong></h3>\r\n<h4><strong>Electronic
  Synthetic Chemistry Portal for Translational Innovation in Pain, Opioid Use Disorder
  and Overdose</strong></h4>\r\n<p><strong>Challenge 2</strong> aims to address the
  need for a next-generation open source electronic lab notebook (eLN) that collects,
  organizes and analyzes data relevant to the chemical synthesis and analyses of known
  opioid and non-opioid-based analgesics, drugs of abuse and molecules used to treat
  drug abuse into an electronic laboratory knowledge portal for synthetic chemistry
  (electronic synthetic chemistry portal; eSCP).&nbsp; This challenge requires submission
  of only a detailed description of the design of the eSCP, not the final working
  portal.&nbsp; The innovators may use currently available. While the focus of this
  challenge is on a specific translational problem relevant to pain treatments and
  drug abuse and overdose, the eSCP should be designed to be generally applicable
  to any kind of laboratory chemical and biological data collection, recording and
  analysis of data relevant to any translational challenge, be modular; and well architected
  for advanced machine learning applications.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The design should address
  the following judging criteria and will be evaluated based on the potential to achieve
  these criteria.&nbsp; Winners from this challenge will be strongly encouraged to
  develop their designs to compete in an envisioned follow-up reduction-to-practice
  challenge.</p>\r\n<p>Evaluation criteria that reviewers will be asked to address
  are specified under the \"Judging Criteria\" tab.</p>\r\n<p>For complete details
  on the challenge,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ncats.nih.gov/aspire/challenges/challenge2\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">visit the NCATS ASPIRE Design Challenge 2 details
  page</a>.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>About NCATS ASPIRE Design Challenges</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The
  National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), part of the National
  Institutes of Health (NIH) is inviting novel design solutions for A Specialized
  Platform for Innovative Research Exploration (<strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong>) Challenges
  as part of the <strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong> Program. The goal of the <strong>NCATS
  ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges is to reward and spur innovative and catalytic
  approaches towards solving the opioid crisis through development of: (1) novel chemistries;
  (2) data-mining and analysis tools and technologies; and (3) biological assays that
  will revolutionize discovery, development and pre-clinical testing of next generation,
  safer and non-addictive analgesics to treat pain, as well as new treatments for
  opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose. The first phase of these prize competitions
  is implemented through a suite of concurrent companion design challenges that comprises
  a separate challenge for each of four areas: chemistry database, electronic laboratory
  knowledge portal for synthetic chemistry, algorithms, and biological assays; and
  an additional challenge for a combined solution to at least two Challenge areas.
  At this stage, innovators are expected to submit designs, not final products or
  prototypes.NCATS envisions following these design challenges with a follow-on, but
  distinct, final reduction-to-practice challenge, which will aim to invoke further
  scientific and technological development of the model system. Winners of the design
  challenges will be invited to present their designs so that, in the envisioned follow-up
  Reduction-to-Practice Challenge, an open competition, teams will be able to form
  multi-disciplinary collaborations to advance and integrate the most feasible and
  promising approaches to the multiple challenges into a single integrative platform.
  Innovators will be invited to demonstrate final solutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>NCATS
  ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges are part of the of the NIH&rsquo;s Helping to
  End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national
  opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative will bolster research across
  NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain
  management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at: &nbsp;<a
  href=\"https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative.\">https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative.</a></p>\r\n<p>NCATS
  refers to participants in the <strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges as
  &ldquo;innovators&rdquo; because all solutions will require highly innovative approaches
  to achieve success. &nbsp;Innovators should clearly state how and why the proposed
  solution would provide significant advances over currently available tools. Innovators
  may choose to compete in one or more individual challenges to address a single area
  (Challenges 1-4) or propose a combined solution for at least two Challenge areas
  (Challenge 5).<p>For further information send an
