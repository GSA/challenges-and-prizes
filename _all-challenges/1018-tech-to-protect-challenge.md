  alt="challenge timeline"/></p> <p>The Tech to Protect Challenge is an open
  innovation opportunity led by the National Institute of Standards and
  Technology (NIST), Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division.
  Taking place throughout 2019 in ten different cities across the country, the
  challenge features ten contests which allow for on-line and in-person
  participation. Each contest is designed to develop new, creative technologies
  to address issues faced by fire, law enforcement and EMS emergency
  responders.</p> <p>The Tech to Protect Challenge is designed to engage
  entrepreneurs, technologists, students, programmers, designers and public
  safety experts to create solutions across critical technical areas of public
  safety communications, including secure communications, location-based
  services, public safety data analytics, mission-critical voice and user
  interface/user experience (UI/UX). The participant proposed solutions will
  support emergency responders&rsquo; use of advanced communications
  technologies in accomplishing their day to day activities, critical
  responsibilities in emergencies, and beyond.</p> <p>Over the course of
  2019-2020, the challenge will include ten unique contests, host ten codeathons
  in cities across the United States, and award up to $2.2 million in cash
  prizes to participants. The challenge invites participants of all skill
  levels; provides opportunities to engage with subject matter experts; and
  offers access to resources needed to develop viable technology prototypes and
  solutions. The ten in-person codeathon events will take place in two bursts,
  September 27-29 and November 1-3, 2019, with the Online Contest launching a
  rolling application period between June 1 and November 16, 2019. Ultimately, a
  final national award event will be hosted in April 2020 to showcase and make
  the final cash awards to the top performing participants.</p> <p>Participants
  with diverse skill sets and varying levels of experience are welcome and
  encouraged to participate:</p> <ul> <li>Students, professionals and
  entrepreneurs with technical and non-technical backgrounds including
  engineers, computer scientists, software developers, designers, communications
  experts, illustrators, project managers and others.</li> <li>Emergency
  responders and others with an interest in public safety communications with
  technical and operational experience. This includes individuals with field
  experience, private and public entities that provide communications products
  or services, and individuals with an interest in software and hardware
  elements of communications technologies.</li> </ul> <p>In addition to
  NIST&rsquo;s Public Safety Communications Research Division, several
  co-sponsors and partnering organizations will be involved in the
  implementation of the challenge. The co-sponsors generally include public,
  private, and civic organizations such as technology solution providers, public
  safety-focused technology companies, public safety agencies and associations,
  universities, coding academies, and others &mdash; all in support of the
  participants and the challenge&rsquo;s objectives.</p>

  <div class="judging-criterias"> <div> <h4>Judging Panels </h4> <p>Three
  judging panels will operate in a chronological series. Panels will be composed
  of a diverse group of individuals with specialized skills and experience
  relevant to the evaluation periods&rsquo; objectives. Each individual judge is
  appointed by the NIST Director, and required to sign a non-disclosure
  agreement (NDA) and conflict of interest (COI) disclosure to ensure that all
  participant materials are held in confidence and all judging is fair for
  participants.</p> <p>The Judge panel consists of experts who will evaluate the
  participants&rsquo; submissions according to the criteria defined for each
  contest. The objective of the judging will be to rank and select the top
  submissions in each period of evaluation. The decisions of the judges for the
  contest will be announced in accordance with the dates noted in the "Important
  Dates" section of these rules.</p> <p>In support of the judges and the
  evaluation process, reviewers are subject matter experts covered by NDA and
  COI requirements, who focus on implementing specific elements of the
  evaluation process. Reviewers provide evaluation support by assisting with the
  facilitation of the contests, implementing test and assessment activities, and
  other processes that generate data for the consideration of the judges, who
  are responsible for considering all the information and making the final
  decisions.</p> <p><strong>Panel 1:</strong> Regional Codeathon Judging
  Panel</p> <p>The Regional Codeathon Judging Panel will be established to
  support the evaluation of submissions at each Regional Codeathon event. The
  judges will coordinate between individual codeathon events, in burst 1 and
  burst 2, to ensure consistency and uniform implementation of evaluation
  process.</p> <p><strong>Panel 2:</strong> Online Contest Judging Panel</p>
  <p>The Online Contest Judging Panel will be established to support the
  consolidated evaluation of online submissions and the &ldquo;best and
  final&rdquo; updated versions of Regional Codeathon submissions. The
  consolidated evaluation will be completed between November 16, 2019 and
  January 27, 2020 through an online judging process.</p> <p><strong>Panel
  3:</strong> National Award Event Contest Judging Panel</p> <p>The National
  Judging Panel will be established to select the National Winners of the Tech
  to Protect Challenge. The final evaluation will be completed in-person at the
  National Award Event in April 2020.</p> <p><strong>Panel 4:</strong> National
  Award Event Contest Judging Panel</p> <p>Following the completion of the Seed
  Contest, this Judging Panel will convene to evaluate the final submissions
  from Seed Contest Winners, and determine the Progress Contests Winners.</p>
  </div> <div> <h4>Evaluation Criteria </h4> <p>What determines the winners?
  This challenge includes ten unique contests and the evaluation process is
  designed to be as straightforward and simple as possible for participants to
  navigate. The graphic below represents the evaluation process that will be
  applied universally across all contests.</p> <p>Each contest includes
  evaluation criteria 0-5. Criteria 0 is a basic pass/fail compliance checklist
  of minimum requirements for submissions. Beyond the minimum requirements
  check, contests include up to five technical criteria used to evaluate
  submissions. Each technical criterion is weighted at 10-40 points out of a
  total of 100 points. Criteria items 0 through 3 will be used to evaluate
  Regional Codeathon and Online Contest submissions. Criteria items 4 and 5
  represent the most advanced criteria items and will be used to evaluate the
  top submissions from the Online Contest, prior to selecting the National
  Finalists. Each of these five criteria items represent different features and
  attributes that the participant submissions will need to clearly demonstrate
  to the judges. The same evaluation process will be used throughout the
  challenge, with variation by contest for criteria 4-5. Each contest area has
  unique criteria, but in general examples may include aspects such as the
  application&rsquo;s UI/UX operability, accuracy, effectiveness, relevance to
  the contest&rsquo;s sample use case, and other similar elements.</p> <p><img

  Codeathon Evaluation </h4> <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p> <ul>
  <li>Selection of up to the top 4 submissions per Regional Codeathon
  event.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Selection of one submission per contest (up to ten
  total) to be recognized at each Regional Codeathon event.</li> </ul>
  <p><strong>Process:</strong></p> <p>Regional Codeathon submissions will be
  evaluated by judges and reviewers at the end of each 48-hour codeathon event.
  <strong>Codeathon submissions will be evaluated against criteria items 0
  through 3</strong> for a total of 60 rating points out of 100. A specific
  judging approach will be followed at the codeathon event, as described below.
  Participants will not be provided oral or written feedback based on the
  evaluation of their submissions.</p> <h4>Judging Phases</h4>
  <p><strong><span>Phase 1 - Initial compliance check</span></strong></p>
  <p><span>Criteria \#0</span></p>
  <p><strong><span>Objective:</span></strong><span> Initial assessment on

### Description

<div class="description">
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/image002.png" width="858" height="210" alt="challenge timeline"/></p>
<p>The Tech to Protect Challenge is an open innovation opportunity led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division. Taking place throughout 2019 in ten different cities across the country, the challenge features ten contests which allow for on-line and in-person participation. Each contest is designed to develop new, creative technologies to address issues faced by fire, law enforcement and EMS emergency responders.</p> 
<p>The Tech to Protect Challenge is designed to engage entrepreneurs, technologists, students, programmers, designers and public safety experts to create solutions across critical technical areas of public safety communications, including secure communications, location-based services, public safety data analytics, mission-critical voice and user interface/user experience (UI/UX). The participant proposed solutions will support emergency responders&rsquo; use of advanced communications technologies in accomplishing their day to day activities, critical responsibilities in emergencies, and beyond.</p> 
<p>Over the course of 2019-2020, the challenge will include ten unique contests, host ten codeathons in cities across the United States, and award up to $2.2 million in cash prizes to participants. The challenge invites participants of all skill levels; provides opportunities to engage with subject matter experts; and offers access to resources needed to develop viable technology prototypes and solutions. The ten in-person codeathon events will take place in two bursts, September 27-29 and November 1-3, 2019, with the Online Contest launching a rolling application period between June 1 and November 16, 2019. Ultimately, a final national award event will be hosted in April 2020 to showcase and make the final cash awards to the top performing participants.</p> 
<p>Participants with diverse skill sets and varying levels of experience are welcome and encouraged to participate:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Students, professionals and entrepreneurs with technical and non-technical backgrounds including engineers, computer scientists, software developers, designers, communications experts, illustrators, project managers and others.</li> 
<li>Emergency responders and others with an interest in public safety communications with technical and operational experience. This includes individuals with field experience, private and public entities that provide communications products or services, and individuals with an interest in software and hardware elements of communications technologies.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>In addition to NIST&rsquo;s Public Safety Communications Research Division, several co-sponsors and partnering organizations will be involved in the implementation of the challenge. The co-sponsors generally include public, private, and civic organizations such as technology solution providers, public safety-focused technology companies, public safety agencies and associations, universities, coding academies, and others &mdash; all in support of the participants and the challenge&rsquo;s objectives.</p>

### Judging Criteria

<div class="judging-criterias"> 
        <div class="prize-item">
                                        <h4>Judging Panels
                                </h4>
                                      <p>Three judging panels will operate in a chronological series. Panels will be composed of a diverse group of individuals with specialized skills and experience relevant to the evaluation periods&rsquo; objectives. Each individual judge is appointed by the NIST Director, and required to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and conflict of interest (COI) disclosure to ensure that all participant materials are held in confidence and all judging is fair for participants.</p>
<p>The Judge panel consists of experts who will evaluate the participants&rsquo; submissions according to the criteria defined for each contest. The objective of the judging will be to rank and select the top submissions in each period of evaluation. The decisions of the judges for the contest will be announced in accordance with the dates noted in the "Important Dates" section of these rules.</p>
<p>In support of the judges and the evaluation process, reviewers are subject matter experts covered by NDA and COI requirements, who focus on implementing specific elements of the evaluation process. Reviewers provide evaluation support by assisting with the facilitation of the contests, implementing test and assessment activities, and other processes that generate data for the consideration of the judges, who are responsible for considering all the information and making the final decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Panel 1:</strong> Regional Codeathon Judging Panel</p>
<p>The Regional Codeathon Judging Panel will be established to support the evaluation of submissions at each Regional Codeathon event. The judges will coordinate between individual codeathon events, in burst 1 and burst 2, to ensure consistency and uniform implementation of evaluation process.</p>
<p><strong>Panel 2:</strong> Online Contest Judging Panel</p>
<p>The Online Contest Judging Panel will be established to support the consolidated evaluation of online submissions and the &ldquo;best and final&rdquo; updated versions of Regional Codeathon submissions. The consolidated evaluation will be completed between November 16, 2019 and January 27, 2020 through an online judging process.</p>
<p><strong>Panel 3:</strong> National Award Event Contest Judging Panel</p>
<p>The National Judging Panel will be established to select the National Winners of the Tech to Protect Challenge. The final evaluation will be completed in-person at the National Award Event in April 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Panel 4:</strong> National Award Event Contest Judging Panel</p>
<p>Following the completion of the Seed Contest, this Judging Panel will convene to evaluate the final submissions from Seed Contest Winners, and determine the Progress Contests Winners.</p>

                                        <h4>Evaluation Criteria
                                </h4>
                                      <p>What determines the winners? This challenge includes ten unique contests and the evaluation process is designed to be as straightforward and simple as possible for participants to navigate. The graphic below represents the evaluation process that will be applied universally across all contests.</p>
<p>Each contest includes evaluation criteria 0-5. Criteria 0 is a basic pass/fail compliance checklist of minimum requirements for submissions. Beyond the minimum requirements check, contests include up to five technical criteria used to evaluate submissions. Each technical criterion is weighted at 10-40 points out of a total of 100 points. Criteria items 0 through 3 will be used to evaluate Regional Codeathon and Online Contest submissions. Criteria items 4 and 5 represent the most advanced criteria items and will be used to evaluate the top submissions from the Online Contest, prior to selecting the National Finalists. Each of these five criteria items represent different features and attributes that the participant submissions will need to clearly demonstrate to the judges. The same evaluation process will be used throughout the challenge, with variation by contest for criteria 4-5. Each contest area has unique criteria, but in general examples may include aspects such as the application&rsquo;s UI/UX operability, accuracy, effectiveness, relevance to the contest&rsquo;s sample use case, and other similar elements.</p>
