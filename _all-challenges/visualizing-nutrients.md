description: '<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nutrient Pollution, Algal
  Blooms and Hypoxia</span>    More than 100,000 miles of rivers and streams, close
  to 2.5 million acres of lakes, reservoirs and ponds, and more than 800 square miles
  of bays and estuaries in the U.S. have poor water quality due to nitrogen and phosphorus
  pollution.  Nutrient pollution – excess nitrogen and phosphorus – in U.S. waterways
  is caused by a number of factors including natural or anthropogenic origins, industrial
  and municipal wastewater facilities, diffuse runoff from developed land, and agricultural
  sources.  Further, environmental and geological processes (including precipitation,
  climate change, soil, and hydrology) can increase or decrease the delivery rate
  of nutrients into waterways.    Nutrient pollution endangers not only America’s
  waterways and ecosystems but has significant impact on communities and the individuals
  that comprise them.  Human health, access to clean drinking water, recreation and
  tourism industries, real estate values, and local economies are negatively impacted
  by toxic algal blooms and the low oxygen levels they produce (hypoxia).  While various
  sectors including government, environmental nonprofits, water utilities and the
  agriculture community are researching, innovating and, to varying degrees, implementing
  solutions to reduce excess nutrients in waterways, the voices of citizens and communities,
  those directly affected, have remained largely absent from the stakeholder table
  that drives action at the local watershed level.    This Challenge is in support
  of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/19/fact-sheet-president-s-climate-data-initiative-empowering-america-s-comm">President’s
  Climate Data Initiative</a>.    &nbsp;    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Open
  Data</span>    Large quantities of useful data are being collected and maintained
  in government and non-government open databases in the United States. One of this
  Challenge’s main goals is to engage data innovator and visualization communities
  to leverage these open government data resources to help communities better understand
  the impacts of algal blooms and hypoxia in their waterways and inspire actions to
  reduce nutrient levels at the individual, collective, and/or community level.    &nbsp;    <span
  style="text-decoration: underline;">The Challenge</span>    USGS, US EPA, and Blue
  Legacy International challenge Solvers to design an innovative visualization that
  both a) informs individuals/communities on one or more threats, causes, consequences
  of, facts about, or solutions to nutrient pollution, and b) through compelling visualization,
  drives them to take action.    &nbsp;    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example
  Application of Nutrient Data</span>    As just one of many cases, Solvers may consider
  a recent example of the effect of nutrients on ecosystems and human health: the <a
  href="http://toledo.oh.gov/news/2014/08/urgent-water-notice/">August 2014 harmful
  algal bloom (HAB)</a> that was witnessed in Toledo, Ohio, USA. One possible approach
  for this case would be to develop a data visualization which could serve as a prototype
  ‘situational awareness dashboard’ related to HABs similar to the Center for Disease
  Control <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/outbreaks/investigating-outbreaks/SEDRIC-Fact-Sheet.pdf">food-borne
  illness response system</a>.'
