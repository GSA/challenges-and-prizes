  in a research and design process.</p>    <strong>LOCATION</strong><br>    The competition
  proposals should be based on specific places or areas in Washington D.C. Proposals
  may take a physical form or may be virtual. Preference will be given to teams
  that propose a site or sites <strong>outside of</strong> the National Mall.
  The following locations are suggestions reflecting typical opportunity sites
  for new memorials in Washington:    Near the monumental core: <br><strong>The Belvedere
  </strong>  The Belvedere is located on waterfront parkland within West Potomac
  Park and is bounded by the Potomac River to the west, the Theodore Roosevelt
  Bridge to the north, and the Rock Creek Parkway to the east. The Belvedere is
  also situated between the Kennedy Center to the north and the Lincoln Memorial
  to the south, providing a visual link between the two structures. The Belvedere
  is the historic terminus of the western end of Constitution Avenue and provides
  open vistas across the Potomac River to Virginia, as well as the natural environment
  of Rock Creek and West Potomac Parks.    Within a residential area: <br><strong>Randle
  Circle or Tenley Circle</strong><br>  Memorials must be integrated with community
  uses and goals for public plazas and open space. Implementation of new memorials
  within the city''s residential areas must be closely coordinated with neighborhood
  plans prepared by local residents and elected officials.<br>    <strong>Randle Circle</strong>
  is located in a residential neighborhood in Southeast Washington, D.C. Randle
  Circle comprises two landscaped parcels that are associated with the intersection
  of Massachusetts and Minnesota Avenues, SE. The entrance to Fort Dupont Park,
  part of the National Park System and the Civil War Defenses of Washington, is
  located on Randle Circle. The character of the surrounding neighborhood should
  be considered in any future memorial for the site.    <br><strong>Tenley Circle</strong>
  is located in a vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood setting and is within walking
  distance of the Tenleytown-American University Metro station. Tenley Circle
  comprises several landscaped parcels that are associated with the intersection
  of Wisconsin and Nebraska Avenues, NW. While the total land area associated
  with this site is significant, the central parcels, located on Wisconsin Avenue,
  are small and occupied by existing transit uses (bus stops). In conjunction
  with several out-parcels, Tenley Circle is suitable for commemorative features.
  The character of the surrounding neighborhood should be considered in any future
  memorial for the site.    <br>Around a natural setting: <strong>Hains Point</strong>  Hains
  Point is located at the confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers and is
  part of East Potomac Park. The site is bounded by the Washington Channel and
  the Potomac River shorelines and offers dramatic waterfront vistas within the
  established open space setting of the park. Adjoining park uses include passive
  and active recreation such as golf, swimming, jogging, and biking. Existing
  site conditions are waterfront landscaped parkland with open lawn areas and
  clusters of trees. The site is accessible throughout the year by vehicle from
  Ohio Drive. Although East Potomac Park is envisioned as the location for future
  commemorative works, Hains Point has not been specifically designated as the
  location for a memorial.    &nbsp;'

description: '<p>The National Park Service (NPS), the National Capital Planning Commission
  (NCPC), and Van Alen Institute are collaborating on Memorials for the Future, an
  ideas competition to reimagine how we think about, feel, and experience memorials
  with the <strong>Memorials for the Future</strong> challenge.</p>    <p>Memorials enshrine
  what we as a society want to remember. But the places, people, and stories that
  we memorialize, and the audiences who engage with them are constantly changing.
  A memorial tells its story through subject matter and design. This story is often
  complex and multi-dimensional, as a memorial''s interpretive elements embody ideas
  of identity, culture, and heritage, and each has intensely personal interpretations
  for every individual.</p>    <p>As a national capital, Washington is a place of collective
  memory. The wealth of monuments sited throughout the city take on heightened significance
  as they reflect relationships among nations, of national remembrance, and of many
  important events and figures in our history. Often the traditional and fixed nature
  of memorial design does not allow for adaptation and redefinition over time and
  does not encourage more than one interpretation of a given narrative.</p>    <p>The traditional
  approach to developing memorials in Washington has resulted in a commemorative landscape
  that is thematically similar and increasingly land-intensive, which poses challenges
  for Washington, and has long-term implications for the potential uses of a memorial''s
  surrounding park setting.</p>    <p>The planning and design process is often costly and
  lengthy, which limits opportunities to groups or individuals with significant resources.
  Current trends raise a number of questions about the future of Washington''s memorial
  landscape and the ability to provide space and resources for future commemorative
  works.</p>    <p><strong>Memorials for the Future</strong> calls for designers, artists,
  and social scientists to develop new ways to commemorate people and events that
  are more inclusive and flexible, and that enrich Washington''s landscape while responding
  to the limitations of traditional commemoration. As NPS celebrates its centennial
  in 2016, Memorials for the Future creates new ideas for honoring our diverse histories,
  heritage, and culture.</p>    <p>The entries will be narrowed to three teams to participate
  in a research and design process, working closely with the competition partners
  to develop site-specific designs for memorials in Washington D.C. that are adaptive,
  ephemeral, virtual, event-focused, or interactive. The teams'' proposals will advance
  a framework for the design of 21st-century memorials and provide future memorial
  sponsors with fresh approaches to commemorating their subject matter.</p>    The goals
  of the competition are to create new approaches to and forms of memorializing:  <ul>   <li>That
  advance a framework for the planning and design of commemorative works in the 21st
  century.</li>   <li>That demonstrate
  how temporary, mobile, interactive or adaptive displays can provide powerful and
  memorable experiences that are cost-efficient.</li>   <li>That develop ways to commemorate that are inclusive of multiple
  narratives and have the potential to be flexible as perspectives change.</li>   
  <li>That Honor the scale, context and national
  significance of Washington, DC.</li>  </ul> <p>The competition results will be displayed
  online and at an exhibition in Washington D.C., published in an illustrated report,
  and will inform NPS, NCPC, and their partners on future design and policy opportunities.    The
  deadline for registration and electronic submission of the Request for Concepts
  is <strong>11:59 p.m. EDT on May 4, 2016</strong>.</p>    <strong>PHASES</strong><br>    <p><strong>Phase
  I</strong> – Initial Application  April 11 – May 4, 2016    Applications from multidisciplinary
  teams for this Request for Concepts are due May 4, 2016. (See submission requirements
  below for more information on applying.) Phase I will conclude on May 30, 2016,
  with the notification of the three teams selected to participate in the competition.    Finalist
  teams will attend a launch event in Washington, DC, on June 8, 2016 and June 9,
  2016. Teams will present their initial proposals to the competition partners, advisory
  committee, and any public attendees.</p>    <p><strong>Phase II</strong> – Research and
  Design Concept  June 8 – July 10, 2016    Over the course of the subsequent five
  weeks, teams will continue to conduct research and refine designs. Teams will participate
  in weekly calls with competition partners during which they will show in-progress
  work (via PDF sent beforehand). Teams are expected to incorporate feedback from
  the competition partners throughout the five-week process.    For one to two days
  during the week of July 11, 2016, teams will reconvene for a design framework mid-review
  working session.</p>    <p><strong>Phase III</strong> – Final Designs  July 11 – August
  1, 2016    Teams will have between three and four weeks to develop their final memorial
  proposals. During this period, teams will participate in weekly calls with competition
  partners and show in-progress materials via PDF.    For one to two days during the
  week of August 1, teams will meet again for a final design presentation.</p>   <p><strong>Phase
  IV</strong> – Exhibition Development and Installation  August 1 – September 8, 2016    During
  the time period between the final review and exhibition launch, teams will participate
  in weekly calls with competition partners and show in-progress materials for the
  exhibition via PDF.    <strong>TIMELINE</strong>  <ul>   <li>April 18, 2016 – Pre-registration
