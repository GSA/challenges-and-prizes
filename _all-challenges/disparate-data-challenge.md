  style="text-align: center;">_____________________________________________</p> <p> Just
  like the commercial world, the government is drowning in data, and accessing that
  data to discover the insights hiding within it remains difficult. The National Geospatial-Intelligence
  Agency (NGA) Disparate Data Challenge encourages participants to offer solutions
  that can demonstrate effective capabilities that enable access to data that is wildly
  disparate in its formats, schemas, interfaces and locations, so that it may be available
  for search, business metrics and data and information analytics.</p><p>    This is a multistage
  challenge open to U.S. and foreign citizens, or and U.S. or foreign entities. Please
  be advised that while foreign citizens and foreign entities may participate, they
  are not eligible to receive cash (monetary) prizes (see full eligibility requirements
  below.)   </p><p> <strong>STAGE 1:</strong>  Stage 1 requires solvers to implement functioning
  capabilities that can demonstrate access and retrieval to analyze either part or
  all of the provided representative datasets that approximate the difficulties associated
  with accessing and using NGA’s disparate restricted-access holdings. You may access
  the data through the following link: <a href="http://disparatedata.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/"
  target="_blank">http://disparatedata.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/</a>.    Stage
  1 solution submissions must be actual working capabilities (not just white papers,
  but working code) that can perform their functions against the representative datasets
  specified above.    As part of Stage 1, NGA reserves the right to make up to twenty
  awards, or no award at all. Award decisions will be based on the solutions’ potential
  to work well when applied to the restricted-access data holdings. NGA will award
  up to 15 cash prizes in the amount of $10,000 each to the top 15 eligible awardees.
  The total amount available for cash prizes is $150,000. All Stage 1 awardees  will
  also receive invitations to participate in Stage 2 of the challenge.  Stage 1 awardees
  will be announced on September 30, 2016.  </p><p>  <strong>STAGE 2: </strong> Stage 2 of
  the challenge is restricted to Stage 1 awardees.  Stage 2 of the challenge is a
  demonstration (Demo-thon) of the Stage 1 awardees solutions in the Washington, D.C.
  area.  Execution of Stage 2 is dependent on extension of NGA’s challenge authority
  into fiscal year 2017 (FY17 starts OCT 1, 2016). The Stage 1 awardees will be notified
  via email if and when the Government receives authority to proceed with Stage 2.    At
  the Demo-thon another panel of judges will use participants’ solutions to access,
  retrieve, and examine the representative datasets used during Stage 1. Participants
  will have an opportunity to demonstrate other special features that they believe
  address the challenge.  Participants will be asked to connect to additional datasets
  in preparation for the demo.  Stage 2 participants will have a chance to improve
  their solution during Demo-thon and will have the opportunity to re-demonstrate
  before the judges make a final decision. Additional NIST data sets will be added
  during the second stage and used to test technical effectiveness.  To get a feel
  of the type of NIST data that will be added at Stage 2, a sample collection of data
  can be obtained <a href="http://trec.nist.gov/data/reuters/reuters.html" target="_blank">http://trec.nist.gov/data/reuters/reuters.html</a>
  by signing up for access at the site. </p><p>   As part of Stage 2, NGA reserves the right
  to make multiple awards, or no reward at all. Award decisions will be based upon
  the solutions the judges determine to be most responsive to the challenge and most
  likely to be effective when applied to part or all of NGA’s restricted-access data.
  Although there is no limit to the number of Stage 2 participants that may be declared
  winners (i.e., have meaningfully met and addressed the challenge), NGA reserves
  the right to award up to three additional cash awards to the three highest rated
  eligible awardees (highest rated ($25,000), second highest rated ($15,000) or third highest
  rated ($10,000)).    The challenge concludes upon announcement of the Stage 2 winners. </p><p>   <strong>IMPORTANT
  DATES:</strong>    August 19 – Challenge published on challenge.gov    September
