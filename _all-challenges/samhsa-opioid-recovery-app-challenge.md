  Sponsor or Administrator reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify
  any Submission that is a duplicate or substantially similar to another Submission.    (iii)

  the Administrator may conduct testing on the Application to determine whether
  malware or other security threats may be present. Submission not complying with
  these requirements may be disqualified.    (iv) Each Application will be tested

  Prizewinners may be required to submit the source code and any relevant data
  of their Application to the Administrator and/or Sponsor upon request at any

  other person or entity having any right or interest in it; and (c) not violate
  the Intellectual Property rights or other rights including but not limited to
  copyright, trademark, patent, contract, and/or privacy rights, of any other
  person or entity. A Contestant may contract with a third party for technical
  assistance to create the Submission provided the Submission components are solely
  the Contestant’s work product and the result of the Contestant’s ideas and creativity,
  and the Contestant owns all rights to them.    (x) By entering a Submission,
  Contestant represents, warrants and agrees that the Submission (including, without
  limitation, the Application) is the original work of the Contestant and complies
  with the Official Rules.    Contestant further represents, warrants and agrees
  that any use of the Submission by the Sponsor, Administrator and/or Judges (or
  any of their respective partners, subsidiaries and affiliates) as authorized
  by these Official Rules, shall not:    a. infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise

  to a Submission will remain with the Contestant.    B. As part of its submission,
  the Applicant must provide written consent granting the Sponsor and Administrator,
  and any third parties acting on the Sponsor’s behalf, a royalty-free, non-exclusive,
  worldwide license to display publicly and use for promotional purposes the Prize
  Winning Submission (also referred to as the “Public Submission”), in perpetuity.
  This license includes posting or linking to the Public Submission on Sponsor
  and Administrator’s websites, including the Competition Website, and partner
  websites, and inclusion of the Submission in any other media, worldwide. The
  Non-Public Submission may be viewed by the Sponsor, Administrator, and Judges
  for screening and evaluation purposes. Sponsor and the Administrator, and any
  third parties acting on their behalf will also have the right to publicize Contestant’s
  name and, as applicable, the names of Contestant’s team members or Organization
  which participated in the Submission on the Competition Website for a period
  of two years following the conclusion of the Competition.
  <h5><strong>7. DISPLAY OF SUBMISSIONS</strong></h5>  A. Eligible Submissions will be posted
  on the Competition Website on a rolling basis after being screened and/or tested
  by the Administrator for basic functionality, accuracy of messaging, integrity
  (i.e., security) and appropriateness of content. The Administrator has the right
  to request additional information and be provided access to the Application
  in person or via any reasonable manner to verify the Application functions and
  operates as stated in the Submission. Failure by a Contestant to respond or
  honor such a request may result in disqualification of the Submission.    B.
  Posting of a Submission to the Competition Website does not constitute a final
  determination by the Sponsor and/or Administrator that the Submission met requirements.
  Accordingly, a Submission may still be disqualified even after it has been publically
  displayed.  <h5 id="8-winner-selection-and-judging-criteria"><strong>8. WINNER
  SELECTION AND JUDGING CRITERIA</strong></h5>  A. All eligible Submissions will
  be judged by an expert panel of impartial judges (the “Judges”) selected by
  the Sponsor. The internal panel will judge these Submissions on the criteria
  identified in these Official Rules to select finalist Submissions. Finalist
  Submissions will then be judged by the expert judging panel determined by the
  Sponsor. The judging panel is not required to test the Application and may choose
  to judge based solely on the text description and video provided in the Submission. 
  The Sponsor and the Administrator reserve the right to divide and assign the
  criteria identified below in these Official Rules among different members of
  the internal and expert judging panels. The Sponsor and the Administrator reserve
  the right to substitute or modify the judging panel at any time for any reason.    B.
  All Judges shall be and remain fair and impartial. Any Judge may recuse him
  or herself from judging a Submission if the Judge, the Sponsor or the Administrator
  considers that it is inappropriate, for any reason, for the Judge to evaluate
  a specific Submission or group of Submissions.    C. A Contestant’s likelihood
  of winning will depend primarily on the number and quality of all of the Submissions,
  as determined by the Judges using the criteria in these Official Rules. The
  judging period is May 30, 2016 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time through July 1, 2016
  at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time (the “Judging Period”).    D. Criteria:    <strong>Judging
  Criteria:</strong>    a. Quality of Idea (Includes the degree to which the proposed
  app can support patient recovery by addressing the required and optional insights,
  the creativity of the idea and the innovation of the proposed app to support
  recovery).    b. Implementation of Idea (Includes how well the idea was implemented
  including the user experience, design and technical functionality).    c. Potential
  Impact (includes the patient value and potential impact the application can
  have for individuals in recovery).    E. If deemed necessary by the judging
  panel, each of the top five finalists may be asked to participate in a virtual
  or in-person meeting with federal staff to discuss their Application and demonstrate
  its operation. The purpose of these meetings will be to further evaluate the
  Contestant''s product, provide any additional information to SAMHSA, and clarify
  any concerns or questions raised by the review panel.    F. Tie Breakers. In
  the event of a tie between two or more Submissions, the panel of Judges will
  vote on the tied submissions.    G. The Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole
  discretion, to    a. cancel, suspend, or modify the Challenge, and/or    b.
  not award any prizes if no submissions are deemed worthy.    H. All decisions
  made by the Sponsor regarding adherence to contest rules are final.    I. All
  selection of contest winners is final.    <h5><strong>9. VERIFICATION OF POTENTIAL
  WINNERS</strong></h5>    A. ALL POTENTIAL COMPETITION WINNERS ARE SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION

  Period and Judging Period. Potential winners will be notified using the email

  ten (10) business days).    B. At the sole discretion of the Sponsor and Administrator,
  a potential winner will be deemed ineligible to win if:    (i) the potential
  winner (or in the case of a team or Organization, their Representative) cannot
  be contacted within seven (7) business days, or is contacted and refuses the
  Prize;    (ii) the potential winner (or in the case of a team or Organization,
  their Representative or any participating member) fail(s) to sign and return
  the affidavit(s) of eligibility or a similar verification document and liability/publicity
  release(s) within seven (7) business days from receipt of such documents;    (iii)
  the Prize or Prize notification is returned as undeliverable; or    (iv) the
  Submission or the potential winner, or any member of a potential winner’s team
  or organization, is disqualified for any other reason.  In the event of such
  disqualification, Sponsor and Administrator at their sole discretion may award
  the applicable Prize to an alternate potential winner. The disqualification
  of one (or more) team members (or, in the case of Organizations, any participating

description: '<p>Are
  you good at creating user-friendly mobile apps for smartphones? Do you like to make
  a positive difference in the lives of others and in our nation’s communities? Then
  we’re looking for you to work on this challenge! Just as there are apps to help
  people with diabetes manage their disease, people in recovery from opioid use disorder
  could benefit from an app that provides features and information that support their
  recovery.</p><p>Addiction is a chronic brain disease. Those who suffer from a substance
  use disorder need help to change their behavior and learn new strategies to maintain
  health. They can get this help with treatment—with the care of doctors and substance
  use disorders treatment providers. Treatment can help people stop using substances.
  It helps them get through withdrawal and cope with cravings. Treatment also helps
  address other harmful behaviors that are not conducive to recovery.</p><p>Just as important,
  treatment helps people address life issues they might have that can trigger relapse,
  such as feelings of low self-worth, a bad situation at work or home, a co-occurring
  mental disorder, or spending time with people who use drugs. In short, treatment
  helps people move into healthy lifestyles—into a new way of living which is referred
  to as recovery.</p><p>Treatment may include medication. Medication-assisted treatment
  (MAT) is treatment that includes the use of medication along with counseling and
  other types of support. Treatment that includes medication-assisted treatment is
  an important option for opioid use disorder. Medication-assisted treatment can reduce
  problems of withdrawal and craving. Research also shows maintenance treatment typically
  leads to reduction or cessation of illicit opioid use and its adverse consequences,
  including cellulitis, hepatitis, and HIV infection from use of nonsterile injection
  equipment, as well as criminal behavior associated with obtaining drugs. These changes
  can give the person the chance to focus on the lifestyle changes that lead back
  to healthy living.  People in outpatient MAT could benefit from a mobile app for
  smartphones that provides features and information that supports their maintenance
  in recovery.</p><p>Below are some ideas and information on the insights regarding what
  patients receiving MAT might need, and what an app like this might do to respond
  to those insights. There are some required features and resources that must be included
  in the final product we’ve provided them in the <a href="https://challenges.s3.amazonaws.com/ABT/Challenge%20Assets%20_FINAL%20APPROVED.xlsx"
  target="_blank">assets</a> file. <em>The rest is up to you.</em> We ask you to be
  creative and innovative, and to develop a good user experience. You might want to
  collaborate with an existing recovery tool already on the market, or think of a
  recovery-related use to an existing tool.</p><p>What does someone in recovery from
  opioid use disorder need and what type of mobile app could you create?</p> <br><strong>Here’s
  insight one:</strong> Since medication-assisted treatment is likely an important
  part of an individual’s recovery, patients may need drug interaction and side effect
  information for methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone that they can access on
  their own, 24/7. For instance, an individual may have started methadone treatment
  a couple of days ago but is suddenly feeling some side effects and can’t reach a
  doctor to ask them about these side effects. With the app, they can look up side
  effects, how long they might last, and what else they can anticipate – all via the
  privacy of their smartphone.    <br><strong>Insight two</strong>: Patients receiving
  MAT need education and psychoeducational materials for opioid recovery support,
  such as how to manage their time; information on parenting skills; and the effects
  of drug use on their family. Perhaps they haven’t told their friends yet that they’re
  receiving MAT, and aren’t sure how to go about it. Access to information that explains
  to friends and family what MAT is and how it helps with recovery could be made available,
  or shared with a friend, via their smartphone.    While a person receiving MAT has
  a doctor, case manager, and addiction counselor, the provider may not have enough
  time in an appointment to provide all of the resources that a patient may need.
  A patient could use a one-stop shop for psycho-educational resources that provide
  tips, facts, and worksheets on how to deal with common issues and concerns that
  occur in opioid recovery, such as problems sleeping; dealing with drug triggers;
  avoiding relapse; dealing with guilt; managing time, life, money, and emotions;
  repairing relationships; and dealing with other health issues. Having these resources
  on a smartphone – a tool many people carry with them everywhere – means that they
  are available for use and referral in down time, waiting time, or crisis time.   <br> <strong>Insight
  three</strong> is related to relapse prevention – an important component of recovery.
  One of the main ways to prevent relapse is getting involved in healthy activities
  - replacing unhealthy habits with new habits that have emotional, physical, and/or
  social wellness benefits, such as participating in peer support groups, and exercise.
  An app feature that helps patients find local recovery support meetings easily and
  anonymously, or online peer support groups they could access via their phone – would
  put recovery support at their fingertips. The second important component of relapse
  prevention is being aware and avoiding triggers for drug use. Triggers could be
  certain people, places, or situations. Perhaps a feature that reminds patients,
  via a call or text when a trigger is present would be useful – to help keep their
  recovery at the forefront of their awareness.    <br><strong>Insight four</strong> describes
  how individuals in MAT need support in relapse prevention such as warning signs,
  trigger alerts, and motivations for recovery. Could recovery motivation reminders
  in a calendar tool, with links to personal motivations – such as photos of family,
  friends, pets, or goals – help patients stay focused on their reasons for recovery?
  Could a trigger response feature be created with contacts when a person needs support?
  Perhaps they could link other motivational materials to reminders – like links to
  inspiring YouTube videos, songs, talks/podcasts, fitness links, memes, or photos
  from their photo gallery. Another important component of relapse prevention is being
  aware and avoiding triggers for drug use. Triggers could be certain people, places,
  or situations. Perhaps a feature that reminds patients, via a call or text when
  a trigger is present would be useful – to help keep their recovery at the forefront
  of their awareness.    <br><strong>Insight five</strong> shows that Individuals in MAT
  maintenance are often juggling their work, personal, and treatment schedules. Maintaining
  recovery means finding new ways to live a healthy lifestyle just as other individuals
  with chronic health conditions must do.  How could an app help with this? Could
  a time management tool, with daily reminders for doctor, counselor, and treatment
  appointments help?    <p>So here is the Challenge…SAMHSA would like the development
  of a free, opioid recovery focused and user friendly <em>Opioid Recovery Support
  app</em> available to patients in recovery who are receiving outpatient medication-assisted
  treatment. Any features, tools, or <a href="https://challenges.s3.amazonaws.com/ABT/Challenge%20Assets%20_FINAL%20APPROVED.xlsx"
  target="_blank">assets</a> in the app need to be tied to the insights provided,
  because the insights came from evidence-based practices, which means that they’ve
  been proven effective through practice and research.    Interested in making a difference?
  There are already several recovery support, time management, and sobriety helper
  apps on the market that do some of the things we’ve mentioned above but may not
  be specific to opioid recovery or address the insights of this challenge. You may
  want you partner with them to develop a version that meets the requirements of this
  challenge. Or you can develop a brand new app that responds to the insights and
  delivers the required features and resources in a robust and user-focused format?
  Don’t forget to read the <a href="https://challenges.s3.amazonaws.com/ABT/Challenge%20Assets%20_FINAL%20APPROVED.xlsx"
  target="_blank">Rules and Requirements</a>, because they have important additional
  information you need in order to participate. Whether you update an existing recovery
  support app or develop an entirely new one, SAMHSA wants you to submit your solutions!    See
  the App information (see “REQUIREMENTS” below and the <a href="https://challenges.s3.amazonaws.com/ABT/Challenge%20Assets%20_FINAL%20APPROVED.xlsx"
