description: "<p><strong>BOLDLINE: THE P3 ACCELERATOR</strong></p>\r\n<p>The U.S.
  Department of State is proud to launch Boldline, an accelerator for public-private
  partnerships (P3s). One of the first programs of its kind, Boldline supports partnerships
  that address pressing global challenges and focuses on giving them tools to scale
  their missions. The main goal of Boldline is to build and deploy strategic connections
  and collaborations aimed at: a) strengthening the global partnership building ecosystem;
  b) promoting and facilitating connectivity between the private sector and governments;
  and c) fostering innovative partnership business models. Boldline seeks to take
  the often dotted lines (or gaps) between sectors and, by cultivating public-private
  partnerships, create a bold line between them.</p>\r\n<p><strong>P3S + 1 WEEK</strong></p>\r\n<p>New
  public-private partnership ideas and partnerships ready to scale their operations
  and activities take part in a one-week program. Boldline provides participants with
  access to resources, mentorship, and a global network. The first iteration of the
  accelerator took place in February 2018 in Washington, DC. The participating P3s
  were presented at the 2018 Global Partnerships Week forum on March 5th at the U.S.
  Institute of Peace.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TO APPLY</strong></p>\r\n<p>Log in to Challenge.gov
  and click the red Submit button on the top right of the page. Applications for the
  Boldline/GEC Cohort 3 will be accepted through email at: <a href=\"mailto:%20partnerships@state.gov\">partnerships@state.gov</a></p>"
