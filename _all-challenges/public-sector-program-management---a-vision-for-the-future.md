  style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>APPENDIX - Profiles of Public Sector Program
  Managers – ca.</strong><strong style=\"font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;\">
  2014</strong></span></h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\r\n<span
  style=\"color: #000000;\">Program managers in the public sector are a diverse
  group.  They confront an extraordinary range of challenges in mission areas
  as diverse as regulatory compliance, basic research, service delivery, law enforcement,
  and military preparedness, to name just a few.  While many are unique to a particular
  program mission, some challenges tend to be shared by all program managers.</span></p><p><span
  style=\"color: #000000;\">The following profiles offer a snapshot of the immediate
  challenges faced by four government program managers.  These challenges are
  defined in part by the tools and resources available to address them.  They
  are defined, as well, by current expectations of what government can and should
  do.  As expectations change, and as technology and workplace skills evolve,
  the nature of these challenges will change as well.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:
  #000000;\"><strong>Profile 1 - regulatory compliance</strong></span></p><p><span
  style=\"color: #000000;\">Trina is a program manager with a Federal Government
  regulatory agency.  She leads an office that writes policy, processes industry
  applications for licenses, and tracks routine industry reporting in support
  of the agency’s industry compliance efforts.  The office also conducts inspections
  to ensure industry compliance with laws and policy.  In the 20 years that Trina
  has spent with the Government, the work of her office has been transformed by
  historic advances in online and data processing technologies.  Although the
  agency’s compliance efforts are more effective than at any point in the past,
  Trina recognizes the need to develop more sophisticated approaches to keep up
  with a rapidly evolving industry and an increasingly complicated regulatory
  environment.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Profile 2
  - service delivery</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Henry
  manages a program that benefits low income households.  Removing barriers to
  participation by eligible households is central to the program’s purpose.  At
  the same time the program is committed to eliminating payments to ineligible
  recipients. Henry believes that facilitating access to benefits and strengthening
  program integrity need not compete against each other; greater understanding
  of the factors that lead to improper certification for program benefits might
  be useful in developing strategies to reach the unserved eligible population. 
  Henry has challenged his staff and program partners to draw on their diversity
  of skills and perspectives to come up with ideas that advance both goals simultaneously
  so that 25 years from now the present tension between the two is replaced with
  a relationship of positive and mutual reinforcement.  Welcome to the team!</span></p><p><span
  style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Profile 3 - grants management</strong></span></p><p><span
  style=\"color: #000000;\">Ty oversees an office that awards and administers
  grants to community-based social service organizations.  As part of an ongoing
  effort to maximize the agency’s return on investment, Ty’s office is awarding
  more grants to organizations that promise innovative approaches to service delivery. 
  Many of those organizations are first-time recipients of government grants. 
  Although Ty and his staff are encouraged by early signs of success, they recognize
  the need for careful oversight and evaluation.  They also recognize that new
  models of service delivery may call for changes in the way that the office collects
  and analyzes program data.  Responding to these challenges is critical to ensuring
  that management of the grant-making process does not stand in the way of grantee-led
  program innovation.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Profile
  4 - law enforcement</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Sami
  was recently hired by her city’s chief of police to review the organization’s
  case prioritization approach.  She is faced with the dilemma of meeting higher
  expectations for successful criminal prosecution/crime reduction/agility in
  response to emerging threats without any increase in enforcement and civilian
  staff.  She is expected to do so in a more transparent manner and to further
  complicate things, the budget is shrinking.  Sami is reaching out to other law
  enforcement agencies to learn what they are doing that she may be able to replicate
  but she also believes that new, innovative approaches are necessary to meet
  expectations in the long run.  She is actually more concerned about internal
  resistance to trying new approaches than she is about anything else.</span></p>"

  original vision will see beyond or around the path defined by a linear extension

  original vision will identify new or emerging trends that have the potential

description: '<p>Planning,
  project management, financial management, employee engagement, and reporting are
  among the key responsibilities of today’s public sector program managers. The approach

  work of public sector program managers change over the next 25 years?  How <em>should</em> it
  change?  How <em>can</em> it change with thoughtful steering?</p><p>The Performance Improvement Council wants
  to hear from you.  Look ahead 25 years and let us know what you see.</strong></em></p>    
  <h4>GUIDELINES</h4><p>Your entry should describe where you think the field of public sector program
  management will be in 25 years.  You may choose to illustrate your vision with a
  scenario that reaches ahead to the year 2039.  Or you may describe your vision in
  more general terms.  Either way, use your foresight and be creative.</p><p>Note that
  today’s kindergartners will be well on their way to established careers in business
  and government in 25 years.  And today’s teenagers will be moving into positions
  of senior leadership, reshaping the way the world does business.  Although
  you should consider how advances in technology and the skill set of a new generation
  will drive the development of public sector program management, your entry need
  not address any particular issue or question.  Imagine how the work of government
  program managers will evolve, and describe what you see.  We’re interested in <i>your</i>
  vision.</p><p>The appendix at the bottom of this page contains brief profiles of four
  government program managers and some of the challenges they faced in 2014.  These
  profiles are an entirely optional resource for your benefit.  Use them if you find
  them helpful in focusing your thoughts, but do not let them limit your creativity.</p><p>
   <em>Your entry need not refer to any of the themes discussed in these profiles</em>.    <a

  </h4><p>The General Services Administration
  (GSA) and the Performance Improvement Council expect this challenge to kick off
  an ongoing dialog about current trends and challenges in public sector program management,
  what tomorrow promises, and how today’s managers can position themselves and their
  organizations for future success.  GSA will feature winning entries on both the
  challenge homepage and on the GSA website.  GSA will also invite contest winners
  to participate in a moderated and recorded Google Hangout conversation, and may
  highlight ideas from one or more winning entries in a follow-up contest.</p>'
