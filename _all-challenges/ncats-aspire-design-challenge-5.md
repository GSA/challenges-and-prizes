  5.&nbsp;Integrated Solution for Translational Innovation in Pain, Opioid Use
  Disorder and Overdose.</strong>&nbsp;The goal of this Challenge is to converge
  component areas 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Integrated Database, Electronic Synthetic Chemistry
  Portal, Predictive Algorithms and Biological Assays, respectively) from the
  very beginning into an Integrated Solution. As with the individual&nbsp;<strong>NCATS
  ASPIRE</strong>&nbsp;Design Challenges, an Integrated Solution is expected to
  incorporate each of the requirements and desired features as detailed in the
  individual Challenge areas. In addition, while individual components may be
  operating from different locations, the functionality and degree of integration
  of the components in the design of the Integrated Solution will be evaluated.

description: "<h3><strong>SUMMARY OF NCATS ASPIRE DESIGN CHALLENGE 5</strong></h3>\r\n<h4><strong>Integrated
  Solution for Translational Innovation in Pain, Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose</strong></h4>\r\n<p>NCATS
  is seeking designs for a comprehensive solution to the opioid crisis through innovative
  approaches that integrate solutions to at least two Challenge areas (Challenges
  1-4: Integrated Database, Electronic Synthetic Chemistry Portal, Predictive Algorithms,
  and Biological Assays, respectively) into a single platform.</p>\r\n<p>The goal
  of <strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenge 5 is to converge solutions to
  at least two Challenge areas (Challenges 1-4: Integrated Chemistry Database, Electronic
  Synthetic Chemistry Portal, Predictive Algorithms and Biological Assays, respectively)
  from the very beginning into an Integrated Solution. As with the individual <strong>NCATS
  ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges (see [link]), an Integrated Solution is expected
  to incorporate each of the requirements and desired features as detailed in the
  individual challenge areas. This challenge requires submission of only a detailed
  description of the design of the integrated solution, not the final working integrated
  solution. In addition, while individual components may be operating from different
  locations, the functionality and degree of integration of the components in the
  Integrated Solution will be evaluated. It is anticipated that this challenge would
  require a large, multi-expert team that is likely to be in multiple locations. Hence,
  a plan should be included that describes how the team will be structured and how
  the exchange of knowledge, ideas and implementation of solutions will be facilitated
  among the participating sites.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Evaluation criteria that reviewers
  will be asked to address are specified under the \"Judging Criteria\" tab.</p>\r\n<p>For
  complete details on the challenge, <a href=\"https://ncats.nih.gov/aspire/challenges/challenge5\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">visit the NCATS ASPIRE Design Challenge 5 details
  page</a>.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>About NCATS ASPIRE Design Challenges</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The
  National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), part of the National
  Institutes of Health (NIH) is inviting novel design solutions for A Specialized
  Platform for Innovative Research Exploration (<strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong>) Challenges
  as part of the <strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong> Program. The goal of the <strong>NCATS
  ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges is to reward and spur innovative and catalytic
  approaches towards solving the opioid crisis through development of: (1) novel chemistries;
  (2) data-mining and analysis tools and technologies; and (3) biological assays that
  will revolutionize discovery, development and pre-clinical testing of next generation,
  safer and non-addictive analgesics to treat pain, as well as new treatments for
  opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose. The first phase of these prize competitions
  is implemented through a suite of concurrent companion design challenges that comprises
  a separate challenge for each of four areas: chemistry database, electronic laboratory
  knowledge portal for synthetic chemistry, algorithms, and biological assays; and
  an additional challenge for a combined solution to at least two Challenge areas.
  At this stage, innovators are expected to submit designs, not final products or
  prototypes. NCATS envisions following these design challenges with a follow-on,
  but distinct, final reduction-to-practice challenge, which will aim to invoke further
  scientific and technological development of the model system. Winners of the design
  challenges will be invited to present their designs so that, in the envisioned follow-up
  Reduction-to-Practice Challenge, an open competition, teams will be able to form
  multi-disciplinary collaborations to advance and integrate the most feasible and
  promising approaches to the multiple challenges into a single integrative platform.
  Innovators will be invited to demonstrate final solutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>NCATS
  ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges are part of the of the NIH&rsquo;s Helping to
  End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national
  opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative will bolster research across
  NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain
  management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at: &nbsp;<a
  href=\"https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative.\">https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative.</a></p>\r\n<p>NCATS
  refers to participants in the <strong>NCATS ASPIRE</strong> Design Challenges as
  &ldquo;innovators&rdquo; because all solutions will require highly innovative approaches
  to achieve success. &nbsp;Innovators should clearly state how and why the proposed
  solution would provide significant advances over currently available tools. Innovators
  may choose to compete in one or more individual challenges to address a single area
  (Challenges 1-4) or propose a combined solution for at least two Challenge areas
  (Challenge 5).<p>For further information send an email
