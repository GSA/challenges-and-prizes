judging-criteria-0: 'Criterion 1: DATA-DRIVEN'
judging-criteria-description-1: The applicant should demonstrate a real understanding
  of the situation that their solution is helping to address. Impact will be measured
  according to the degree to which the solutions can provide actionable insights
  for on the ground farming decisions to be made in Nepal.    In particular,        Clear
  articulation and understanding of the specific need at farm level (e.g., area
  of productivity)  that is being addressed.        Whether there is a good understanding
  of the likely impact that the solution will have on smallholder farmers, including
  gender and cultural dynamics. For instance, by providing a logical reason, or
  set of reasons, for why it is likely to have impact, and why that would be an
  improvement on the current situation.        The extent to which applicants
  have developed a working prototype of the solution by May 2017 to gather feedback
  from smallholder farmers and extension services on its utility and perceived
  impact for representative categories of intended adopters/users.        The
  extent to which a diverse range of smallholder farmers (men, women, ethnic minorities
  etc) and extension or advisory services perceive the applicant’s solution (by
  experiencing a prototype) likely to have a positive impact on on the ground
  farming decisions which support improved agricultural productivity.

description: "<strong>The Problem</strong>  There is a growing global concern about
  the challenges agricultural and food production need to overcome in the next few
  decades. By 2050, the world’s population is expected to reach 9 billion–with over
  a billion at risk of hunger–and arable land is becoming increasingly scarce.  Additionally,
  developing countries suffer the most from a lack of food security and low household
  incomes.    For these reasons, one of the priorities sainder the Sustainable Development
  Goals is to achieve food security and improve livelihoods by raising smallholder
  farmers’ productivity.    Digital technologies have upended business models and
  expanded the frontiers of information access in the developing world. Increasingly
  available digital technologies including sensors, geospatial imagery, mobile financial
  services, and data analytics can be leveraged to make agriculture more precise,
  productive, resilient, and profitable. However, too often that data and analysis
  remains in research intuitions and on computer servers rather than reaching farmers
  or those who work with them.    <strong>Prize Statement</strong>  The prize is seeking
  tools and approaches that source, analyze and translate data into actionable, timely
  and context-specific information for smallholder farmers to improve value from agricultural
  productivity.    In particular the data driven solutions will be tested in Nepal,
  and should be able to meet one or more of the following outcomes:  <ul>    <li>Produce
  timely and context specific insight for improving the production of rice, other
  cereals and vegetables in Nepal.</li>    <li>Support a more sustainable use of Nepal’s
  natural resources (i.e. increase biodiversity, use water more sustainably, improve
  use of land).</li>    <li>Enable the market by providing inputs, extension services,
  and connections which support farmers in a sustainable way in Nepal.</li>    <li>Improve
  influence and application of agricultural products in Nepal (i.e. better use of
  fertilizer, generation of quality seeds).</li>    <li>Generate timely and actionable
  information to manage Nepal’s agricultural productivity risks due to  weather emergency.</li>
