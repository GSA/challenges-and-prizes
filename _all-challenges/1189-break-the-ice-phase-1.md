  In situ resource utilization (ISRU)—the development of lunar materials for life support, fuel, energy, manufacturing, and construction—is necessary to limit the delivery of supplies from Earth. 


  One of the most important of these resources is water. Water supports all life on Earth, and will be critical to supporting human exploration beyond Earth. On the Moon, water is trapped in icy regolith at the lunar poles, including inside permanently shadowed regions (PSRs). 


  Phase 1 of the Break the Ice Lunar Challenge is focused on incentivizing new ideas and approaches to a system architecture for excavation and movement of icy regolith and water on the lunar surface.

  **Prize Breakdown**


  Prize purses for Phase 1 will total up to $500,000. 1st Prize - $125,000, 2nd Prize - $75,000, 3rd Prize - $50,000, and up to ten (10) runner-up Teams will receive up to $25,000 each.

  The Challenge describes a hypothetical Mission Scenario and asks Teams to
  design a system architecture addressing necessary hardware, concept of

  as well as supporting materials that address credibility and feasibility of
  the system architecture.


  In Phase 1, Teams will submit System Architecture, Excavation Plan, and a Mission Animation.  Following the submission deadline, the Judging Panel will review the Phase 1 Submissions and meet (in-person or on video conference) to discuss, evaluate, and rank the Teams. The Judging Panel will evaluate Phase 1 Submissions on the following factors. 


  * Scientific/Technical Merit

  * Completeness

  * Addresses the Mission Scenario

  * Feasibility and Design of Proposed Architecture

  * Key Performance Goals


  Teams must score at least 100 points in order to be eligible for a prize purse.
