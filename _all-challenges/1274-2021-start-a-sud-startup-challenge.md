  The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), one of the components of the
  National Institutes of Health (NIH), announces the annual “$100,000 for Start
  a SUD Startup” Challenge. The Challenge goal is to support research ideas in
  the area of Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) that are intended to be the
  foundation for the development of successful new startups. NIDA expects that
  the Challenge will enable the winners to test the premise that their research
  idea can be fostered into a biotech startup, and that eventually the newly
  created startups will contribute to the pool of innovative small business
  companies that can successfully compete for NIDA’s Small Business Innovation
  Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding. 


  The Challenge will offer up to ten awards of $10,000 each and technical expertise and mentoring from NIDA biomedical entrepreneurship experts. The Challenge total purse is up to $100,000. 


  ***Subject of the Challenge***


  NIDA is reissuing this Challenge after confirming its success and popularity within the community. The Challenge is a competition for participants with research ideas in the Substance Use Disorder (SUD) research area that are purposefully intended to be the foundation for the development of new successful biomedical startups. NIDA offers $100,000 conjointly with technical mentoring from NIDA biomedical entrepreneurship experts. NIDA expects that the prize competition will inspire and enable the winners to test the premise that their SUD research idea can be fostered into a biotech startup. This Challenge is unique because NIDA intends to provide prize money and dedicated biomedical entrepreneurial assistance to the “would be” startup founders much earlier than most investors, incubators, or traditional models of research funding (e.g., small business grants). However, NIDA anticipates that the newly created startups will eventually contribute to the pool of innovative small business companies that can successfully compete for NIDA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding.


  What does it take to participate in the Challenge? The participants must have a research idea directly related to SUD or that could be extended or adopted to be useful for SUD. For a platform technology, the research idea must be broad enough to address multiple conditions, diseases, or indications, including SUD. For example, if the idea would only work for cancer or diabetes, entering this Challenge is not appropriate. However, if the plan is to test an idea for a research tool that would further an understanding of neurobiology or epigenetics relevant to SUD to advance the field faster and with greater fidelity, entering this Challenge is appropriate. The participants must also be interested in creating a startup around their research idea with the goal of creating the startup product for the target customers. Here, the term “product” is used in its broadest definition. Product is any source of value for the people who become customers. Services, subscriptions, software as a service (SaaS), physical/tangible products (biomedical devices, drugs, etc.), aggregations, etc. could all provide value and thus be considered startup products. The startup product could be the result of novel scientific discoveries, repurposing an existing technology for a new use, extending a research observation or discovery made in a different scientific field into the SUD area, devising a new business model or distribution/delivery channel that unlocks new value, or simply bringing a product or service to a previously underserved customer. 


  The potential startup founder must also have the passion, drive, discipline, ability to work collaboratively, and willingness to be coached to push forward under conditions of business uncertainty. 


  The winners of this Challenge are encouraged and offered training to use the prize money to develop a minimum viable product (MVP), to obtain customer feedback to discover if the MVP meets the customer needs, and to assess the feasibility of science-based small business creation within 6 months post-award. Post Challenge, as with all other NIH grant applicants, NIDA staff will provide technical assistance and guidance about the grant submission process, including how to submit an SBIR/STTR application to NIDA’s small business programs.

judging: >-
  **Basis Upon Which a Winner Will be Selected.** The judging panel, comprised
  of federal employee scientists, will consider the following 5 criteria and
  make recommendations to the award approving official based upon their
  assessments of the criteria. Each criterion will be scored with a maximum of
  10 points.


  1. **Team/Founders Aptitudes (0-10 points).** Does the team demonstrate a high level of ability and dedication? Is the passion, drive, discipline, ability to work collaboratively, and willingness to push forward under conditions of extreme business uncertainty successfully demonstrated?

  2. **Validation of Unmet Needs (0-10 points).** Are there significant needs for the proposed product or service? How do you know? Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field of SUD/drug abuse research? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, service, or clinical practice be improved? How will those improvements be measured or established? Is there evidence of market research?

  3. **Idea Novelty (0-10 points).** Does the proposed idea utilize novel theoretical concepts, approaches, methodologies, instrumentation, service, or interventions for SUD/drug addiction research? Is the proposed product novel in a broad sense? Are refinements, improvements, or new applications of theoretical concepts, approaches, methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?

  4. **Approach (0-10 points).** Are the overall research strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to test the proposed idea? Does the approach take the feedback from the end-users or end-user need assessment into account?

  5. **Commercialization (0-10 points).** Is there a clear path for the product/service to reach the market? Are the product users and purchasers clearly identified? Is there evidence of market research or analysis of competitors?


  Submissions that are responsive and comply with the entry requirements will be reviewed by a panel of judges consisting of federal employees. The responsive and compliant submission entries will be scored in accordance with the judging criteria outlined above. Scores from each criterion will be weighted equally, but failure to meet a minimum standard for any one criterion might disqualify a submission. The score for each submission will be the sum of the scores from each of the voting judges. The scores will be listed in order, from highest to lowest. Challenge contenders with sufficiently high scores will then be contacted via tele- or videoconference. Those meetings will be used to gather more details about the information provided in the Submission Package and to determine the up-to-date level of participants’ availability, interest, and commitment. Final prize recommendations will be determined based on the judges’ scoring and tele- or videoconference meetings.
how-to-enter: >-
  Participants must be a group of individuals (i.e., a team assembled with the
  purpose of participating in this Challenge). Each team is required to identify
  a team leader who registers and submits a required Submission Package on
  behalf of the team. The team leader must send the completed registration form
  and all submission materials to
  [NIDAChallenge@nih.gov](mailto:NIDAChallenge@nih.gov) with the subject line
  “**Start a SUD Startup Submission Package**” by the specified submission
  deadline date and time. You can [download the registration form
  here](https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/2021_Start_SUD_Startup_Registration_Form.docx).


  ***Submission Requirements***


  Each submission for this Challenge requires a complete Submission Package. The Submission Package includes the registration form, a 4-page written proposal describing the idea, and a 5-minute video introducing the team (see requirements below for the proposal and video). Both the idea and the 5-minute video will be evaluated. Submissions that do not follow the format described below will be disqualified and removed from the prize considerations.


  * **Proposal.** The proposal must consist of a PDF file with at least 1-inch margins and be no more than four (4) pages long. Font size must be no smaller than 11-point Arial. All submissions must be in English. The participants must not use the HHS logo or official seal or the logo of NIH or NIDA in the submissions and must not claim federal government endorsement.

    ***In the proposal:***

    * **Idea Description.** Describe how your research idea would further an understanding of SUD and be the foundation for a successful startup. The research idea must be defensible and evidence based. (1 page)  
    * **Team Technical Competence and Research Experience.** Convince the Challenge judges of your technical competence. Be brief, persuasive, and only present the relevant information. Do not use the NIH Bibliographic Sketch format. (0.5 page)
    * **Prototype Description and Step-by-Step Use of Final Product, as Envisioned.** Describe, in as many details as possible, what the prototype of your envisioned product would look like. Then, walk the Challenge judges through the typical use of the product, using simple terms and instructions. (1.5 pages)
    * **Need Validation.** Explain the methods you will use (how, when, where, whom) to determine whether the product is needed by the target customer and whether that end user/customer would be willing to pay for the product. (1 page)

  * **Video.** A brief 5-minute video must be posted to YouTube and the link to the video provided. In contrast to the proposal, the video is intended to introduce the team, not the research idea. The team and its people are the most important evaluation criteria for entrepreneurial success. 

    ***In the YouTube video:*** 

    * In one minute or less, tell NIDA who on your team is the lead “hacker,” also known as technical lead, with the skills to develop your product and to focus on the available technology options and requirements.
    * In one minute or less, tell NIDA who on your team is the lead “hipster,” also known as the end user/customer need lead, the person concerned with the customer experience and design. This team member understands the end-user of your product and focuses on the medical and healthcare delivery issues (most often, a practicing SUD physician, clinical department manager, etc.).
    * In one minute or less, tell NIDA who on your team is the lead “hustler,” also known as the business or entrepreneurial lead, with the skills or aspirations to focus on the overall business objectives, customer definition, business plan, etc.
    * Tell NIDA how long you have known each other and relay something that can illustrate the drive or the desire of each team member to become a startup founder.
    * What unique skill set, background, or experience does this team have that has led them to pursue this idea?
    * Tell NIDA something about each team member that demonstrates a high level of perseverance and grit.
    * Tell NIDA about a time when your great idea was rejected. What was your response?

***Submission Requirements***

Each submission for this Challenge requires a complete Submission Package. The Submission Package includes the registration form, a 4-page written proposal describing the idea, and a 5-minute video introducing the team (see requirements below for the proposal and video). Both the idea and the 5-minute video will be evaluated. Submissions that do not follow the format described below will be disqualified and removed from the prize considerations.

* **Proposal.** The proposal must consist of a PDF file with at least 1-inch margins and be no more than four (4) pages long. Font size must be no smaller than 11-point Arial. All submissions must be in English. The participants must not use the HHS logo or official seal or the logo of NIH or NIDA in the submissions and must not claim federal government endorsement.

  ***In the proposal:***
  * **Idea Description.** Describe how your research idea would further an understanding of SUD and be the foundation for a successful startup. The research idea must be defensible and evidence based. (1 page)  
  * **Team Technical Competence and Research Experience.** Convince the Challenge judges of your technical competence. Be brief, persuasive, and only present the relevant information. Do not use the NIH Bibliographic Sketch format. (0.5 page)
  * **Prototype Description and Step-by-Step Use of Final Product, as Envisioned.** Describe, in as many details as possible, what the prototype of your envisioned product would look like. Then, walk the Challenge judges through the typical use of the product, using simple terms and instructions. (1.5 pages)
  * **Need Validation.** Explain the methods you will use (how, when, where, whom) to determine whether the product is needed by the target customer and whether that end user/customer would be willing to pay for the product. (1 page)

* **Video.** A brief 5-minute video must be posted to YouTube and the link to the video provided. In contrast to the proposal, the video is intended to introduce the team, not the research idea. The team and its people are the most important evaluation criteria for entrepreneurial success. 

  ***In the YouTube video:*** 
  * In one minute or less, tell NIDA who on your team is the lead “hacker,” also known as technical lead, with the skills to develop your product and to focus on the available technology options and requirements.
  * In one minute or less, tell NIDA who on your team is the lead “hipster,” also known as the end user/customer need lead, the person concerned with the customer experience and design. This team member understands the end-user of your product and focuses on the medical and healthcare delivery issues (most often, a practicing SUD physician, clinical department manager, etc.).
  * In one minute or less, tell NIDA who on your team is the lead “hustler,” also known as the business or entrepreneurial lead, with the skills or aspirations to focus on the overall business objectives, customer definition, business plan, etc.
  * Tell NIDA how long you have known each other and relay something that can illustrate the drive or the desire of each team member to become a startup founder.
  * What unique skill set, background, or experience does this team have that has led them to pursue this idea?
  * Tell NIDA something about each team member that demonstrates a high level of perseverance and grit.
  * Tell NIDA about a time when your great idea was rejected. What was your response?
