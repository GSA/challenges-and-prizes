  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), Office on Women’s Health (OWH) is seeking innovative ways to ensure women with hypertension during pregnancy and/or postpartum receive appropriate monitoring and follow-up through the HHS Hypertension Innovator Award Competition:  Innovative Methods of Blood Pressure Monitoring and Follow-up in Women during Pregnancy and/or Postpartum.


  #### Background/Issue


  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the [leading cause of death for women](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr60/nvsr60_03.pdf) in the United States. Hypertension [affects one in every twelve to seventeen pregnancies](https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/pregnancy.htm) in the United States. Women with hypertension are at risk for developing preeclampsia, stroke, and other serious complications in pregnancy and/or postpartum. Factors which increase the risk of hypertension during pregnancy include obesity and maternal age. Factors which limit women’s ability to manage their blood pressure include cost, transportation, schedules, locality (living in rural or underserved areas), and lack of education about the importance of good blood pressure control. 


  Innovative programs can overcome these challenges to increase the number of Americans with good blood pressure control and improve the nation’s health. Some progress has been made with home blood pressure monitoring, text-based communications with health care teams, revised prenatal and postpartum visit schedules, new models of patient education and empowerment, and partnerships with different members of the health care team and community.


  #### Purpose


  OWH is creating a national competition to identify effective, pre-existing programs that care for women with hypertension who are pregnant and/or postpartum. The goal of this innovative competition is to demonstrate sustainability and the ability to replicate and/or expand a program that provides effective monitoring and follow-up of hypertension for women who are pregnant and/or postpartum.


  #### Subject and Scope of Prize Competition


  This program will include attention to disparities, including racial/ethnic and/or urban/rural. The program must demonstrate evidence-based approaches to screening and treating hypertensive disorders and will be shared with the general public.


  The competition has three phases. All eligible submissions will be evaluated, and separate prizes may be awarded for each of the three phases.


  #### Key Dates


  **Phase 1:** Identification of successful programs


  * Open September 29, 2020 through October 30, 2020.
