  Vaccinations and well-child visits help prevent outbreaks of childhood
  diseases. Recent [CDC
  data](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e2.htm) show that fewer
  children got vaccines on time this year compared to last year because of the
  COVID-19 pandemic. The P4 Challenge invites applicants to propose and
  implement **innovative approaches to increase access to and utilization of
  well-child visits and/or immunizations services within primary care
  settings.**


  Innovative approaches in Phase 1 should aim to increase a key pediatric health performance measure such as:


  * Number of well-child visits (number of visits/number of children in the target population)

  * Well-child visit disparities (comparing measures across two or more subpopulations)

  * Doses administered of specific vaccines; coverage of the primary pediatric vaccination series (for example, number of MMR vaccines given/number of children 12-18 months in the target population)

  * Disparities within the community on a specific immunization metric (comparing measure across two or more subpopulations)


  In Phase 1 of the P4 Challenge, up to 50 applicants will receive $10,000 to deploy the proposed approach in Phase 2.


  **Goal of the P4 Challenge:**


  The CDC reports that [declines in vaccination coverage](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6920e1.htm?s_cid=mm6920e1_x) might leave young children and communities vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles. Well-child visits also [declined](https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/clinical-guidance/guidance-on-providing-pediatric-well-care-during-covid-19/) since the COVID-19 pandemic. These visits are an important venue for counseling, as well as vaccine administration and documentation.


  At well-child visits, providers can also screen for developmental delays and parents can raise concerns about a child’s physical problems, behavior and mental health and receive personalized guidance on healthy nutrition, exercise and safety.


  It’s important to get the message out to parents and caregivers that children should maintain well-child visits and get timely vaccinations in their medical home. Children who are not up-to-date with vaccinations recommended by the CDC’s [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recommendations.html) should be seen in primary care as soon as possible for catch-up vaccination.


  **Who is encouraged to apply?**


  The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) envisions partnerships from various individuals, companies and organizations to meet all of the needs of the challenge. **Please note that submissions must include a primary care provider who delivers health services to children as a key submitter or partner.** MCHB is seeking concept papers from a wide array of contestants and encourages anyone with a good idea and a collaborative team to apply.
