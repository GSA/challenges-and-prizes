  Recent [CDC data](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e2.htm) show that fewer vaccines have been given during the pandemic, and that to avoid outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases and keep children protected, vaccinations and well-child visits are essential. As noted by CDC, observed [declines in vaccination coverage](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6920e1.htm?s_cid=mm6920e1_x) might leave young children and communities vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles. Additionally, well-child visits are also noted to [have declined](https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/clinical-guidance/guidance-on-providing-pediatric-well-care-during-covid-19/) since the COVID-19 emergency pandemic. These visits are an important venue for counseling as well as administration of vaccines. At these visits, parents can raise concerns about physical problems, as well as about a child’s behavior and mental health. Providers can screen for developmental delays and offer personalized guidance on healthy nutrition, exercise and safety.


  It’s important to get the message out to parents and caregivers that children should maintain well-child visits, as well as continue to get timely vaccinations in their medical home, and ensure that children who may not be up-to-date with vaccines quickly catch up with ACIP-recommended vaccinations.


  Applicants will propose and implement innovative approaches to increase well-child visits and immunizations within primary care settings.
