description: <p><strong><u>The Challenge:&nbsp; An Inclusive Talent Pipeline for American Businesses</u></strong></p>
    <p>The Administration for Community Living (ACL), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is announcing a competition for American businesses to expand human capital pipelines by drawing upon highly talented and diverse workforces, inclusive of people with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To achieve this, the Inclusive Talent Pipeline for American Businesses challenge will support rapid innovation and adoption of models that help businesses improve performance by recruiting and retaining workers with disabilities, including people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>People with disabilities use creativity to navigate the world, and in turn they develop unique strengths, such as problem-solving skills, persistence, forethought and an eagerness to innovate &mdash; all of which are essential to today&rsquo;s market. American businesses that employ and support workers with disabilities see improved performance over their industry peers. On average these firms have:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>28% higher revenue, double the net income, and</li>
    <li>30% higher economic profit margins compared to businesses that did not engage in disability employment and inclusion efforts.<sup>1</sup></li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, companies that employ and support workers with disabilities were twice as likely as companies that do not to have higher total shareholder returns than their peers.&nbsp; Further:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Innovation leads to the development of products and programs that are accessible for all.</li>
    <li>Investors increasingly scrutinize company culture and diversity, including disability inclusion, in investment decisions.</li>
    <li>Inclusive business environments often see improved productivity levels with the addition of employees with disabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>People with disabilities also are an important population for businesses that are working to achieve greater diversity and inclusion of their workforce. With this challenge, ACL is seeking commitments from businesses to include employees with disabilities, particularly with intellectual and developmental disabilities, in their inclusion and diversity efforts and their talent pipeline programs.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, the workforce pipelines proposed here will enable businesses to benefit from the talents of a wider, more diverse workforce and ensure more Americans with disabilities are able to advance and compete in the future economy.&nbsp; ACL recognizes that businesses &ndash; from Wall Street to Main Street &ndash; are critical partners for identifying and testing solutions to this challenge.</p>
    <p>The challenge will take part in phases, with cash prizes awarded in each phase:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Phase 1, beginning in Fall of 2019, seeks proposals from competitors who aim to innovate and tailor the pipeline models to include individuals with IDD.</li>
    <li>Phase 2, beginning in Spring of 2020, participants will be asked to conduct small scale feasibility testing on the selected workforce pipeline models.&nbsp; Teams will convene in Washington, D.C. to propose their ideas to a panel of judges who will help select winners.&nbsp; Judges will have expertise in increasing access into the labor force for people with disabilities.</li>
    <li>Phase 3, beginning in Summer 2020, will examine the replicability, scalability, and long-term sustainability. Teams will again convene in Washington, DC, and the Grand Prize winner will be announced in October of 2020..&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ACL is looking for innovative workforce pipelines that:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Serve people with a wide range of disabilities, including individuals with IDD;</li>
    <li>Redefine career development requirements and pathways using non-traditional methods;</li>
    <li>Innovate and incorporate pipeline components that specifically address the employment barriers for the IDD community;</li>
    <li>Include individuals from the IDD community throughout the development and testing of models;</li>
    <li>Include a business commitment to implement the model for Phase 2 (small scale testing) of the challenge; and</li>
    <li>Lead to competitive, integrated employment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><u>What is a Challenge?</u></strong></p>
    <p>A challenge (also referred to as "prize challenge,&rdquo; "competition," "prize competition," "incentive prize" or any combination thereof) allows the public to solve problems presented by federal agencies and receive awards for the best solutions. This boils down to three steps:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Agency announces a problem to the public.</li>
    <li>Participants create and submit solutions to the problem.</li>
    <li>Agency evaluates solutions and awards prizes to the best ones.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This process may sound similar to grants or contracts, but challenges differ in small and significant ways. In grants and contracts an agency receives proposals to do work, chooses one and then pays the monetary award incrementally as the work is done. In challenges, an agency generally selects winner(s) after assessing work that has been completed. In more complex, multi-phase challenges, phase winners may be selected progressively as development stages are completed.</p>
    <p>Unlike contracts in particular, which provide detailed and comprehensive specifications of the work that needs to be done, challenges define a smaller set of requirements, which allows participants to bring more of their own creativity to solutions.&nbsp; This can be advantageous when a problem can be solved many different ways, including ways that the agency is not even aware of.&nbsp; The open-ended approach can entice participation from those who may not have direct expertise in the problem subject matter area but can lend expertise from their diverse backgrounds.</p>
    <p>Challenges can serve multiple goals beyond sourcing solutions to problems, including:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Signal interest in an area that you think markets should be doing more to serve</li>
    <li>Reach wide communities of experts</li>
    <li>Deliver messages to the public in a fun, interactive way</li>
    <li>Generate interest in new services, data or technologies your agency provides</li>
    <li>Develop public buy-in for agency initiatives</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong><u>Today&rsquo;s Workforce for Americans with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities</u></strong></p>
    <p>With the nation&rsquo;s strong economic growth and historically low unemployment rates, America&rsquo;s business leaders are actively searching for diverse and talented workers to build an inclusive and dynamic national workforce.&nbsp; Despite the more than seven million unfilled jobs, unemployment among Americans with disabilities remains above 70%.&nbsp; For Americans with intellectual and developmental disabilities, the number is even greater with 82% remaining out of the workforce.&nbsp; For individuals with IDD who are employed, data consistently show that the majority work part-time in entry-level positions, have low income, and have limited access to employee benefits.&nbsp; In addition to these gaps, many career tracks are often not accessible to the IDD community because of requirements such as completion of higher education or having a driver&rsquo;s license; many of these requirements are not necessary to succeed.</p>
    <p>In today&rsquo;s thriving and competitive market, businesses across the United States are providing innovative and competitive opportunities to workers to develop new skills and enter into career-tracked jobs.&nbsp; From apprenticeships and training programs, to leadership rotational programs, and integrative internships, employers are developing pipelines for recruiting and retaining talent.&nbsp; Paired against the deep bench of talent from the population of Americans with disabilities, there is current opportunity to develop and expand employment recruitment and workforce pipeline programs to target, train, and retain the talents of workers with disabilities, including those with IDD.</p>
    <p><strong><u>The Opportunity to Modernize Employment Recruitment, Training, and Retention for Americans with Disabilities</u></strong></p>
    <p>How does a company pave the way in the area of disability employment and inclusion?&nbsp; Most success stories showcase companies who bring creativity and innovation to the process of recruitment and training for hiring and retaining people with disabilities.<sup>1</sup> One example includes how technology firms have examined the initial barrier to why people with autism were not getting placed in jobs, and at least one is now partnering with a local company to bring in qualified candidates for a week-long academy of training and technical exercises.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While there are effective ways of building the pipeline to employment for people with disabilities, current best practices in workforce recruitment and training for individuals with IDD require some innovative components such as spending time with individuals in community settings, working with families, and negotiating job responsibilities with an employer.</p>

### Description


<p><strong><u>The Challenge: An Inclusive Talent Pipeline for American Businesses</u></strong></p>
<p>The Administration for Community Living (ACL), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is announcing a competition for American businesses to expand human capital pipelines by drawing upon highly talented and diverse workforces, inclusive of people with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To achieve this, the Inclusive Talent Pipeline for American Businesses challenge will support rapid innovation and adoption of models that help businesses improve performance by recruiting and retaining workers with disabilities, including people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).&nbsp;</p>
<p>People with disabilities use creativity to navigate the world, and in turn they develop unique strengths, such as problem-solving skills, persistence, forethought and an eagerness to innovate &mdash; all of which are essential to today&rsquo;s market. American businesses that employ and support workers with disabilities see improved performance over their industry peers. On average these firms have:</p>
<ul>
<li>28% higher revenue, double the net income, and</li>
<li>30% higher economic profit margins compared to businesses that did not engage in disability employment and inclusion efforts.<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, companies that employ and support workers with disabilities were twice as likely as companies that do not to have higher total shareholder returns than their peers.&nbsp; Further:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innovation leads to the development of products and programs that are accessible for all.</li>
<li>Investors increasingly scrutinize company culture and diversity, including disability inclusion, in investment decisions.</li>
<li>Inclusive business environments often see improved productivity levels with the addition of employees with disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>People with disabilities also are an important population for businesses that are working to achieve greater diversity and inclusion of their workforce. With this challenge, ACL is seeking commitments from businesses to include employees with disabilities, particularly with intellectual and developmental disabilities, in their inclusion and diversity efforts and their talent pipeline programs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the workforce pipelines proposed here will enable businesses to benefit from the talents of a wider, more diverse workforce and ensure more Americans with disabilities are able to advance and compete in the future economy.&nbsp; ACL recognizes that businesses &ndash; from Wall Street to Main Street &ndash; are critical partners for identifying and testing solutions to this challenge.</p>
<p>The challenge will take part in phases, with cash prizes awarded in each phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1, beginning in Fall of 2019, seeks proposals from competitors who aim to innovate and tailor the pipeline models to include individuals with IDD.</li>
<li>Phase 2, beginning in Spring of 2020, participants will be asked to conduct small scale feasibility testing on the selected workforce pipeline models.&nbsp; Teams will convene in Washington, D.C. to propose their ideas to a panel of judges who will help select winners.&nbsp; Judges will have expertise in increasing access into the labor force for people with disabilities.</li>
<li>Phase 3, beginning in Summer 2020, will examine the replicability, scalability, and long-term sustainability. Teams will again convene in Washington, DC, and the Grand Prize winner will be announced in October of 2020..&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>ACL is looking for innovative workforce pipelines that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serve people with a wide range of disabilities, including individuals with IDD;</li>
<li>Redefine career development requirements and pathways using non-traditional methods;</li>
<li>Innovate and incorporate pipeline components that specifically address the employment barriers for the IDD community;</li>
<li>Include individuals from the IDD community throughout the development and testing of models;</li>
<li>Include a business commitment to implement the model for Phase 2 (small scale testing) of the challenge; and</li>
<li>Lead to competitive, integrated employment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>What is a Challenge?</u></strong></p>
<p>A challenge (also referred to as "prize challenge,&rdquo; "competition," "prize competition," "incentive prize" or any combination thereof) allows the public to solve problems presented by federal agencies and receive awards for the best solutions. This boils down to three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Agency announces a problem to the public.</li>
<li>Participants create and submit solutions to the problem.</li>
<li>Agency evaluates solutions and awards prizes to the best ones.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process may sound similar to grants or contracts, but challenges differ in small and significant ways. In grants and contracts an agency receives proposals to do work, chooses one and then pays the monetary award incrementally as the work is done. In challenges, an agency generally selects winner(s) after assessing work that has been completed. In more complex, multi-phase challenges, phase winners may be selected progressively as development stages are completed.</p>
<p>Unlike contracts in particular, which provide detailed and comprehensive specifications of the work that needs to be done, challenges define a smaller set of requirements, which allows participants to bring more of their own creativity to solutions.&nbsp; This can be advantageous when a problem can be solved many different ways, including ways that the agency is not even aware of.&nbsp; The open-ended approach can entice participation from those who may not have direct expertise in the problem subject matter area but can lend expertise from their diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>Challenges can serve multiple goals beyond sourcing solutions to problems, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signal interest in an area that you think markets should be doing more to serve</li>
<li>Reach wide communities of experts</li>
<li>Deliver messages to the public in a fun, interactive way</li>
<li>Generate interest in new services, data or technologies your agency provides</li>
<li>Develop public buy-in for agency initiatives</li>
