  Your Water</strong></span></p>  <p>Visualize Your Water
  is an exciting challenge that will equip high school students with new technology
  skills and help to broaden their understanding of nutrient pollution issues. Students
  will submit their best, most innovative visualization that tells a story about nutrient
  pollution in a local waterway.</p>  <img class="wp-image-112291 size-medium alignleft"

  alt="Credit: Patricia M." width="300" height="300" />    &nbsp;  <p style="text-align:
  left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Background</strong></span></p>  <p
  style="text-align: left;">Nutrient pollution is one of America’s most widespread
  and costly environmental problems. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S.
  Geological Survey, Great Lakes Observing System, Esri (contributor of geographic
  information system (GIS) mapping software to the White House ConnectED Initiative),
  with assistance from the U.S. Department of Education, have come together to initiate
  the Visualize Your Water challenge. This Challenge seeks to engage the innovative
  spirit of high school students in the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay watershed states
  to create compelling visualizations about nutrient pollution using GIS software
  and water quality data collected by federal, state and local efforts. The Visualize
  Your Water Challenge will help students cultivate career-oriented skills and learn
  about local nutrient pollution issues while encouraging environmental stewardship.
  This Challenge continues the work of the Challenging Nutrients Coalition, a coalition
  of federal agencies and non-governmental organizations, to improve our ability to
  measure, understand and reduce nutrient pollution.</p>  <strong>How do teachers
  get involved?</strong> This challenge is an opportunity to bring GIS and water quality
  education into the classroom! Teachers can use this challenge in or out of the class
  room, and provide students the opportunity to engage (singly or in teams) with an
  important environmental issue (water quality) and a robust technology for visualization
  and analysis (GIS).    &nbsp;    <strong>Where to begin? </strong>The <a href="https://esri.app.box.com/vywgettingstartedguide"
