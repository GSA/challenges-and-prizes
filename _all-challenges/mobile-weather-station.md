rules: 'This is a theoretical challenge that requires only a written proposal
  to be submitted. This challenge has two parts:  <ol>    <li>Design a man-portable

  that system from ground level to 10,000 ft. above ground level (AGL) without
  an external gas source.</li>  </ol>  Since there are 2 parts to the problem,
  the Seeker wants to encourage those with only 1 part solved, to still submit
  so there will be an extra award available if someone solves only 1 or 2 above

  objectives as <em>desired,</em> but not required:  <ul>    <li>A system that
  could be scaled up to reach altitudes of 40,000 ft AGL. (Time response/intervals
  would increase to less than or equal to every 1,000 ft. This system must provide
  atmospheric data within 30 minutes of the system being deployed)</li>    <li>A
  system that could autonomously collect the sample and download the data without
  operator input<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[x]</a>.</li>  </ul>  References:    <a
  href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1">[i]</a> More information on radiosonde observations
  can be found at: <a href="http://www.ua.nws.noaa.gov/factsheet.htm">http://www.ua.nws.noaa.gov/factsheet.htm</a>    To
  ensure accuracy, the current system records data every 15ft and smooths that
  data to report atmospheric conditions at intervals of every 100ft. While averaging
  between multiple points to report data at 100ft intervals is not required, care
  should be taken to ensure all measurements at 100ft intervals are accurate.
  Explanation of how the system ensures this accuracy is encouraged.    <a href="#_ednref2"
  name="_edn2">[ii]</a> If the system is free-floating during the ascent, wind
  speed and direction can be calculated from the GPS positions    <a href="#_ednref3"
  name="_edn3">[iii]</a> If the system is free-floating during the ascent, wind
  speed and direction can be calculated from the GPS velocity. If wind speed and
  direction is acquired in a different way, GPS velocity is not required.    <a
  href="#_ednref4" name="_edn4">[iv]</a> If the wind speed is calculated from
  the GPS velocity, separate wind speed data is not required.    <a href="#_ednref5"
  name="_edn5">[v]</a> Time response is also the frequency of measurement, i.e.
  a time response of â‰¤1 sec means that measurement must be take less than or
  equal to every second.    <a href="#_ednref6" name="_edn6">[vi]</a> Line of
  sight is the atmospheric sensor to ground receiver in Nautical Miles (NM)    <a

  href="http://raob.com/">http://raob.com/</a>    <a href="#_ednref8" name="_edn8">[viii]</a>
  The system can be disposable or reusable. If the system is reusable, the cost
  per use is calculated by the total cost of the system divided by the number
  of times that it can be deployed.    <a href="#_ednref9" name="_edn9">[ix]</a>
  An example of a gas "in-situ" would be the ambient atmospheric air    <a href="#_ednref10"
  name="_edn10">[x]</a> One example of an autonomous process: Operator sets up
  the system, turns it on, and inputs the collection parameters (i.e. go to 9K
  ft and come back down). System launches on demand, collects data, and returns
  to launch site autonomously. Data is downloaded to a device. The operator than
  runs the data into RAOB and defines characteristics of the atmosphere.'

description: 'Weather data is vital to the U.S. military, impacting missions worldwide.
  The need to collect atmospheric data in numerous remote areas around the world is
  never going away. This challenge is to design a man-portable system that is capable
  of collecting atmospheric data from ground level to 10,000 ft. above ground level
  (AGL). This data needs to be downloaded to a portable computer that that operator
  will be carrying with them. This system cannot use an external gas source (gas not
  present in situ and/or naturally present in operating environment that needs to
  be carried in such as Helium tanks) to lift the sensor to altitude since these gases
  are not readily available and expensive.    Technical merit: Proposals will be evaluated
  based on the system’s ability to meet the most or all of the threshold requirements
  listed in the Rules section of this challenge.'
