  class="news-subheadline"><i>Thousands of submissions received from more than 140
  teams</i></div>  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary
  field-label-hidden">  <div class="field-items">  <div class="field-item even">  <div
  class="syndicate">    The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of
  the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) today announced
  the winners of the <a id="anch_29" href="https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/interoperability/demystifying-patient-matching-algorithms/"
  data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/interoperability/demystifying-patient-matching-algorithms/">Patient
  Matching Algorithm Challenge</a>.    ONC selected the winning submissions from over
  140 competing teams and almost 7,000 submissions using an ONC-provided dataset. 
  “Patient matching” in health IT describes the techniques used to identify and match
  the data about patients held by one healthcare provider with the data about the
  same patients held either within the same system or by another system (or many other
  systems). The inability to successfully match patients to any and all of their data
  records can impede interoperability, resulting in patient safety risks and decreased
  provider efficiency.    “Many experts across the healthcare system have long identified
  the ability to match patients efficiently, accurately, and to scale as a critical
  interoperability need for the nation’s growing health IT infrastructure.  This challenge
  was an important step towards better understanding the current landscape,” said
  Don Rucker, M.D., national coordinator for health information technology.    Winners
  include:    Best “F-score” (a measure of accuracy that factors in both precision
  and recall):  <ul>    <li>First Place ($25,000): Vynca</li>    <li>Second Place
  ($20,000): PICSURE</li>    <li>Third Place ($15,000): Information Softworks</li>  </ul>  Best
  First Run ($5,000): Information Softworks    Best Recall ($5,000): PICSURE    Best
  Precision ($5,000): Ocuvera    Each winner employed widely different methods.  
  PICSURE used an algorithm based on the Fellegi-Sunter (1969) method for probabilistic
  record matching and performed a significant amount of manual review. Vynca used
  a stacked model that combined the predictions of eight different models. They reported
  that they manually reviewed less than .001 percent of the records. Although Information
  Softworks also used a Fellegi-Sunter-based enterprise master patient index (EMPI)
  system with some additional tuning, they also reported extremely limited manual
  review.    The dataset and scoring platform used in the challenge will remain available
  for students, researchers, or anyone else interested in additional analysis and
  algorithm development, and can be accessed via the <a id="anch_30" class="external-link"
