description: The pace of technology change is arguably not slowing down and the proliferation
  of emerging technology-based capabilities to the global population is continuing
  to cause global effects.  We are interested in what lies ahead for the world 10
  years from now, and what challenges and/or opportunities will be presented to Special
  Operations Forces (SOF). We are interested in the impacts of technological innovation
  in both military technology and civilian society around the globe.    SOCOM is interested
  in what lies ahead for the world 10 years from now, and what challenges or opportunities
  will be presented to Special Operations Forces. We are interested in the impacts
  of technological innovation in the civilian society around the globe. What new or
  evolved technology will have the greatest impact, either as a challenge or as an
  opportunity, for Special Operation Forces in 2027? How is daily life for humans
  around the world going to differ from today? What innovations will industry invent,
  which will shape society 10 years from now? How will technologies become disruptive
  by themselves or converged with other technologies?   What are the economic, social,
  and military effects created by this technological evolution? We want to know how
  you see the world in 2027 and the critical impacts it might pose for Special Operations
  Forces.
