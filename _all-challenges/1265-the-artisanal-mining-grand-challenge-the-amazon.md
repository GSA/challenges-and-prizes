### Description

#### Overview

The **Artisanal Mining Grand Challenge: the Amazon** is a global call for solutions awarding more than $1 million in prizes and support for innovations to make artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in the Amazon more environmentally responsible and socially equitable.

Conservation X Labs (CXL) is administering the Challenge, with funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Microsoft, and ESRI, and technical input from the Center for Amazonian Scientific Innovation (CINCIA) and strategic implementation from the USAID/Peru Prevent project - Combating Environmental Crimes (Prevent).

We are seeking innovations at the prototype or piloting stage that: 

* **Safeguard ecosystems** and prevent, remediate, and restore impacts from ASGM at mining sites on biodiversity, water resources, and human health; 
* **Optimize responsible supply chains** to increase transparency and traceability and enable gold purchasing that is environmentally responsible and socially equitable from the point of origin to its final sale;
* **Promote and sustain formalization** of miners in the ASGM sector to achieve environmental and social safeguards and regulatory compliance.

The goal of the Challenge is to provide promising innovators with funding and support to help innovations achieve environmental and social impact, become financially sustainable, and scale. Participating in this Challenge offers a number of benefits beyond just funding and monetary prizes, including access to a network of experts and leaders in the space; the opportunity to meet and learn from peers working on cutting-edge products and tools; mentorship on business and product development; opportunities to conduct field-testing and receive feedback from users and customers; and recognition and validation from our world-class evaluation panel.

### Prizes

#### Prize Breakdown

The USD $1,150,000 prize purse will be distributed accordingly: 

* **$600,000** made in grants to Challenge finalists to support field-testing and innovation development (including the financing of equipment, travel, and labor) in March 2022. Grants will be a minimum of $30,000 and Challenge administrators anticipate making approximately 10 to 20 awards contingent on applicant’s eligibility and compliance with USAID and CXL and the Prevent projects’ rules, regulations, and policies;
* **$350,000** provided in technical assistance and in-kind services through the acceleration program (March thru August 2022); and
* **$200,000** in the form of two $100,000 no-strings attached prizes to the highest performing finalists at the end of the acceleration program in October 2022.

Challenge administrators have allocated **50% of the grants** for Challenge finalists for applicants from partner countries in the USAID Amazon Regional Environment Program (Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname) though field-testing may only occur in Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, and/or Suriname.

#### Non-monetary Prizes

* **$350,000** provided in technical assistance and in-kind services through the acceleration program (March thru August 2022)

### Rules

The competition seeks to inspire and identify innovations that:

* Demonstrate potential to be financially sustainable and mitigate the negative environmental and social impacts within the ASGM sector
* At a minimum, are ready to be field-tested in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Suriname, and/or Guyana and have proof of the potential for adoption by users and/or customers

The competition is NOT looking for: 

* Solutions that are in the concept or research phase
* Pure policy solutions
* Purely technical assistance, training, or capacity building programs 

An innovation is a new or improved product or process (or combination thereof) that differs significantly from the unit’s previous products or processes and that has been made available to potential users (product) or brought into use by the unit (process). For the purposes of this competition, an innovation is a process, tool, approach, and/or a digital solution that has a functional prototype or proof of concept ready to be piloted by the closing of the application deadline. 

There are many good ideas and innovations out there! However, this competition is specifically designed to support innovations that have an existing solution ready for piloting, fit within the overall scope and goals of the Challenge, and can be applied in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Suriname, and/or Guyana.

In addition, eligible applications must meet the following minimum criteria. Your application may be disqualified from the competition if it does not meet all of the following criteria:

* The application is complete and submitted by the deadline.
* The application is in English or Spanish language. 
* The innovation described in the application is within the Challenge scope. 
* The innovation is a tangible tool, device, or process by the closing of the application deadline. 
* The innovation is at an application readiness stage (ARL) stage between 3 to 6 (ranging from a proof of concept to solutions that have demonstrated a prototype in an operational environment). 
* The innovation is ready to be field-tested or piloted in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Suriname, and/or Guyana. If a solution is for ASGM miners, field-testing may not occur with any illegal mining activity as determined by the jurisdiction of the test site. 
* The application is submitted by an organization, including US organizations, non-US organizations, partner government entities, or public international organizations. This includes non-governmental organizations (international, national and local), private sector entities, universities / academia, community organizations that include indigenous groups, cooperatives / associations and other civil society partners. Partner government entities may apply but can only receive in-kind assistance. Individuals are not eligible to apply. Multiple organizations may collaborate to submit an application, but one organization must be named to assume the financial and administrative responsibility of the award.
* The innovation cannot be purely a policy solution or technical assistance, training, and/or capacity building program. 
* The innovation cannot have received a cash prize through the 2019-2020 Global Artisanal Mining Grand Challenge administered by Conservation X Labs. Applicants from the Global Artisanal Mining Grand Challenge that did not receive a cash prize, including those that were finalists and semi-finalists are eligible to apply to the Artisanal Mining Grand Challenge: the Amazon. 

Additionally, shortlisted applicants will be invited to submit a more detailed application for a 6-month field-testing plan and innovation development, including a work plan and budget. To be eligible to receive funds, applicants must:

* Register with the US federal government and acquire a DUNS number (detailed instructions for registering for a DUNS can be found at https://2012-2017.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1868/302sao.pdf as well as this e-module: https://extra.usaid.gov/partner-learning/duns/presentation_content/external_files/E-Module%20DUNS%20Registration%20-%20Slides,%20Notes.pdfl);
