  may not be:</strong>  <ol start="3">   <li>A federal entity or federal employee
  acting within the scope of employment. However, an individual or entity shall
  not be deemed ineligible because the individual or entity used federal facilities
  or consulted with federal employees during a competition if the facilities and
  employees are made available to all individuals and entities participating in
  the competition on an equitable basis.</li>  </ol>  <p>Participants agree to assume
  any and all risks and waive claims against the federal government and its related
  entities, except in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage,

  liability insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility, to cover a third
  party for death, bodily injury, property damage, or loss resulting from an activity
  carried out in connection with participation in this competition.    Participants
  are hereby advised that diligent care must be taken to avoid the appearance
  of government endorsement of competition participation and submission. Moreover,
  as is customary when doing business with the federal government, participants
  may not refer to GSA’s use of your submission (be it product or service) in
  any commercial advertising or similar promotions in a manner that states or
  implies that the product or service being used is endorsed or preferred by GSA
  or any other element of the federal government, or that the federal government
  considers it to be superior to other products or services.</p><p>The intent of this
  policy is to prevent the appearance of federal government bias toward any one
  product or service.    Participants agree that GSA’s trademarks, logos, service
  marks, trade names, or the fact that GSA awarded a prize to a Participant, shall
  not be used by the Participant to imply direct GSA endorsement of Participant

description: '<p>Join with the Office of Digital Innovation and Strategy to develop a
  smart technology solution in the form of an Application, Application Programming
  Interface (APIs), and/or Data Mashup for Acquisition, Travel and Public Building
  Service (PBS).</p><p>    The purpose of this notice is to announce a software programming
  and data innovation competition hosted by GSA’s Office of Digital Innovation and
  Strategy that will be held on May 8th, 2015. The competition will be open from 9:00
  a.m. until 4:30 p.m.  The competition details can be viewed at <a href="http://open.gsa.gov/Digital-Innovation-Hackathon/">http://open.gsa.gov/Digital-Innovation-Hackathon/</a>
  .  </p><p>The goal of this competition is to ask the public and academia to develop smart
  technology solutions in the form of an application, Application Programming Interface
  (API), and/or data mashup that has the capability to providing GSA with key insights
  and recommendations for future enhancements.  GSA will challenge software developers
  and designers to create a solution using sample GSA data.</p>   <p> <strong>FOR FURTHER
  INFORMATION CONTACT:</strong> Ms. Cindy A. Smith at cindya.smith@gsa.gov or 816-823-5291.    In
  this competition, the public is asked to develop a technology-driven solution using
  GSA data that allows an agency to identify opportunities for improvements and transparency. 
  As such, GSA challenges the public to create a solution using GSA data that could
  be replicated across government to every agency, using their own data.  Sample data
  sets with GSA data will be provided.</p>    <p><strong>DETAILS OF CHALLENGE:  </strong>Design
  and create a digital interactive solution in the form of an application, Application
  Programming Interface (API), and/or data mashup that utilizes federal data collected
  by GSA. The technology solution should be innovative!  GSA does not want an analysis
  tool that tells what is already known.  This should be a forward-thinking solution
  that enhances transparency.</p>    The solution should be a data-driven solution to
  provide meaningful insights that can help drive smarter decisions by federal employees. 
  The ultimate goal is to help federal agencies use data to its fullest, share data
  with all agencies, and become transparent to the American Public.    The solution
  should accomplish two tasks:  <ul>   <li>Visually display or transmit data in a
  way that will enhance the way GSA works; and,</li>  </ul>  <ul>   <li>Through analysis
  of the data identify relationships if they exist, and provide valuable insights
  that could be gained through improved data collection efforts.</li>  </ul>  GSA
  will assign teams randomly based on the number of participants on the day of the
  event.  No pre-determined team arrangements will be permitted.  Modification to
  team make-up may occur based on team skill make-up at the direction of the competition
  host.    <strong>DATA:  </strong>Participants will be provided current GSA public
  data sets to use in designing their solution on the day of the event.  Prior to
  the event, the GitHub page, <a href="http://open.gsa.gov/Digital-Innovation-Hackathon/">open.gsa.gov/Digital-Innovation-Hackathon/</a>,
  will be updated with project details and criteria.    Hackathon projects may include
  the following:  <ul>   <li>IAE CO Dashboard – A Dashboard that pulls together Contract
  Report Data, with Vendor information along with Contract Performance information
  in one location.</li>   <li>Travel Tool – Improvements/Enhancements to the existing
  Tool.</li>   <li>Public Data Listing Formatting on GitHub – A new way to view all
  of GSA’s data assets.</li>   <li>Socio-Economic Advisor – Access to specific Vendor
  data (Products, Services, etc.).</li>   <li>Energy Use/Cost by Building/Effect on
  TSS – Identify drivers and relationships.</li>  </ul>  <strong>REGISTRATION:  </strong>Registration
