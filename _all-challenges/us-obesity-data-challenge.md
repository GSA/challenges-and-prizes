description: '<p><b>Calling all data enthusiasts and innovators
  to harness existing open health data to develop visualizations and tools for health
  care providers and public health officials to better tackle obesity!</b>    <strong>All
  entries are due by 9 AM ET, Monday, Aug. 3, 2015</strong></p><p><i>The U.S. Obesity
  Data Challenge is a parallel, but separate prize-based competition. Learn more about
  the Obesity Data Challenge led by National Health Service (NHS) England and their
  organizing partner, Rewired State </i><a href="http://obesitychallenge.rewiredstate.org"><i>here</i></a>.  <h2><b>THE
  PROBLEM</b></h2>  Obesity is a common problem for the United States, U.K., and indeed
  for much of the developed world. Two in three adults in the U.S. and 64% of U.K.
  adults are overweight or obese (Ogden, 2014). But the epidemic is not limited to
  the developed world; about one billion adults in the developing world are overweight
  or obese (PHE, 2014). Obesity contributes to a host of other diseases, including
  increased risk of heart attack, strokes and diabetes.</p><p>Societal, economic, and
  cultural conditions all contribute to the obesity epidemic. These factors include
  (but are not limited to) personal food choices, cost and access to healthful foods,
  individual physical activity, genetic predisposition, and other demographic and
  environmental risk factors.</p><p>Currently, volumes of data exist, but they aren’t
  always put to use for the benefit of individual patients or their communities –
  or, just as commonly, data are used selectively, without the full power that comes
  from combining data from multiple sources. Many are unaware that relevant data even
  exists, and few have the capability to combine or visualize data in sophisticated
  ways. With communities coming together to address obesity as a critical issue, it’s
  time to provide better tools that put these data to work<b>.</b>  </p><p><h2><b>THE CHALLENGE</b></h2>  Challenge
  participants should utilize and mash up open data to develop new data visualization
  tools to give communities, local health officials, patients and practitioners new
  means to improve population health. Winning solutions will enable public health
  and health care professionals to help patients and families address the obesity
  epidemic at a personal and community level.  Be creative with this, the sky’s the
  limit for your mashup.    <b>A FEW HELPFUL  GUIDELINES:</b>  <ul>   <li>The data
  used to develop a solution, tool, or visualization for this challenge <b>must include
  at least one open data set from a U.S. government resource. </b></li>   <li>While
  your chosen datasets could be directly related to health, we are interested in seeing
  what you can create from cross-sector, cross-departmental data (e.g., geographic
  location, availability of healthy food choices, possibilities for exercise, hereditary
  traits of demographic populations, or personal health inputs).</li>   <li>There
  are a number of tools already in the marketplace that simply tracking diet or exercise,
  so <b>we’re looking for more complex solutions that offer particularly new and creative
  approaches </b>to supporting individuals and populations in better health incorporating
  multiple data points and open data sets.</li>   <li><b>All solutions should ensure
  the confidentiality of individuals</b>.</li>   <li><b>Any data used should be openly
  available </b>and thus conforming to information governance best practice.</li>  </ul>  <b>A

  making actionable suggestions to patients and families dealing with obesity?</li>   <li>How
  can health care providers and local health officials share comprehensive data on
  community access to healthy food choices and physical activity options along with
  demographic variables for meaningful conversations with patients and families?</li>   <li>How
  are the various contributory factors to obesity related?</li>   <li>What can we
  learn from relationships among where we live and obesity, perhaps considering food
  deserts, poor access to affordable healthy foods, a dearth of public recreational
  activities, and socioeconomic statistics?</li>   <li>How can patients be supported
  through informed choices using data on community access to food and physical activity?</li>   <li>How
  can cross-sectional data empower patients dealing with obesity to find solutions
  that fit their needs?</li>   <li>Can we drive recommendations for obese populations
  using personal demographic inputs, known rates of obesity for those demographics,
  and geography specific data about rates of fast food consumption versus locations
  for healthy food options?</li>   <li>How can data support people to change their
  behaviors in ways that prevent obesity or improve their existing condition?</li>  </ul>  <h2><b>SUBMISSION</b></h2>  <b>HOW
