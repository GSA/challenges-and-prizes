ideaSubmitFormInstruction: 'To enter the Challenge, participants must complete the
  nomination form. The nomination form is a combination of short answer responses,
  checkbox responses, and assurances.    Nomination information includes:  <ol>    <li>The
  size of the nominee’s adult patient population defined as the number of adult patients
  served during the reporting year regardless of diagnosis, a summary of known patient
  demographics (e.g., age distribution), a description of some population characteristics
  that might present significant challenges and barriers in controlling hypertension
  (e.g., rural/urban location, % who belong to a minority population, percent whose
  primary language is not English, percent enrolled in Medicaid, and percent who have
  no health insurance), and any noteworthy patient population characteristics. The
  reporting year (12-months) should reflect the most currently available data with
  an end date no earlier than December 31, 2016.</li>    <li class="download">The
  percent of the nominee’s adult patient population identified above that were seen
  during the reporting year and had a hypertension diagnosis (i.e., hypertension prevalence).
  There are an estimated 11 million people who are unaware of their hypertension.
  Most of these people are hiding in plain sight—they are in clinical treatment with
  elevated blood pressure documented, but hypertension neither diagnosed nor treated.
  Nominees selected as finalists will have their reported hypertension prevalence
  (i.e., percentage of their practice or system population with the condition) assessed
  for alignment with their predicted hypertension prevalence.  Initially, a rough
  estimate of the nominee’s predicted hypertension prevalence will be calculated using
  the reported age distribution of their patient population and hypertension prevalence
  findings from national studies, using the <a title="Hypertension Prevalence Estimator
  Tool" href="http://nccd-mh-dev.cdc.gov/files/MH_HTN_Estimator.xlsm" target="_blank">Million
  Hearts<sup>®</sup> Hypertension Prevalence Estimator Tool [Excel-88K]</a>. If the
  nominee’s reported prevalence varies considerably from this rough estimate, the
  nominee may be asked to describe possible reasons for this disparity during the
  data validation process. If the reported hypertension prevalence is extreme and
  there is not a justifiable reason, the nominee may be excluded from further participation
  in the Challenge.</li>    <li>The hypertension control rate should be for the provider’s
  or health system’s entire adult hypertensive patient population, not limited to
  a sample. Examples of ineligible data submissions include hypertension control rates
  that are limited to treatment cohorts from research studies or pilot studies, patients
  limited to a specific age range (such as 18-35), or patients enrolled in limited
  scale quality improvement projects.</li>    <li>The nominee’s current hypertension
  control rate among their hypertensive population identified above during the reporting
  year.  In addition, the hypertension control rate during the previous reporting
  year is also required.  If the current reporting year is January 1, 2016 through
  December 31, 2016, then the previous reporting year is January 1, 2015 through December
  31, 2015.</li>    <li>In determining the hypertension control rate, CDC defines
  “hypertension control” as a blood pressure reading &lt; 140 mmHg systolic and &lt;
  90 mmHg diastolic among adult hypertensive patients.</li>    <li>A description of
  clinic systems or processes that support hypertension control.  Completion of a
  checklist of sustainable clinic systems or processes that support hypertension control.
  These may include provider or patient incentives, dashboards, staffing characteristics,
  electronic record keeping systems, reminder or alert systems, clinician reporting,
  service modifications, etc.  Checkbox responses may be supplemented by a short answer
  response.  Supporting information about clinic systems is encouraged but not required.</li>    <li>The
  nominee must agree to:  <ol type="a">    <li>Participate in a data validation process
  (described below), accept the award if selected, and participate in award activities.</li>    <li>Complete,
  without revisions, the CDC contractor’s required HIPAA compliance Business Associate
  Agreement form and/or other forms that may be required by applicable law.</li>    <li>Participate
  in a 1 to 2 hour interview or similar activity to gather information about their
  hypertension control strategies, and work with CDCC on the review of material to
  share clinical strategies. Strategies used by Champions that support hypertension
  control may be written into a success story, placed on this website, and attributed
  to Champions.</li>    <li>Assume any and all risks and waive claims against the
  federal government and its related entities except in the case of willful misconduct,
  for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue or profits, whether
  direct, indirect or consequences, arising from participation in this prize contest,
  whether the injury, death, damage or loss arises through negligence or otherwise.</li>    <li>Indemnify
  the federal government against third party claims for damages arising from or related
  to competition activities.</li>  </ol>  </li>  </ol>  Nominees not agreeing to each
  of these items on the nomination form will be excluded from the Challenge.  Paper
  responses will not be accepted.    The estimated burden for completing the nomination

description: 'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), located within
  the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces the launch of the Million
  Hearts<sup>®</sup> Hypertension Control Challenge.    Million Hearts<sup>® </sup>is
  a national initiative to prevent one million heart attacks and strokes by 2022.
  Achieving this goal means 10 million more Americans must have their blood pressure
  under control. Million Hearts<sup>®</sup> is working to control high blood pressure
  through clinical approaches, such as using health information technology to its
  fullest potential and integrating team-based approaches to health care, and community
  approaches, such as strengthening tobacco control and promoting physical activity.    To
  support improved blood pressure control, HHS/CDC is announcing the 2017 Million
  Hearts<sup>® </sup>Hypertension Control Challenge.    This competition identifies
  practices, clinicians, and health systems that have worked with their patients to
  achieve hypertension control rates at or above 70% through innovations in health
  information technology and electronic health records, patient communication, and
  health care team approaches.    The nomination will be scored based on hypertension
  control rate and consistency of the control rate over the reporting year and the
  prior year, sustainable systems in the practice that support hypertension control,
  and consideration of patient population characteristics that might present significant
  challenges and barriers in controlling hypertension.    Nominees with the highest
  score will be required to participate in a two-phase process to verify their data.
  Nominees who are non-compliant or non-responsive with the data requests or timelines
  will be removed from further consideration.    Phase 1 includes verification of
  the hypertension prevalence and blood pressure control rate data submitted and a
  background check. For nominees whose Phase 1 data is verified as accurate, phase
  2 consists of a medical chart review. In addition, background checks will be conducted
  by an independent source for individual or small practice nominees to ensure there
  are no serious sanctions or that other misconduct has occurred (as outlined in the
  Eligibility section). For large providers or health systems, their background check
  policy and implementation will be reviewed for compliance with the individual background
  check protocol.  Some nominees may be eliminated base on these reviews.  In addition,
  a health system background check will include a search for The Joint Commission’s
  sanctions and current investigations for serious institutional misconduct (e.g.,
  investigations for professional medical misconduct).    Phase 2 of the validation,
  for nominees whose Phase 1 data is verified as accurate, consists of hypertension
  management validation via medical chart review.    <strong>Selecting the Champions</strong>    A
  CDC-sponsored panel of three to five experts consisting of HHS/CDC staff will review
  the nominations that pass phase 2 to select Champions. Final selection of Champions
  will take into account all the information from the nomination form, the background
  check, and data verification.  In the event of tie scores at any point in the selection
  process, geographic location may be taken into account to ensure a broad distribution
  of champions across rural or more populated areas, representing potentially underserved
  populations.    The first Round Finalists will be selected based on a composite
  score generated from the information on the nomination form. These nominees will
  participate in a data validation process.    Nominations will be scored and judged
  separately by size and type of nominee in the categories listed below. CDC does
  not guarantee that a specific proportion of Champions will be selected from each
  category.  <ul>    <li>Small individual providers or practices (500-49,999 covered
  lives)</li>    <li>Large providers or practices (50,000 or more covered lives)</li>    <li>Health
  Systems</li>  </ul>  The nomination will be scored based on two hypertension control
  rates: one for your most recent 12-month reporting period ending not earlier than
  December 31, 2016, and consistency with a previous rate for a 12-month period 1
  year before the current rate (at least 90% of score); sustainable systems in the
  practice that support hypertension control (up to 5% of score); and patient population
  characteristics that might present significant challenges and barriers in controlling
  hypertension (up to 5% of score).    Judges will confirm that there are no conflicts
  of interest with any nominees being considered as a Champion.    Some Champions
  will participate in a post-challenge telephone interview. The interview will include
  questions about the strategies employed by the individual or organization to achieve
  high rates of hypertension control, including barriers and facilitators for those
  strategies. The interview will focus on systems and processes and should not require
  preparation time by the Champion. The estimated time for the interview is two hours,
  which includes time to review the interview protocol with the interviewer, respond
  to the interview questions, and review a summary data about the Champion’s practices.
  The summary will be written as a success story and will be posted on the Million
  Hearts® website.    <strong>Success Stories</strong>    Past Champions have shared
  how they were successful at achieving high rates of hypertension control among their
  patient population.    Click or copy and paste the following link into your browser
