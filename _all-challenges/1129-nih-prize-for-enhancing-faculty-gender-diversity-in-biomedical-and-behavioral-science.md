  Women continue to be underrepresented at nearly every institution of higher
  education in the United States in the fields of biomedical, behavioral
  sciences, and engineering. This is particularly true among mid- to
  senior-level faculty ranks.


  The Prize for Enhancing Faculty Gender Diversity seeks to recognize those institutions whose biomedical and behavioral science departments, centers, or divisions have achieved sustained improvement in gender diversity.  Understanding that there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution to enhancing diversity in academia and that ideas based on evidence are necessary to achieve systemic change, this prize will acknowledge and recognize transformative approaches, systems, projects, programs, and processes that have successfully enhanced and sustained gender diversity within an institution.


  We recognize that challenges are faced by all underrepresented groups. Women of color, who are at the intersection of gender and race/ethnicity, face unique obstacles and are especially underrepresented as biomedical faculty members and in the leadership ranks. Although this competition focuses on improving gender diversity broadly for all women, the NIH is also interested in institutional approaches that address the underrepresentation of faculty with intersecting identities.


  Critical to this prize competition is the identification of best practices, the sharing of lessons learned, and the delineation of evidence-based approaches that can be broadly translated to, and replicated by, other institutions vis-à-vis an NIH-supported national toolkit. Submissions to this prize competition may inform the development of the toolkit, which will be designed to assist other institutions or academic groups with issues of inclusion and help to create environments that facilitate achievement. Because this prize competition recognizes achievement through approaches that have already been applied, such interventions must have been implemented prior to the launch date of this prize competition.


  In addition to public recognition for their efforts in enhancing gender diversity, this NIH prize competition will also award a prize of $50,000 to each institution (up to ten institutions) with the best overall systemic approaches. The total prize purse for this competition is $500,000. Additional submissions may be recognized as honorable mentions with non-monetary awards. Winning participants and honorable mentions may be invited to present their approaches at an NIH Office of Research for Women’s Health hosted scientific symposium.

  #### Total Prize Pool


  $500,000


  #### Prize Breakdown


  Up to ten (10) winners will be selected, with each winning up to $50,000. 



  Although gender inequality in science, medicine, and engineering faculty occurs across the United States, patterns of challenges emerge between institutions. Recognizing that disparities exist amongst institutions, judges will evaluate entries in two pools to allow for fair competition. Five of the ten prizes will be awarded to low or limited-resource institutions.  Submissions from low or limited-resource institutions will be judged against one another to select those five winners.


  #### Non-monetary Prizes


  Additional submissions may be recognized as honorable mentions with non-monetary awards. Winning participants and honorable mentions may be invited to present their approaches at an NIH Office on Research for Women’s Health hosted scientific symposium. NIH will not provide travel funds for the event.


  #### Award Approving Official


  The Award Approving Official will be Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the National Institutes of Health.


  #### Payment of the Prize


  Prizes awarded under this prize competition will be paid by electronic funds transfer to an eligible institution (as further defined in the Eligibility Rules for Participating in the Prize Competition section) and may be subject to Federal income taxes. Awardees will need to provide an institutional bank account and routing information in order to receive the award funds; prize funds will not be paid to individuals. HHS/NIH will comply with the Internal Revenue Service withholding and reporting requirements, where applicable. The NIH reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (a) cancel, suspend, and/or modify this prize competition, or any part of it, for any reason, and/or (b) not award any prizes if no submissions are deemed worthy.

  #### Judging Panel and Criteria


  A panel of federal employees serving as judges will review the prize competition submissions based on the following criteria: 


  1. **(40%) Impact**:
     A single approach or combination of approaches will be evaluated based on the magnitude and extent of impact seen on improving gender diversity at an institution and/or department. Consideration of faculty of intersecting identities, such as women of color, is encouraged in describing the impact to gender diversity. Impact can include qualitative elements like improvement of climate and inclusiveness of the environment.  Impact can also include quantitative improvements such as increased rates of female faculty recruitment, retention, and equitable pay across genders. 
  2. **(25%) Metrics**: 

     * You must submit the following **minimum metrics** for the institution, school, division, or department in order to apply. This will ensure a common data set across all institutions.

       * **Gender baseline**:  Aggregate faculty demographics for the institution, school, or department to which the approaches or interventions apply, at the pre-implementation stage.  Gender data should be provided in proportions and in absolute numbers.
       * **Gender post implementation**:  Aggregate faculty demographics for the institution, school, or department to which the approaches or interventions apply, at post-implementation or for the current landscape.  Data should be provided in proportions and in absolute numbers.
     * Data will be evaluated for its quality and strength, as well as synthesis and analysis in drawing specific conclusions.
     * Data will be evaluated on whether it supports multiple elements of impact, as described in the Impact criterion above. 
     * The institution’s use of data analysis and data trends to reveal both gaps and improvements in gender diversity 
  3. **(15%) Sustainability**: The extent to which effective efforts to enhance diversity at an institution can be regularly monitored, sustained, and are long lasting.

  4. **(10%) Scalability**: The potential for approaches to be broadly implemented in other departments within the same institution, or be scaled up. The ease with which a process could be generalizable and adapted for different situations.

  5. **(10%) Lessons Learned**:  The submission identifies lessons learned during implementation and clearly explains what challenges were faced and how they were addressed. Honest comments about roadblocks encountered are valuable.
