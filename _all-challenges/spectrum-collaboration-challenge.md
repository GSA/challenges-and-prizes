description: The DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) is the first-of-its-kind
  collaborative machine-learning competition to overcome scarcity in the radio frequency
  (RF) spectrum. Today, spectrum is managed by dividing it into rigid, exclusively
  licensed bands. This human-driven process is not adaptive to the dynamics of supply
  and demand, and thus cannot exploit the full potential capacity of the spectrum.
  In SC2, competitors will reimagine a new, more efficient wireless paradigm in which
  radio networks autonomously collaborate to dynamically determine how the spectrum
  should be used moment to moment.    The team whose radio design most reliably achieves
  successful communication in the presence of other competing radios could win as
  much as $3,500,000.    Across the nation and around the world, the wireless revolution
  is fueling a voracious demand for access to the radio frequency (RF) spectrum. In
  the civilian sector, consumer devices from smartphones to wearable fitness recorders
  to smart kitchen appliances are competing for bandwidth. In the military there is
  a growing reliance on unmanned platforms, from underwater sensors to satellites,
  and a push for broadband connectivity for every member of every Service. Managing
  this increasing demand, while combating what appears to be a looming scarcity of
  RF spectrum is a serious problem for our nation.    Today’s approach, which is nearly
  a century old, isolates wireless systems by dividing the spectrum into rigid exclusively
  licensed bands, which are allocated over large, geographically defined regions.
  This approach rations access to the spectrum in exchange for the guarantee of interference-free
  communication. However, it is human-driven and not adaptive to the dynamics of supply
  and demand. At any given time, many allocated bands are unused by licensees while
  other bands are overwhelmed, thus squandering the spectrum’s enormous capacity and
  unnecessarily creating conditions of scarcity.    The Spectrum Collaboration Challenge
  (SC2), aims to ensure that the exponentially growing number of military and civilian
  wireless devices will have full access to the increasingly crowded electromagnetic
  spectrum. Competitors will reimagine spectrum access strategies and develop a new
  wireless paradigm in which radio networks will autonomously collaborate and reason
  about how to share the RF spectrum, avoiding interference and jointly exploiting
  opportunities to achieve the most efficient use of the available spectrum. SC2 teams
  will develop these breakthrough capabilities by taking advantage of recent advances
  in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, and the expanding capacities
  of software-defined radios. Ultimately this competition aims not only to challenge
  innovators in academia and business to produce breakthroughs in collaborative AI,
  but also to catalyze a new spectrum paradigm that can help usher in an era of spectrum
  abundance.
