### Description
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg .challenge-section}

<p>The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA(ALT)) is announcing the fifth iteration of the Army Expeditionary Technology Search &ndash; xTechSearch &ndash;&nbsp; prize competition. xTechSearch will highlight opportunities for small businesses to collaborate with the Army to tackle the most critical Army modernization challenges.</p>
<p>The ASA(ALT) recognizes that the Army must enhance engagements with the small businesses, by: (1) understanding the spectrum of technologies being developed commercially that may benefit the Army; (2) integrating the sector of small business innovators into the Army&rsquo;s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) ecosystem; and (3) providing mentorship and expertise to accelerate, mature, and transition technologies of interest to the Army.</p>
<p>The Army xTechSearch program will provide increasing non-dilutive seed prizes to select small businesses to proceed in the competition.&nbsp; Ultimately ten (10) small business finalists will receive awards of $120,000 each and be invited to&nbsp; demonstrate a proof-of-concept of their dual-use technologies pertaining to Army challenges. Final demonstrations will take place at the 2021 Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Global Force Symposium and Exhibition in March 2021 in Huntsville, AL.&nbsp; A grand prize winner will be selected and awarded an additional $250,000 prize.&nbsp; Details on the prize structure are listed below in this announcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The xTechSearch program will also strives to integrate these small businesses into the Army&rsquo;s S&amp;T ecosystem by providing research opportunities with Army labs, including authorized access to the Army&rsquo;s organic intellectual and technical capital.&nbsp; Every small business idea submitted will receive detailed operational and technical feedback from Army stakeholders.&nbsp; Participating companies will have access to training, mentorship and other support infrastructure as they progress through the contest to determine how best to align their technology solutions with real users and buyers within the Army.&nbsp; Finalists will be entered into the xTech Accelerator to receive intensive mentorship and access to networking events to help grow their companies for Army and commercial users.&nbsp; xTechSearch is an opportunity for businesses to pitch novel technology solutions &ndash; a new application for an existing technology or an entirely new technology concept &ndash; to the Army.</p>
<p>The authority of this program is 15 United States Code (USC) &sect;3719.</p>
