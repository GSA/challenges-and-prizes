<!-- Description start -->
### Description
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg .challenge-section}

<p>Racial and ethnic disparities in health are widespread across the United States. The Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) program demonstrates success in addressing these disparities and promoting health equity by working with many and various communities and carrying out culturally tailored interventions. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/state-local-programs/reach/index.htm">Learn more about the REACH Program</a>.</p>
<p>The REACH Lark Award honors extraordinary individuals, organizations, or community coalitions associated with the REACH program for advancing the science and practice of improving health equity to eliminate health disparities at the national, state, or local levels. As participants in the award process, applicants describe how they assisted with and successfully carried out culturally tailored interventions that led to reduced health disparities in chronic conditions including hypertension, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, or obesity and associated risk behaviors of physical inactivity, poor nutrition, or smoking.</p>
<p>This award highlights how diverse communities worked together to address health disparities and achieve one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addressed preventable risk behaviors (tobacco use, poor nutrition, and physical inactivity).</li>
<li>Linked community and clinical efforts to increase access to health care and preventive care programs at the community level.</li>
<li>Supported implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of practice- and evidence-based strategies related to tobacco use prevention, nutrition, physical activity, or community-clinical linkages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nominations for this award can help further the goals of the REACH program by documenting and disseminating the innovative or unique interventions that led to reduced health disparities.</p>
