### Description
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg .challenge-section}

<p>The US Army is requesting whitepapers from interested recipients describing how to produce and characterize defects in ceramic armor. The objective is to illustrate a process that will identify the impact of various defects of differing sizes on the ballistic performance of hard armor plates.&nbsp; Defect types shall consist of: inclusions or voids, healed green defects, surface flaws, as well as other identified imperfections in the ceramic armor. Defects shall be in the size range of approximately 0.03-0.08 inches in at least 2 dimensions, i.e. elongated cracks or healed green defects, spherical defects or voids, etc. The recipient will describe a proof of concept process using high resolution Computer Tomography (CT) or any similar method.&nbsp; The high resolution characterization must be at a resolution sufficient to accurately classify the defects and identify their exact location to enable accurate ballistic testing.&nbsp; The description of the characterization process shall include the instrumentation, resolution, scan speed, and other CT variables considered important. The Army will review whitepapers for the overall alignment of the proposed investigation, achievable quality of the defect characterization, completeness of the plan, and proposed schedule. Based on the completeness of the proposed plan, a contract may be awarded to carry out a more robust investigation.</p>
