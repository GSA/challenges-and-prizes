<p>Agreement to Terms. By responding to this announcement, the participant agrees to comply with and be bound by the rules (including these terms and conditions) of this prize challenge and the decisions of the Government, which rules and decisions are binding and final in all matters relating to this challenge.</p>
<p>Security Requirements. By responding to this announcement, the participant agrees to comply with the DoDM 5200.01 (all volumes) and any revisions to this manual.</p>
<p>Participation by Government Support Contractors. Government support contractors will assist in the review of any data provided by participants. A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) has been signed by the support contractors with the Government that precludes them from disclosing any proprietary data outside of the Government. If participants desire a separate NDA with the Government support contractors, participants should submit a NDA form, along with instructions, with their initial qualification application.</p>
<p>Other Transaction Authority (OTA). At the Government&rsquo;s discretion, the Government may choose to award an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) award (under 10 U.S. Code, Section 2371 or 2371b) under these authorities to any chosen participant in this prize challenge. In the case of an award under 10 U.S. Code, Section 2371b, a successful prototype project may result in the further award of a follow-on OTA without additional competition. The case of an award under any of the authorities mentioned, significant quantities may be needed for field-testing.</p>
<p>NOTE: The Government may negotiate Government Purpose Rights when requesting proposals if an Other Transaction Authority award is contemplated.</p>
<p>Malware. Each participant warrants that the submission is virus free and free of malware.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property (IP) Rights.

L. No. 110-175.

All FOIA requests received by NAVSEA are processed in accordance with 10 C.F.R. Part 1004.&nbsp; Participants will be notified of any FOIA requests for their submissions in accordance with 29 C.F.R. &sect; 70.26.&nbsp; Participants may then have the opportunity to review materials and work with a NAVSEA FOIA representative prior to the release of materials.</p>
