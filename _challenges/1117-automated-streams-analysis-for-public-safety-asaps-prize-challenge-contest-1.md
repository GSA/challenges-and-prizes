  The Public Safety Communications Research Division of the National Institute
  of Standards and Technology is conducting the Automated Streams Analysis for
  Public Safety (ASAPS) Prize Challenge, authorized under Section 105 of the
  America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (Pub. L. No 111-358), as codified
  in 15 U.S.C. § 3719.


  This challenge anticipates awarding prizes to challenge contestants who submit
  innovative approaches that address information extraction across ASAPS
  multimodal data streams and perform fusion in real time across extracted data
  to generate actionable data reports about simulated and staged emergency
  events. One of the most important objectives of this program is to demonstrate
  how data can be used to enable decision support tools and capabilities for
  public safety. This challenge is a nationwide innovation contest taking place
  throughout 2020, 2021, and 2022. The challenge is anticipated to be
  administered in four discrete contests. In the context of multiple contests,
  these are the official rules for Contest 1 only.


  Contest 1 will focus on developing innovative “plans of attack” focused on
  data extraction and fusion, refining and focusing the details relevant to the
  ASAPS Challenge’s problem statement, partnering between contestants to form
  highly qualified teams, and encouraging collaborative and creative thought
  around potential approaches to developing solutions. NIST anticipates awarding
  up to $150,000 in cash to winning contestants in Contest 1. In addition,
  contestants will be familiarized with the development data set and version 1.0
  of the test harness and encouraged to provide feedback for potential updates
  in advance of the second contest.

  The area of real-time automated analytics is understudied – especially with
  regards to the analytic fusion of multiple sources of unstructured information
  in real-time. The future of public safety demands automated solutions to
  analyze live data, provide improved situational awareness, and alert and
  inform decision making.


  Extracting information from video, audio and textual communications, social
  media, and sensors presents a significant analytic challenge. It is virtually
  impossible for humans to co-analyze these data streams in real-time, and,
  currently, there are few automated tools to analyze these types of
  unstructured data in real-time and virtually no automated tools to create
  dynamic analytic models of public safety emergencies as emergency situations
  evolve.


  With the maturation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, specialized
  architectures and processors for AI applications, cloud computing, high-speed
  communications networks and streaming data resources and protocols, it is now
  possible to create automated tools to assist public safety organizations in
  analyzing the increasingly large amounts of information at their fingertips to
  help them make the most informed decisions based on a comprehensive analysis
  of the data available. Such tools will help distill, structure, and present
  the quickly evolving information from a multitude of data streams to public
  safety organizations in a way that supports time-critical decision making and
  serves as an essential force multiplier.


  Due to the multitude of sensors and devices being used in public safety along
  with communications data collected in operations and contributed by the
  public, and the multi-modal nature of all of these data streams, transforming
  data, especially unstructured data, into information in real-time is one of
  the key technology gaps that must be bridged to achieve advances in this area.
  The available technology is insufficient to bridge this technological gap
  because:


  * Most automated data analysis tools have been developed for use with archival
  data and focus on post-event forensic analysis.

  * Few analytic technologies focus on a moving representation of live streaming
  data that is updated over time, and that can be used to show temporal changes
  in the analysis.

  * Tools that make data available to first responders in real-time are heavily
  weighted towards a visual representation of responder location and structured
  reporting of known emergency communications.

  * Few public safety emergency analysis tools exist that provide an effective
  real-time automated analysis and fusion of information from unstructured
  public safety communications streams and sensor- and citizen-generated data
  streams.


  Note that while public safety organizations must often grapple with answering
  the who, what, when, and where of emergencies, the research supported by this
  Challenge focuses only on the what, when, and where aspects of streaming data
  analysis and specifically excludes identity-related technologies such as
  facial and voice biometrics which are considered out of scope for this
  research program - with the exception of technology to maintain scene-relative
  identification of people/vehicle/object/place entities involved in emergencies
  in order to associate activities with the entities they are involved with.
  This focus of the Challenge is because the area of identifying the situational
  and time-critical evolving characteristics of an emergency across information
  streams is under-researched. This Challenge seeks to focus research on
  analyzing a plethora of fast-moving data streams for
  life/infrastructure-critical situational information to support both effective
  and efficient response.


  Public safety organizations are inundated with live streaming data from a
  variety of sources. This live streaming data generally falls into two
  categories - some of this data is structured, while much of it is
  unstructured. Structured data that resides in a fixed field within a record or
  file (the kind typically found in spreadsheets or relational databases) is
  formatted in a way so that it can be readily queried. By contrast,
  unstructured data (e.g., video and audio) generally does not have a
  pre-*defined data* model or is not organized in a pre-*defined* manner and,
  therefore, is not readily searchable. The lack of a defined data model
  prevents the data from being automatically interpreted and used by automated
  decision support applications without significant human intervention.


  In this first contest, NIST PSCR is inviting a novel multidisciplinary
  community to share its vision for how to analyze numerous live data streams,
  understand the data, and transform it into information to support public
  safety decisions. We are looking for ideas that address the following analytic
  tasks as well as an overall extraction to analysis systems platform approach
  to the contest elements. The core analytic tasks for this contest can be
  broadly described as:


  1. **Information extraction across data streams and data sources:** Structured
  information is continuously extracted from each of the data streams that are
  necessary to support downstream analysis and detection of emergency events.

  2. **Information fusion across extracted data and generation of live/dynamic
  information representation:** Joint inferencing is performed across all of the
  information in the extracted streams to create an event-level analysis of an
  emergency and store that information in a dynamically evolving structured data
  representation that can be utilized at any time during the life of an
  emergency.

  3. **Automated emergency event analysis:**Highly actionable analytic reports
  about emergency events are generated from the extracted/fused structured
  information (as described in the above topics) into a form that can be readily
  rendered into actionable user-readable reports in real-time and in both
  ongoing and summary forms.


  Success in this ideation contest is dependent upon a clear vision of the
  components, platform, and novel approaches that fulfill the functions of
  real-time information extraction, live dynamic information fusion and
  representation, and evolving emergency event analysis.

  components of the system**. Later contests will expand the focus to include
  the end user interfaces to the analytic information.
