description: >-
  Manufacturing is important for America&rsquo;s prosperity. It is estimated
  that for every dollar spent in U.S. manufacturing, another $1.89 is added to
  the economy; the highest multiplier effect of any economic sector.
  Manufacturing accounts for millions of jobs and about 12% of the
  nation&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product. With all that economic activity, the
  industrial sector accounted for about one-third of total U.S. energy
  consumption in 20173. Making smart energy investments will enhance our
  nation&rsquo;s security, productivity, and energy independence. For
  manufacturers, every dollar saved allows for investment in production,
  facilities, and jobs that ultimately makes U.S. companies more competitive and
  resilient. Improving the energy performance of manufacturing facilities has a
  broad impact; savings from reduced operating expenses can be reinvested in
  technology upgrades and new jobs.
