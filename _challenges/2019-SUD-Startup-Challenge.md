### Description
Challenge Summary:
The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), one of the components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), announces the 4th annual "$100,000 for Start a SUD Startup" Challenge. The Challenge goal is to support research ideas that would further an understanding of Substance Use Disorders (SUD) and that are intended to be the foundation for the development of successful new startups. NIDA expects that the contest will enable participants to test the premise that their research idea can be fostered into a biotech startup, and that eventually the newly created startups will contribute to the pool of innovative small business companies that can successfully compete for NIDA's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding. The Challenge will offer up to ten awards of $10,000 each and technical expertise and mentoring from NIDA scientific research entrepreneurship experts. The Challenge total purse is up to $100,000.

Challenge Description:
NIDA is reissuing this Challenge after confirming its dependable success and popularity within the community in 2016, 2017 and 2018. The Challenge is a competition for participants with research ideas that would further an understanding of SUD and that are intended to be the foundation for the development of new successful startups. NIDA offers $100,000 together with the technical expertise and mentoring from scientific research entrepreneurship experts and expects that the contest will enable participants to test the premise that their research idea can be fostered into a biotech startup. This Challenge is unique because NIDA intends to provide the prize money and scientific research-based entrepreneurial assistance to the &ldquo;would be&rdquo; startup founders much earlier than most investors, incubators, or traditional models of research funding (e.g. small business grants). However, NIDA anticipates that, eventually, the newly created startups will contribute to the pool of innovative small business companies that can successfully compete for NIDA&rsquo;s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding.

What does it take to participate in the Challenge? The participants must have a research idea directly related to SUD or that could be extended or adjusted to be useful for SUD. For a platform technology, the research idea must be broad enough to address multiple conditions, diseases, or indications, including SUD. For example, if the idea can only work for cancer or diabetes, entering this Challenge is not appropriate. However, if the plan is to test an idea for a research tool that would further an understanding of neurobiology or epigenetics relevant to SUD to advance the field faster and with greater fidelity, entering this Challenge is appropriate. The participants must also be interested in creating the startup around their research idea. The research &ldquo;idea&rdquo; is the product that the future startup will offer. Here, the term startup &ldquo;product&rdquo; is used in its broadest definition. Product is any source of value for the people who become customers. Services, subscriptions, software as a service (SaaS), physical/tangible products (biomedical devices, drugs, etc.), aggregations, etc. could all provide value and thus be considered startup products. The startup product could be the result of novel scientific discoveries, repurposing an existing technology for a new use, extending a research observation or discovery made in a different scientific area into SUD, devising a new business model or distribution/delivery channel that unlocks new value, or simply bringing a product or service to an underserved customer.

The potential startup founder must also have the passion, drive, discipline, ability to work collaboratively and willingness to push forward under conditions of extreme business uncertainty.&nbsp;

The winners of this Challenge are encouraged and offered training to use the prize money to develop a minimum viable product (MVP), to obtain customer feedback to discover if the MVP meets the customer needs, and to assess the feasibility of science-based small business creation, within 6 months post-award. Post Challenge, as with all other NIH grant applicants, NIDA staff will provide dedicated assistance and guidance about the grant submission process, including how to submit an SBIR/STTR application to NIDA&rsquo;s small business programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Judging Criteria

Judging Criteria

The judging panel will make recommendations to the award approving official based upon the following 5 criteria. Each criterion will be scored with the maximum of 10 points.&nbsp;
            


Significance and Unmet Needs


Are there significant needs for the proposed product or service? Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field of SUD/drug abuse research? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, service or clinical practice be improved? How those improvements will be measured or established? Is there an evidence of market research? (0-10 points)



Innovation


Does the proposed idea utilize the novel theoretical concepts, approaches, methodologies, instrumentation, service or interventions for SUD/drug abuse research? Is proposed product novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies instrumentation or interventions proposed? (0-10 points)



Approach


Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to test the proposed idea? Does the approach take the feedback from the end-users or end-user need assessment into account? (0-10 points)



Team/Founder Attributes


Does the individual or team demonstrate high level of ability and dedication? Were the passion, drive, discipline, ability to work collaboratively and willingness to push forward under conditions of extreme business uncertainty successfully demonstrated? (0-10 points)



Commercialization


Is there a clear path for the product/service to reach the market? Are the product users and purchasers clearly identified? Is there an evidence of market research or analysis of competitors? (0-10 points)



Basis Upon Which Winner Will Be Selected


Submissions that are responsive and comply with the entry requirements will be reviewed by a panel of judges consisting of Federal employees. The responsive and compliant submission entries will be scored in accordance with the judging criteria outlined above. Scores from each criterion will be weighted equally, but failure to meet a minimum standard for any one criterion might disqualify a submission. The score for each submission will be the sum of the scores from each of the voting judges. The scores will be listed in order, from highest to lowest. Participants with sufficiently high scores will then be contacted for &ldquo;live&rdquo; meetings via the tele- or video-conference. Those meetings will be used to gather more details about the information provided in the Submission Package and to determine the up-to-date level of participant availability, interest and commitment. Final prize recommendations will be determined based on the judges&rsquo; scoring and tele- or video-conference meetings.
