### Description
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg}

<div class="description">
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy Water Power Technologies Office invites you to submit your ideas to develop wave powered desalination systems for the Waves to Water Prize. The Waves to Water Prize is a 4-Stage, $2.5M contest to accelerate the development of small, modular, wave-powered desalination systems capable of providing potable drinking water in disaster relief scenarios and remote coastal locations.</p>
<p>The prize supports the integration of existing and novel wave energy generation technologies with water technologies that can deliver effective, consistent, durable and low-maintenance water delivery systems. The prize seeks to identify the ideal scale of wave energy innovation paired with water technologies that can serve niche markets such as disaster response, and advance the state of both wave energy devices and desalination technologies that could provide value in other markets as the technologies mature.</p>
<ul><li>Stage I: CONCEPT June 13, 2019 to September 11, 2019</li>
<li>Stage II: DESIGN 90 DAYS: October 2019 to January 2020 (anticipated)</li> 
<li>Stage III: CREATE 180 DAYS: February 2020 to August 2020 (anticipated)</li>
<li>Stage IV: DRINK 180 DAYS: October 2020 to April 2021 (anticipated)</li>
