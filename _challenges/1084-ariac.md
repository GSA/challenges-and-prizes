<!-- Description start -->
### Description
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg .challenge-section}

<p>The Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation Competition, ARIAC, addresses a critical limitation of robots used in industrial environments like factory floors: they are not as agile as they need to be. Many robots are not able to quickly detect failures, or recover from those failures. They aren't able to sense changes in their environment and modify their actions accordingly. Programming these robots for even the simplest tasks takes time and effort. Help solve this problem by coding your own robot control system (software) that can outperform everyone else's in a simulated environment! Compete to win up to $17,500 in cash prizes and the opportunity to showcase your solution at a future robotics conference. Timeline for Competition is expected to be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registration Open : Now Through April 2020</li>
<li>Competition Qualifier: April 6-10, 2020</li>
<li>Competition Finals: May 11-15, 2020</li>
</ul>
