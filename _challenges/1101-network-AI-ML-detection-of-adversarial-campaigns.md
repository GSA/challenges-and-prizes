### Description
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg .challenge-section}

<p>The Naval Information Warfare Systems Command (NAVWARSYSCOM) and the Program Executive Office for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (PEO C4I) are conducting a second instance of the Artificial Intelligence Applications to Autonomous Cybersecurity (AI ATAC), pronounced &ldquo;AI attack&rdquo; Challenge (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;the Challenge&rdquo;). The Navy&rsquo;s Information Assurance and Cybersecurity Program Office (PMW 130) seeks to automate the Security Operations Center (SOC) using artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to detect advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign activity. There is a tremendous amount of untapped cybersecurity information at the network level that can improve situational awareness, provide context for network events, and reveal the presence of adversaries. PMW 130 solicits white papers describing network-based security technologies and the corresponding tool for evaluation in the AI ATAC Prize Challenge competition.</p>

<li>The recommended base configuration of the technology;</li>
<li>A description of the resources required to run the technology to support an up to 1,500 node network, if delivered as software or a VM;</li>
<li>A representative sample of output data with field descriptions.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>* the tool and white paper must contain only unclassified material</p>
<p>More details on each are provided below.</p>
<p>Please email <a href="mailto:AIATAC.PRIZE.CHALLENGE@NAVY.MIL">AIATAC.PRIZE.CHALLENGE@NAVY.MIL</a> to indicate your intent to submit prior to 29 MAY 2020.</p>
<p><strong>In order for an entry to be considered, the white paper, corresponding technology, and corresponding user&rsquo;s guide must be submitted no later than 29 MAY 2020, in accordance with these submission guidelines.</strong></p>
<p><strong>White Paper Submission Guidelines:</strong></p>
<p>It is suggested that participants use the white paper template when submitting their entry. It provides the framework for an overview of the proposed technology as well as the</p>
