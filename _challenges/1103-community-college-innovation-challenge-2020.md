### Description
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg .challenge-section}

The Community College Innovation Challenge (CCIC) is sponsored by the
National Science Foundation (NSF) and the American Association of Community
Colleges (AACC). It is a prestigious, two-phase competition where community
college student teams, working with a supportive faculty or administrator mentor,
use science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to innovate
solutions to real-world problems; earn full travel support to attend an Innovation
Boot Camp in the Washington, DC, metro area; and compete for cash awards.
The Innovation Boot Camp provides professional development, mentoring, and
coaching designed to build strategic communication and entrepreneurial skills to
help students advance their innovations in both the private and public sectors.
Students participate in sessions on commercializing ideas, using technology for
social applications, communicating with stakeholders, refining a pitch, and more.
The CCIC includes a poster session and reception on Capitol Hill and a formal
presentation at the Boot Camp in front of a panel of esteemed industry
professionals to determine the first and second place winning teams.
