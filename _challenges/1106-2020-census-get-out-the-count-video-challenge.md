### Description
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg .challenge-section}

<h2><strong>Background &amp; Context </strong></h2>
<p><strong><u>The 2020 Census</u></strong></p>
<p>The 2020 Decennial Census is a constitutionally mandated once-a-decade count of our nation. <strong>It is critical that we achieve a complete and accurate count of everyone in the United States because the results determine how many representatives in Congress each state has &mdash; and how almost 700 billion federal dollars are distributed each year into communities for the next decade.</strong> Each person counted in the 2020 Census translates to <strong>more money for critical services like schools, hospitals, roads, fire departments, and many others. </strong>For further information and talking points about the importance of the 2020 Census, please refer to the <u><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dtbYtDk0rQIk6BliGi5szYkvRTAP1XVB_O6VTCJo2Mg/edit">2020 Census Resources Guide</a></u>.</p>
<p>Many people don&rsquo;t know how important this brief survey is to their community and day-to-day lives, and without further explanation or motivation, may not complete it at all. To solve this problem and help promote a complete and accurate count of the population, communities, government, creators, and experts have banded together to create engaging content that explains the importance, use, and safety of the census, and how to complete it.&nbsp; These efforts aim <strong>to make the 2020 Census a must-do for communities, particularly those considered &ldquo;hard-to-count,&rdquo; such as immigrants, people of color, and families with young children. </strong>As part of this grassroots outreach effort, it is critical that entertaining and/or humorous content be created in ways that will deeply resonate with a broad audience, with a particular hard-to-count group, or both.</p>
<p><strong><u>Census Accelerate </u></strong></p>
<p>This prize challenge is a component of the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s innovation program called <u><a href="http://accelerate.census.gov">Census Accelerate</a></u>. <strong>&nbsp;Census Accelerate</strong> brings together creative professionals, national advocacy organizations, and local leaders to develop community-driven content about the importance of the 2020 Census.</p>
<p>Its purpose is twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li>to amplify trusted voices in hard-to-count communities so that the messages resonate at a deep level, and</li>
<li>to fill content voids that can be exploited with disinformation intended to suppress 2020 census response rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Census Accelerate is launching this prize competition to reward 2020 Census-related videos with the highest visibility (or viral potential) and the highest impact (i.e., ability to move people to respond to the census). The challenge focuses on <strong>short-format video content </strong>&mdash; a medium that is relatively lacking in quantity and quality on user-generated platforms such as YouTube. The Census Bureau is conducting this challenge under the authority of and in accordance with the America COMPETES Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. &sect; 3719.</p>
<h2><strong>The challenge: guidance on video content and format&nbsp; </strong></h2>
<p><strong>Explain why the census matters in a short (30 seconds to 3 minutes) video, designed for a platform such as YouTube, that uses entertainment, emotion, creativity, and/or humor to motivate people to respond. </strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The following are video requirements that must be met for videos to be considered eligible for this competition. Videos <u>must</u>: </strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Target at least one hard to count population, </strong>such as (but not limited to): people of color, non-native English speakers, millennials/gen Z, families with young children, (please see page 2 of the <u><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dtbYtDk0rQIk6BliGi5szYkvRTAP1XVB_O6VTCJo2Mg/edit">Resource Guide</a></u> for a comprehensive list).</li>

<li>Be digital and available online via a web link. Ideally, videos should be designed for or available on platforms such as YouTube.</li>
<li><strong>Contain only accurate and factual content about the census.</strong> A <u><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dtbYtDk0rQIk6BliGi5szYkvRTAP1XVB_O6VTCJo2Mg/edit">resource guide</a></u> is available as content guidance. Questions or clarifications on census facts may be directed to <u><a href="mailto:census.accelerate@census.gov">accelerate@census.gov</a></u>; clarifying questions are encouraged and will not impact eligibility or chances of winning a prize<em>.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Video messaging guidance</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All videos <em>are strongly encouraged to</em>:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contain a balance of emotional storytelling and clear, relevant, motivating information. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Speak to the tangible benefits of the census</strong>. For example, the census means funding for your community for critical services like hospitals, health care, education, roads, <u><a href="https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/361">SNAP</a></u>, and more. (See the <u><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dtbYtDk0rQIk6BliGi5szYkvRTAP1XVB_O6VTCJo2Mg/edit">&ldquo;key facts</a></u>&rdquo; section of the Resource Guide to learn more about the benefits.) It also determines how many representatives your state will have in the House of Representatives; these are the people who will vote on issues that deeply impact your life and community.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on multiple benefits of completing the census </strong>where format allows.</li>
<li><strong>Weave direct messaging into realistic, authentic situations that avoid stereotyping</strong> in order to clearly communicate the importance and relevance of census participation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>General messaging guidance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Messaging that links 2020 Census participation to a better future for kids is broadly motivating.</li>
<li>In messaging research, &ldquo;funding for your community&rdquo; tested more strongly than &ldquo;political representation&rdquo; as a motivating factor.</li>
<li>Participants enjoy wit and tasteful humor, upbeat tempo, and inclusive imagery.</li>
<li>It is important to convey the message that the census is safe.</li>
<li>Consider the metaphor of &ldquo;disappearing&rdquo; &mdash; leaving valuable benefits on the table for you and your community, and communicating that the census impacts the next 10 years of your life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Additional messaging guidance for specific audiences:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Consider using languages other than English (there are <u><a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/planning-management/language-resources/language-guides.html">59 language guides available</a></u>; the census itself is available in 13 languages).</li>
<li>In messaging research, young people connected with diversity and inclusion and demonstrated a deep understanding of the key messages and effects of the census.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Consider the timing of this challenge, which will conclude in the &ldquo;reminder phase&rdquo;: </strong>When winners of this challenge are announced<strong> in May</strong>, the national census advertising campaign will be in the &ldquo;reminder&rdquo; phase.
<ul>
<li>The key message during this phase is that although the census will have kicked off in March, <strong>it&rsquo;s not too late to respond.</strong></li>
<li>During the reminder phase, census-takers (officially called &ldquo;enumerators&rdquo;) will start going door-to-door to collect responses. Yet, for many people, a knock on the door by a government official may not be welcome.<strong> Message testing shows that people may be motivated to respond online knowing that it will make it less likely for a census worker to come to their door. </strong></li>
<li>Effective messages specific to the reminder phase include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Convey urgency</strong>: it is important to fill out the census right away.</li>
<li>You can still respond online today before you get a knock on the door.</li>
<li>If you do get a knock on the door by an official census worker (who can verify their identity), answer it. <strong>Enumerators are friendly people, often from your own neighborhood, and it helps to humanize them.</strong> They are working to better the community for everyone (i.e. they are not &ldquo;coming to get you and your information&rdquo;).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Guidance for Video Tags and Titles </u></strong></p>
<p>Appropriately tagging and titling videos can make them more visible and discoverable, and help mitigate other content that is problematic or misinformed.&nbsp; Some suggested titles and/or tags, used by the U.S. Census Bureau and Census Partners, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>#2020Census</li>
<li>Count Me In / #countmein</li>
<li>Count Us In / #countusin</li>
<li>I Count / #icount</li>
<li>We Count / #wecount</li>
