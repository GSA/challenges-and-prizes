### Description
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg .challenge-section}

<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is looking for innovative, effective, and replicable approaches to building a diverse and inclusive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce through partnerships. As an NSF initiative with a mission to enhance U.S. leadership in STEM by facilitating partnerships, NSF INCLUDES is sponsoring to the NSF STEM DIVE Challenge.</p>
<p>NSF invites grantees from all NSF programs to showcase, in the form of a short video (1 to 3 minutes), how forging partnerships, networks, or alliances has contributed to an increase in diversity and inclusion in STEM. All entries must be submitted by a Principal Investigator (PI) or Co-PI on any previous or current funded NSF award. These videos will be used by NSF and its programs in various platforms (e.g. websites, fair exhibitions, printed materials) to exhibit how grantees have encouraged and supported diversity and inclusion in STEM preK-12, higher, and informal education. This challenge is also designed to attract more broader interest in STEM and to inform the greater community on best practices for increasing diversity and inclusion, effective partnership and networking strategies, and dissemination approaches for growing the STEM workforce.</p>
<p>Entrants must be a PI or Co-PI of a current or expired National Science Foundation (NSF) grant or cooperative agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>May be an individual or a team of up to four people.</li>
<li>Must be a U.S. citizens or permanent residents, or legal residents in the U.S. by June 24, 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Employment requirements can be located at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/ehr/stemdive.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>www.nsf.gov/ehr/stemdive.jsp</u></a></p>
<p>Cash prizes will be issued to the registered team leader. It is the team and team leader&rsquo;s responsibility to determine whether and how prizes will be shared among team members and to implement such sharing arrangements.</p>
<p>In addition to cash prizes, winning videos will be posted on NSF&rsquo;s Education Human Resources Directorate web page and the NSF INCLUDES National Network on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.includesnetwork.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.includesnetwork.org&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585051119444000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHJdkeEqmEJtLgCUDgoMicEWSIl3A">https://www.includesnetwork.<wbr />org</a>. &nbsp;Should NSF decide to bring winning entrants to Washington, D.C., or to any other location for promotional and other purposes, expenses paid by NSF for entrants&rsquo; travel will be within the limits set forth in law according to federal travel regulations.</p>
<p>Videos will be judged on approach, impact and sustainability; visual appeal; effective communication; and originality.</p>
<p><strong>Key dates: </strong>The Challenge begins on March 24, 2020. All video entries must be uploaded to YouTube and written entries submitted by 11:00 p.m. ET on June 25, 2020.</p>

### Judging Criteria
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg .challenge-section}

<p>Judges will be a panel of STEM researchers, educators, and other professionals at NSF, the NSF awardee community, and the broader public. &nbsp;They will evaluate, score, and rank submissions to determine winner(s) in the Informal STEM Education, PreK-12 STEM Education, STEM Higher Education, and STEM Alliances entry categories. &nbsp;Entries will be evaluated based on: Approach, Impact, and Sustainability; Visual Appeal; Effective Communication; and Originality. NSF will make final determinations and award all prize winners.</p>
<p>The judging panel will use a 100-point scale to evaluate the videos. The scale will rank the extent to which the video can demonstrate the following:</p>
<p><strong><u>Approach, Impact and Sustainability (40pts)</u></strong></p>
<p>A successful entry must display an executed concept that has encouraged and supported diversifying and developing a competent U.S. STEM workforce of scientists, technicians, engineers, mathematicians and educators through partnerships.&nbsp; A successful entry should clearly define the approach taken to the work. Impact can be measured in the number of people reached, policies developed, programs created, and partnerships forged.&nbsp; In the case of social media, the following numbers should be indicated: views, readers, citations, subscribers, retweets or shares, and public responses. An entry should demonstrate how the effort(s) could or have been sustained within your organization and disseminated to the wider STEM community.</p>
<p><strong><u>Visual Appeal (15pts)</u></strong></p>
<p>A successful entry provides viewers with a visually striking, unique, clean, and creative technical approach to video production. The video must have a high level of audibility and visual quality.&nbsp; The entry must be polished and professional and must be executed with factual accuracy.</p>
<p><strong><u>Effective Communication (25pts)</u></strong></p>
<p>A successful entry communicates in a clear and understandable manner. It uses plain language, both written and spoken. The written entry description and caption must be presented at a level and using language that can be understood by the general public, which includes a broad audience of varying ages and backgrounds. Use of technical terminology and assumption of prior knowledge of STEM concepts in the video should be limited.</p>
<p><strong><u>Originality (20pts)</u></strong></p>
<p>A successful entry creates a novel presentation or tells a compelling story and portrays new insight and approaches to broadening diversity in STEM.</p>
