### Description

With the maturation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, specialized architectures and processors for AI applications, cloud computing, high-speed communications networks and streaming data resources and protocols, it is now possible to create automated tools to assist public safety organizations in analyzing the increasingly large amounts of information at their fingertips to help them make the most informed decisions based on a comprehensive analysis of the data available. Such tools will help distill, structure, and present the quickly evolving information from a multitude of data streams to public safety organizations in a way that supports time-critical decision making and serves as an essential force multiplier.

Due to the multitude of sensors and devices being used in public safety along with communications data collected in operations and contributed by the public, and the multi-modal nature of all of these data streams, transforming data, especially unstructured data, into information in real-time is one of the key technology gaps that must be bridged to achieve advances in this area. The available technology is insufficient to bridge this technological gap because:

* Most automated data analysis tools have been developed for use with archival data and focus on post-event forensic analysis.
* Few analytic technologies focus on a moving representation of live streaming data that is updated over time, and that can be used to show temporal changes in the analysis.
* Tools that make data available to first responders in real-time are heavily weighted towards a visual representation of responder location and structured reporting of known emergency communications.
* Few public safety emergency analysis tools exist that provide an effective real-time automated analysis and fusion of information from unstructured public safety communications streams and sensor- and citizen-generated data streams.

### Prizes

A total prize purse of up to**$150,000**will be awarded to the winners, as follows:

Topic 1: Information extraction across ASAPS streams and data sources across 1 or more data categories:**$30,000**

Topic 2: Information fusion across extracted data and generation of live/dynamic information representation, across 3 or more data categories:**$30,000**

Topic 3: Automated emergency event analysis across 3 or more data stream categories, and preferably across all data categories:**$30,000**

Topic 4: Extraction-to-analysis systems approach across all data categories:**2 X $30,000**
