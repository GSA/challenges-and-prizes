### Description
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg}

The Federal government would benefit from better access to a well-integrated set of partners representing diverse industries and sectors to help resolve our toughest management problems. How can the government improve collaboration with leading private sector organizations, state and local governments, researchers, academic institutions, Federal government representatives, and the public? We cannot keep solving problems the same way and expect different results.

What is the GEAR Center?
As described in the Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century reform plan, A Government Effectiveness Advanced Research (GEAR) Center could bring together experts in disciplines ranging from economics, to computer science, to design thinking, in order to take a creative, data-driven, and interdisciplinary approach to new possibilities in how citizens and government interact. The GEAR Center can help government modernize to close the gap between government and private-sector services and capabilities. This may also lay the groundwork for where Federal operations and services need to be in five, 10, or 20 years.

What is the Challenge?
This competition challenges "Solvers" (participating individuals, teams or legal entities) to demonstrate the usefulness of a GEAR Center model by describing how this model would tackle one or more of the major challenges facing government described in the current President's Management Agenda (PMA). For example, how should the government approach the introduction of artificial intelligence into operations? How can agencies more efficiently create a clearing house for matching government needs to relevant project ideas and researchers? Are there new ways to better connect diverse expertise across geographies with Federal agencies who can put that expertise to work in support of their missions? How can Federal agencies better prepare and recruit the Federal workforce?

Before the government invests in a future GEAR Center, it is important to first explore the feasibility of creating these types of partnerships and if they can produce the kinds of quality approaches to problem solving the government needs. This competition is designed to reward the top models and execution strategies that will demonstrate a use case of a potential GEAR Center project by building on existing similar efforts.

As a first step in formulating the vision for the GEAR Center, in December 2018, the interagency GEAR Team shared the results of the Request for Information, in which over 40 entities submitted ideas for what a GEAR Center could be and how it might operate. Now, our goal is to recognize high-potential GEAR Center models by awarding prizes to those that can propose a workable GEAR Center model through a demonstration of how that model would creatively address one or more PMA-related challenges (pg. 4, 7-9).

What is the Prize?
GSA is offering up to three $300,000 cash prizes to the top solutions proposed, as well as selecting up to five additional winners for public recognition. We anticipate that each of the three cash awards will be for solutions that feasibly deliver results tackling different management challenges, but reserve the right to award up to three that propose solutions that address the same PMA-related challenge.

Solvers may propose GEAR Center solutions that would: 

Transform the way the Federal workforce is recruited, developed, reskilled or deployed.
Empower external users to access and use Government data for commercial and other public purposes.
Better connect Federal programs with a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the people they serve, and capture the voice of the customer in order to continuously improve Federal services.
Solvers can suggest their own ideas to address issues described in the President's Management Agenda.
On May 13, 2019 we hosted a webinar to answer questions and allow interested Solvers to connect with experts working on PMA challenges. The webinar was broadcast widely and is available online, along with answers to frequently asked questions: Webinar | Frequently Asked Questions

                          <p><strong>Challenge Summary</strong></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Improving Care for People with Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and Related Dementias Using Technology (iCare-AD/ADRD)&rdquo; Challenge is a Eureka prize competition in which the National Institute on Aging (NIA), part of the National Institutes of Health, rewards and spurs the development of solutions for a technology-based application, fostering connections between relevant stakeholders to use technology, or the development of new technology applications to improve dementia care coordination and/or care navigation. Though the solution should foster connections between relevant stakeholders to use technology or develop new technology applications, it may be targeted at consumers (persons with dementia (PWD), caregivers), healthcare providers, healthcare service organizations, and/or health systems, and/or community, local, or state governments. Specific methods for stimulating uptake and use of the product must be included with the working proof-of-concept demonstration. Please see the &ldquo;Submission Requirements and Template&rdquo; section for the necessary submission information.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge Description</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) announces the &ldquo;Improving Care for People with Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and Related Dementias Using Technology (iCare-AD/ADRD)&rdquo; Challenge. The goal of this challenge is to improve the quality of care for persons living with Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) by establishing proof-of-concept for the creation of a widely accessible and innovative technology tool(s) that addresses unmet needs in care coordination and/or care navigation through the health system. For the purpose of this challenge, &ldquo;related dementias&rdquo; will include frontotemporal dementia, Lewy Body dementia and vascular cognitive impairment/dementia.</p>
<p>This challenge is intended to stimulate innovation in use of technology to improve care coordination and/or navigation and/or aid with the care experience, so that overall dementia care quality is improved. This challenge invites solutions that involve the development of an IT system-level, computer, mobile, and/or other form of technology-based application.&nbsp; The solutions may involve creation of a new technology application, and/or modification or novel implementation of an existing technology. &nbsp;The solutions may be targeted at consumers (persons with dementia or caregivers), healthcare providers, healthcare service organizations, and/or health systems, and/or community, local, or state government. Specific methods for stimulating uptake and use of the solutions must be included with the proof-of-concept demonstrations.</p>
<p>A working demonstration of the product is required. Specific target markets or characteristics of end users must be identified.</p>
<p>The Challenge is expected to foster connections between relevant stakeholders to use technology to improve dementia care coordination and/or care navigation. &nbsp;Collaboration with and connections between relevant healthcare stakeholders are encouraged. Collaboration across organizations, for example, physician practices, nursing homes, assisted-living facilities and smart technology vendors, is also encouraged. Examples of possible solvers include small businesses, individuals -- including but not limited to people living with dementia and caregivers -- midsize to large technology companies, health insurance companies, electronic health record (EHR) vendors, students working collaboratively across multiple disciplines, health systems, states, and/or counties implementing care coordination programs.</p>
<p>Examples that would fulfill the purpose of the Challenge include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aiding effective communication between clinicians and patients and families</span></em>: Solvers could develop a mobile application to assist persons with dementia (PWD) and caregivers at primary care and specialty physician visits. The application could be tailored to individual care needs, prepopulated with diagnoses and medications used, and include prompts for questions to ask clinicians or links to local resources and/or relevant insurance coverage information.</li>
<li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aiding care access and access to relevant community resources and/or enhancing user-friendliness of existing service access interfaces</span></em>: Solvers could use technology to assist PWD with aging in place, improve access to appropriate transportation options using smart devices, and coordinate health care visits.</li>
<li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Improving care coordination</span></em>: A collaboration between a technology company, EHR vendor, and nursing home chain could yield EHR-based methods to improve care coordination. Care coordination solutions may also involve behavioral &ldquo;nudges&rdquo; for care providers and/or care recipients using smart technology and may be designed for direct use by PWD and caregivers.</li>
