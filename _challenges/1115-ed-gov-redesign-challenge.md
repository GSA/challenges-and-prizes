description: "To improve service to and communication with stakeholders and the general public, the Department of Education (“ED” or “Department”) plans to modernize its public facing website.  Accordingly, ED is seeking small-scale prototypes for a redesign of ED.gov, the Department’s homepage.  \n\nThe Department is not seeking a run-of-the-mill refresh but rather a creative redesign that maximizes user experience and proposes new innovations in layout, typography, animation, illustration, video and photography, and other modern advances.\n\n*About the Department of Education*\n\nED is the agency of the federal government that establishes policy for, administers, and coordinates most federal assistance to education. The Department assists the president in executing his education policies for the nation and in implementing laws enacted by Congress. ED's mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.\n\nAlthough ED is a relative newcomer among Cabinet-level agencies, its origins go back to 1867, when President Andrew Johnson signed legislation creating the first Department of Education. Its main purpose was to collect information and statistics about the nation's schools. However, due to concern that ED would exercise too much control over local schools, the new Department was demoted to an Office of Education in 1868.\n\nOver the years, the office remained relatively small, operating under different titles and housed in various agencies, including the U.S. Department of the Interior and the former U.S. Department of Health Education and Welfare (now Health and Human Services).\n\n*The Current State of ED.gov*\n\nTo achieve its goals and further its mission, ED maintains open communication with the general public, especially those seeking information on behalf of their states, districts, schools, and children. That’s why the organization must keep pace with the way 21st century Americans learn, engage, and interact. With 312 million internet users in the United States alone – and 90 percent of American adults reporting using the internet “at least occasionally”  – it is essential to maintain a strong web presence. A key component of that effort is redesigning ED’s website.\n\nED.gov is the Department’s main public-facing website, with nearly 15 million users accessing the site in 2019. These users represented:  students and parents; press; educators and administrators; state and local officials; non-profit stakeholders; representatives from community organizations; and advocates, among others. The site’s most-visited pages included information about student loan and grant programs, and laws – like the Freedom of Information Act and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.\n\nThe Department’s web presence includes several subdomains: www.ED.gov, www2.ed.gov, blog.ed.gov, and sites.ed.gov. ED.gov is managed with the open-source Drupal, WordPress and TeamSite content management systems (CMS) and is hosted externally in a cloud environment.\n\n*Limitations and Challenges of Current Design*\n\nNearly 40 percent of people will stop engaging with a website if the design is unattractive, , and nearly half of users cite design as the number one factor in assessing credibility. . Design plays a critical role in ensuring the public has access to, and engages with, the content on ED.gov.\n\nThe last large-scale update of ED.gov occurred in 2015. At that time, ED analyzed available data to determine what pages most users were accessing and redesigned the homepage to fit the public’s evolving needs. This redesign reduced the number of homepage links and created more open space, so the page became more easily navigable to the end user. The update also meant that the entire flagship site offered a mobile-friendly experience, with all content layouts using responsive design. \n\nWhile the update included several important changes, the design fell short in key areas. Customers find it challenging to quickly locate information that meets their needs. The current site: \n\n* Remains difficult to navigate;\n* Does not incorporate the latest functionality that enhances the user experience;\n* Relies too heavily on text;\n* Is antiquated; and\n* Does not have a consistent brand, look, or feel.\n\n*Goals for a Redesigned ED.gov*\n\nThe goal for this Challenge is to improve the overall quality of the design, navigation, interactivity, and presentation of ED.gov.  \n\n**The challenge is for design prototypes only.** The design prototypes received will be used to inform the development of requirements for a future acquisition for the rebuild of ED.gov. This challenge is not intended to lead to a follow-on acquisition but rather is a form of market research. Still, applicants are allowed to compete for the implementation contract following the prototype submission, even if their submission was not chosen for the redesign challenge. The two processes are independent of each other (see more details below).  \n\nED’s website is a content and information hub. Redesign innovators should focus on that foundation.  In the improved design, ED.gov should have: \n\n* Accessible content for desktop, mobile, and tablet users;\n* Integrated social media, RSS feeds, and subscription services;\n* Elegant, clean, simple, user-centered look and feel with a modern aesthetic;\n* Strong ED branding on the homepage, and throughout the entire site with a consistent appearance;\n* New and innovative tools that enhance user experience; and\n* Engaging and easy-to-navigate pages.\n\n*Performance Objectives* \n\nThe redesign of ED.gov should engage the American public, amplify the Secretary’s message, and advance ED’s policy goals, while maintaining high availability and high performance.  \n\nInnovators should ensure to the greatest extent practicable that any design supports the federally mandated 21st Century Idea Act for modernization, including complying with the following: \n\n* Be accessible to individuals with disabilities by applying section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n* Uses the US Web Design Standards maturity model to create and implement the site.\n* Have a consistent appearance.\n* Contain a search function intended for public use.\n* Be provided through an industry-standard, secure connection.\n* Be fully functional and usable on common mobile devices.\n\n*Key Parameters* \n\nIn redesigning ED.gov, Challenge participants should focus on six (6) key templates: \n\n1. Homepage (http://www.ed.gov);\n2. Program office page (e.g. https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/om/fs_po/ocr/home.html?src=oc)\n3. Informational page (e.g. https://www2.ed.gov/fund/grants-college.html?src=pn);\n4. Grant page (e.g. https://www2.ed.gov/programs/fws/index.html);\n5. Contact page (https://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/gen/index.html?src=ft); and\n6. News page (http://www.ed.gov/news). The prototype must also comply with the following directives: •\tNew designs should conform with ED’s existing color scheme and use its current seal.  •\tNew designs must not use proprietary software or operating systems unless necessary. \n   •\tThe site should use either the Drupal and/or WordPress open-source CMS for web or content creation and for managing information or content on a webpage.\n\nPrototypes may incorporate text and content already available on the website, or dummy text.\n\nDeliverables\n\nTo meet the need of this challenge, participants should provide a link to a fully-functional prototype of an ED.gov redesign for the above six pages.  In addition, participants should provide back-up documentation for the prototype that includes: •\tWireframes that present the site layout and navigation. •\tMock-ups that include the layout and navigation from the wireframes but with brand and site colors, logo, images, content blocks, typography, etc. •\tOther information such as open-source CMS used, development language(s), browser(s) supported, mobile compatibility, screen resolutions (including responsive for mobile), operating systems, assistive technologies, text sizing, etc."
