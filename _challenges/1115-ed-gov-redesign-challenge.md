  To improve service to and communication with stakeholders and the general
  public, the Department of Education (“ED” or “Department”) plans to modernize
  its public facing website.  Accordingly, ED is seeking small-scale prototypes
  for a redesign of ED.gov, the Department’s homepage.  


  The Department is not seeking a run-of-the-mill refresh but rather a creative
  redesign that maximizes user experience and proposes new innovations in
  layout, typography, animation, illustration, video and photography, and other
  modern advances.


  *About the Department of Education*


  ED is the agency of the federal government that establishes policy for,
  administers, and coordinates most federal assistance to education. The
  Department assists the president in executing his education policies for the
  nation and in implementing laws enacted by Congress. ED's mission is to
  promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by
  fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.


  Although ED is a relative newcomer among Cabinet-level agencies, its origins
  go back to 1867, when President Andrew Johnson signed legislation creating the
  first Department of Education. Its main purpose was to collect information and
  statistics about the nation's schools. However, due to concern that ED would
  exercise too much control over local schools, the new Department was demoted
  to an Office of Education in 1868.


  Over the years, the office remained relatively small, operating under
  different titles and housed in various agencies, including the U.S. Department
  of the Interior and the former U.S. Department of Health Education and Welfare
  (now Health and Human Services).


  *The Current State of ED.gov*


  To achieve its goals and further its mission, ED maintains open communication
  with the general public, especially those seeking information on behalf of
  their states, districts, schools, and children. That’s why the organization
  must keep pace with the way 21st century Americans learn, engage, and
  interact. With 312 million internet users in the United States alone – and 90
  percent of American adults reporting using the internet “[at least
  occasionally](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276445/number-of-internet-users-in-the-united-states/)” 
  – it is essential to maintain a strong web presence. A key component of that
  effort is redesigning ED’s website.


  ED.gov is the Department’s main public-facing website, with nearly 15 million
  users accessing the site in 2019. These users represented:  students and
  parents; press; educators and administrators; state and local officials;
  non-profit stakeholders; representatives from community organizations; and
  advocates, among others. The site’s most-visited pages included information
  about student loan and grant programs, and laws – like the Freedom of
  Information Act and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.


  The Department’s web presence includes several subdomains: www.ED.gov,
  www2.ed.gov, blog.ed.gov, and sites.ed.gov. ED.gov is managed with the
  open-source Drupal, WordPress and TeamSite content management systems (CMS)
  and is hosted externally in a cloud environment.


  *Limitations and Challenges of Current Design*


  Nearly 40 percent of people will stop engaging with a website if the design is
  [unattractive](https://blogs.adobe.com/creative/files/2015/12/Adobe-State-of-Content-Report.pdf),
  and nearly half of users cite design as the number one factor in assessing
  [credibility](https://www.bluecorona.com/blog/20-web-design-facts-small-business-owners/).
  Design plays a critical role in ensuring the public has access to, and engages
  with, the content on ED.gov.


  The last large-scale update of ED.gov occurred in 2015. At that time, ED
  analyzed available data to determine what pages most users were accessing and
  redesigned the homepage to fit the public’s evolving needs. This redesign
  reduced the number of homepage links and created more open space, so the page
  became more easily navigable to the end user. The update also meant that the
  entire flagship site offered a mobile-friendly experience, with all content
  layouts using responsive design. 


  While the update included several important changes, the design fell short in
  key areas. Customers find it challenging to quickly locate information that
  meets their needs. The current site: 


  * Remains difficult to navigate;

  * Does not incorporate the latest functionality that enhances the user
  experience;

  * Relies too heavily on text;

  * Is antiquated; and

  * Does not have a consistent brand, look, or feel.


  *Goals for a Redesigned ED.gov*


  The goal for this Challenge is to improve the overall quality of the design,
  navigation, interactivity, and presentation of ED.gov.  


  **The challenge is for design prototypes only.** The design prototypes
  received will be used to inform the development of requirements for a future
  acquisition for the rebuild of ED.gov. This challenge is not intended to lead
  to a follow-on acquisition but rather is a form of market research. Still,
  applicants are allowed to compete for the implementation contract following
  the prototype submission, even if their submission was not chosen for the
  redesign challenge. The two processes are independent of each other (see more
  details below).  


  ED’s website is a content and information hub. Redesign innovators should
  focus on that foundation.  In the improved design, ED.gov should have: 


  * Accessible content for desktop, mobile, and tablet users;

  * Integrated social media, RSS feeds, and subscription services;

  * Elegant, clean, simple, user-centered look and feel with a modern aesthetic;

  * Strong ED branding on the homepage, and throughout the entire site with a
  consistent appearance;

  * New and innovative tools that enhance user experience; and

  * Engaging and easy-to-navigate pages.


  *Performance Objectives* 


  The redesign of ED.gov should engage the American public, amplify the
  Secretary’s message, and advance ED’s policy goals, while maintaining high
  availability and high performance.  


  Innovators should ensure to the greatest extent practicable that any design
  supports the federally mandated [21st Century Idea
  Act](https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ336/PLAW-115publ336.pdf) for
  modernization, including complying with the following: 


  * Be accessible to individuals with disabilities by applying section 508 of
  the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

  * Uses the [US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) maturity
  model to create and implement the site.

  * Have a consistent appearance.

  * Contain a search function intended for public use.

  * Be provided through an industry-standard, secure connection.

  * Be fully functional and usable on common mobile devices.


  *Key Parameters* 


  In redesigning ED.gov, Challenge participants should focus on six (6) key
  templates: 


  1. Homepage (<http://www.ed.gov>);

  2. Program office page
  (<https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/om/fs_po/ocr/home.html?src=oc>)

  3. Informational page (<https://www2.ed.gov/fund/grants-college.html?src=pn>);

  4. Grant page (<https://www2.ed.gov/programs/fws/index.html>);

  5. Contact page (<https://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/gen/index.html?src=ft>);
  and

  6. News page (<http://www.ed.gov/news>). 


  The prototype must also comply with the following directives:


  * New designs should conform with ED’s existing color scheme and use its
  current seal.

  * New designs must not use proprietary software or operating systems unless
  necessary. 

  * The site should use either the Drupal and/or WordPress open-source CMS for
  web or content creation and for managing information or content on a webpage.


  Prototypes may incorporate text and content already available on the website,
  or dummy text.


  *Deliverables*


  To meet the need of this challenge, participants should provide a link to a
  fully-functional prototype of an ED.gov redesign for the above six pages.  In
  addition, participants should provide back-up documentation for the prototype
  that includes:


  * Wireframes that present the site layout and navigation.

  * Mock-ups that include the layout and navigation from the wireframes but with
  brand and site colors, logo, images, content blocks, typography, etc.

  * Other information such as open-source CMS used, development language(s),
  browser(s) supported, mobile compatibility, screen resolutions (including
  responsive for mobile), operating systems, assistive technologies, text
  sizing, etc.
prizes: >-
  The Department of Education is offering a total prize pot of up to $50,000.
  The entirety of the prize may go to one winner or may be split between
  multiple winners, if the panel determines multiple winners are warranted. Up
  to three prize winners may be selected from the submissions, including a Grand
  Prize, a Runner Up, and an Honorable Mention.


  At the Department’s discretion, to assist with selecting winners, one or more
  of the most highly rated challenge participants may be invited to present a
  live demonstration of their ED.gov redesign prototype before agency subject
  matter experts, including Office of the Chief Information Officer staff,
  website owners, or segment owners. 


  Any potential prizes awarded under this Challenge will be paid by electronic
  funds transfer.  Winners will be required to complete and return an Automated
  Clearing House (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment Enrollment Form to ED within
  a given timeframe. The form collects banking information needed to make an
  electronic payment (direct deposit) to the winner. Award recipients will be
  responsible for any applicable local, state, and federal taxes and reporting
  that may be required under applicable tax laws.
