### Description
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg .challenge-section}

<p>The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA(ALT)) is announcing the fourth cohort of the Army Expeditionary Technology Search &ndash; <a href="https://www.arl.army.mil/xtechsearch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xTechSearch</a> &ndash; to be featured at the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Annual Meeting in Washington, DC from on 12 to 14 October 2020. xTechSearch will highlight opportunities for small businesses to collaborate with the Army to tackle the most critical Army modernization challenges.</p>
<p>The ASA(ALT) recognizes that the Army must enhance engagements with the small businesses, by: (1) understanding the spectrum of technologies being developed commercially that may benefit the Army; (2) integrating the sector of small business innovators into the Army&rsquo;s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) ecosystem; and (3) providing mentorship and expertise to accelerate, mature, and transition technologies of interest to the Army.</p>
<p>The Army xTechSearch program will provide non-dilutive seed prizes to select small businesses to demonstrate proof of concept of their dual-use technologies pertaining to Army challenges.&nbsp; The program will also drive to integrate these small businesses into the Army&rsquo;s S&amp;T ecosystem by providing research opportunities with Army labs, including authorized access to the Army&rsquo;s organic intellectual and technical capital.&nbsp; Participating companies will have access to training, mentorship and other support infrastructure as they progress through the contest. The goal will be to best align solutions with real users and buyers within the Army.&nbsp; xTechSearch is an opportunity for businesses to pitch novel technology solutions &ndash; a new application for an existing technology or a new technology concept entirely &ndash; to the Army.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The authority of this program is 15 United States Code (USC) &sect;3719.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The xTechSearch program is voluntary and open to all entities that meet the eligibility requirements.&nbsp; There may be only one submission per eligible entity.&nbsp; The registration information and upload submission must be received by 11:59 PM PST on 11 November 2019.&nbsp; Submissions received after the deadline will not be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Terms and Conditions: </strong>The entities allowed to participate in this competition must be sole proprietors or small business concerns in accordance with Small Business Administration guidance under 13 Code of Federal Regulations &sect; 121.201 or any entity willing and able to be registered as a small business if selected to participate in this competition.</p>
<p>Each eligible entity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shall be incorporated in, and maintain, a primary place of business in the United States;</li>
<li>May not be a Federal entity or employ a Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment</li>
</ul>
<p>Sole proprietors may participate in xTechSearch if the individual is a citizen or national of the United States or a lawful permanent resident of the United States and the business is registered in the United States.&nbsp; Foreign companies may participate in xTechSearch by establishing a US domestic business relationship (e.g., wholly owned US subsidiary) or partner with a US based company. Companies that have previously participated in the xTechSearch competition are eligible to participate for new technology concepts or improvements to prior submitted proposals.</p>
<p>All xTechSearch submissions are treated as privileged information and contents are disclosed to Government employees or designated support contractors only for the purpose of evaluation and program support.</p>
<p>Written feedback will be provided to all participants at the end of each phase.&nbsp; The purpose of providing this feedback is to provide insight on the Government&rsquo;s application of the scoring criteria.&nbsp; However, the Government will not respond to questions or inquiries regarding this feedback.</p>
<p>While the authority of this program is 15 USC &sect;3719, a concept white paper submitted to the xTechSearch program may generate interest by another Army organization for a funding opportunity outside of this program (e.g., submission of a proposal under a Broad Agency Announcement).&nbsp; The interested Army organization may contact the participant to provide additional information.</p>
