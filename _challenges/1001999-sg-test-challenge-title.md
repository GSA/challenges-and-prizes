  The[2020 Census](https://2020census.gov/) is a constitutionally mandated
  once-a-decade count of our nation.**It is critical that we achieve a complete
  and accurate count of [everyone living in the United
  States](https://2020census.gov/en/am-i-required.html) because the results
  determine how many representatives in Congress each state has â€” and how more
  than $675 billion federal dollars are distributed each year into communities
  for the next decade.**The 2020 Census results inform spending for **critical
  services like schools, hospitals, roads, fire departments, and much more.**For
  further information and talking points about the importance of the 2020
  Census, please refer to the *[2020 Census Resources
  Guide](https://www.challenge.gov/assets/document-library/2020-Census-Resource-Guide-GOTC-Video-Prize-Challenge.pdf)
