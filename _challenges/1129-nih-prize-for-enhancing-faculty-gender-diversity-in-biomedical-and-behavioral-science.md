  Though the proportions of women and men are similar at the graduate level for
  biomedical sciences and in medical schools, women are underrepresented at the
  faculty level in both science and medicine, particularly in the mid- to
  senior-level ranks ([National Science Foundation 2017 Doctorate Recipients
  from U.S. Universities](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/); and [2016 CBE
  Life Sci Educ. 15(3)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27587850/)). Diversity
  of thought and expertise have been recognized as attributes that drive
  innovation, complement dynamic research, and promote excellence. Supporting
  the sustained advancement of women in biomedical careers has the potential to
  enhance such diversity in the faculty ranks across scientific fields. Doing so
  will also promote more inclusive research and clinical environments which are
  critical to retaining and advancing women in biomedical careers.


  Understanding that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to enhancing diversity in academia and that ideas based on evidence are necessary to achieve systemic change, this prize competition will recognize institutions for approaches that have clearly succeeded in addressing faculty diversity and equity issues in biomedical and behavioral science departments, centers, or divisions. The aim is to acknowledge and recognize transformative structures, systems, projects, programs, and processes that were implemented to successfully enhance and sustain gender diversity within the institution. For example, success could have been accomplished through addressing barriers to career advancement, employing mentoring structures, adopting work-life integration and career flexibility programs, enhancing pathways to leadership, implementing specific recruitment efforts, changing workplace culture, or other approaches. This prize competition may build on the outcomes of previous initiatives, such as NIH’s Research on Causal Factors and Interventions that Promote and Support the Careers of Women in Biomedical and Behavioral Science and Engineering ([RFA-FM-09-012](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-gm-09-012.html)), the National Science Foundation [ADVANCE](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5383) program, or other programs and/or internal initiatives in support of interventions that improve the climate and career advancement for women faculty at academic institutions.


  Critical to this prize competition is the identification of best practices, the sharing of lessons learned, and the delineation of evidence-based approaches that can be broadly translated to, and replicated by, other institutions. These approaches may represent policies, evidence-based programs, tools, and/or activities, or a mixture thereof. Because this prize competition recognizes achievement through past intervention(s), such interventions must have been implemented prior to the launch date of this prize competition. The interventions must also have a demonstrated record as an effective model that can be adapted by other institutions and organizations. The past efforts and interventions should have addressed the full range of faculty career stages, from junior faculty to senior leadership, as well as potential sources of gender-based inequities, such as pay or allocation of resources. Applicants will need to demonstrate how their interventions have directly led to sustained systemic changes within the institution. Therefore, an in-depth assessment of institutional composition, policies, other relevant factors that were potential barriers to gender diversity and equity, and were subsequently mitigated through intervention(s), will need to be included in the submission. Submissions most likely to win the prize competition will have developed tools and/or interventions that can be employed to assist other institutions or academic groups with issues of inclusion and help to create environments that facilitate achievement. These efforts should be amenable to wide dissemination and implementation, as best practices for enhancing faculty gender diversity in biomedical and behavioral sciences.

  **Prize Breakdown**


  Up to 10 winning institutions will be awarded a prize of up to $50,000 each. The number of prizes issued to “low- or limited-resourced institutions” as defined below in the Eligibility Rules for Participating in the Prize Competition, will be determined by the judging committee, subject to a final decision by the Award Approving Official.


  **Non-monetary Prizes**


  Additional submissions may be recognized as honorable mentions with non-monetary awards.

  The Award Approving Official will be Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the National Institutes of Health.


  **Payment of the Prize:**


  Prizes awarded under this competition will be paid by electronic funds and may be subject to Federal income taxes. Awardees will need to provide an institutional bank account and routing information in order to receive the award funds; prize funds will not be paid to individuals. HHS/NIH will comply with the Internal Revenue Service withholding and reporting requirements, where applicable. The NIH reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (a) cancel, suspend, and/or modify this prize competition, or any part of it, for any reason, and/or (b) not award any prizes if no submissions are deemed worthy.


  **Symposium to Promote Winners & Disseminate Successful Strategies:**


  In addition, each winning entry and honorable mention will be invited to a NIH symposium to present interventions that have enhanced faculty gender diversity and reduced potential sources of gender-based inequities in late 2021. NIH will not provide travel funds for event.

  Each institution (also defined here as an “entity”) must designate a point of contact who is responsible for all correspondence regarding this prize competition. A point of contact representing the entity should be employed by and/or acting at the behest of the entity, such as the President, Provost, Chancellor, or other senior-level administrator.
