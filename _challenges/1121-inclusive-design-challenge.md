### Description

#### Summary

An estimated 25.5 million Americans experience a travel-limiting disability that impacts their access to employment, medical care, and other activities of daily living. The current COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the critical need for vulnerable populations to have on-demand transportation services to access healthcare, pharmacies, grocery stores, and other essential services. Automated vehicles, particularly those designed to be operated exclusively by Level 4 and Level 5 Automated Driving Systems (ADS), hold great promise to enhance freedom of movement for these individuals. However, fulfilling this promise will require innovation and creativity, not only in how vehicles drive themselves, but also in how all users access and interact with them.

Through the Inclusive Design Challenge, the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) seeks innovative, inclusive design features to enable people with physical, sensory, and cognitive disabilities to use automated vehicles, particularly ADS-dedicated vehicles (ADS-DV) that are operated exclusively at Levels 4 and 5 (see Notes on Terminology below for additional detail on terms used throughout this Challenge). Solutions must address one or more aspects of ADS-DV use - such as locating and entering an ADS-DV or interacting with the vehicle in routine and emergency situations - through physical hardware and/or human-machine interface (HMI) designs. Individuals and teams will compete for an overall prize purse ofup to $5,000,000 in a two-stage competition. In Stage I, DOT solicits brief technical proposals for inclusive design features that could then be demonstrated in prototype form by semifinalists in Stage II.

By using a prize competition format, DOT seeks to draw attention to the topic of passenger vehicle accessibility; encourage new cross-disciplinary collaborations; incentivize the development of new approaches and technologies to improve mobility; and tap into the creativity and knowledge of the disability community, researchers, advocates, manufacturers, and entrepreneurs. DOT aims to attract ideas from around the nation to identify new solutions for common access issues.

This Challenge seeks inclusive solutions, referring to features and designs that enable access to and use of a vehicle by people with a wide range of physical, sensory and cognitive disabilities. Technology has already changed how most of us get around. This Challenge seeks to ensure that these new technology-driven mobility options are inclusive of all Americans.

#### Background

DOT is eager to realize the potential mobility benefits that ADS-DVs could bring to people with disabilities. ADS-DVs, could offer greater levels of mobility for individuals who either cannot drive or require a vehicle with extensive modifications, but only if their needs are considered explicitly and incorporated into future ADS-DY designs. DOT recognizes that the diversity of disabilities and resulting implications for vehicle design features makes this a complicated engineering challenge. While some mobility services (e.g., public transportation or for-hire vehicles, such as taxis) currently incorporate some accessibility features, few of these features are universally included in passenger vehicles as part of vehicle design. Meanwhile, aftermarket solutions tend to be expensive and cumbersome.

Several recent publications are provided at [www.transportation.gov/accessibility/inclusivedesign](www.transportation.gov/accessibility/inclusivedesign) to offer further information on the needs, challenges, and opportunities that ADS-DVs introduce for people with disabilities.

#### Challenge Details

DOT seeks ideas for inclusive features that will enable future ADS-DVs to meet the needs of people with disabilities safely, effectively, and efficiently. Participants will compete for cash prizes by developing innovative design solutions to increase access to and use ofADS-DVs for people with disabilities. Such features can be human-machine interfaces, physical hardware designs, or combinations thereof that can allow a person with a physical, sensory, and/or cognitive disability to perform one or more tasks required to use an ADS-DY. Solutions may be proposed as standalone features or integrated into a holistic vehicle design. Successful solutions will show that they have taken into account production feasibility and an understanding of the needs and constraints of both industry and travelers with disabilities. The Department notes that it is seeking to further innovation in inclusive design for ADS-DVs with this Challenge, rather than the development of the Automated Driving Systems themselves. Thus, awards are judged solely on the factors described in this statement, and are not based on the sophistication Of any ADS included as part of a prototype vehicle. See Stage II Prototype/Demonstration below for additional details on prototype expectations and requirements. 

The sections below provide important information on elements to consider as part of your Challenge solution.

##### *Vehicle Platform*

Participants should consider features intended to be incorporated into vehicles that can serve a wide range of communities and are capable of operating at highway speeds. Participants have flexibility in choosing a vehicle to use as a reference or base platform in developing their feature(s), keeping in mind the focus of the Challenge is developing inclusive solutions for ADSDVs that could either function as personal vehicles or as part of a shared private fleet. Please note that the Challenge is not specifically soliciting solutions to be used exclusively in public transportation. However, successful solutions may have application to both private and public transportation.

##### *Vehicle Use*

Participants will develop inclusive design solutions to address one or more of the following tasks that an ADS-Dy user with a disability will need to complete:

* Locating an ADS-Dy -Including, but not limited to, being notified that a vehicle has arrived; identifying the correct vehicle and locating and navigating to the correct vehicle.
* Entering an ADS-DY-Including, but not limited to, unlocking and opening vehicle door(s); deploying and stowing ramps or other equipment enabling access for wheelchair users or people with other physical disabilities or mobility equipment; and closing vehicle door(s).
* Securing Passengers and Mobility Equipment -Including, but not limited to, securing seatbelts and other passenger restraints; securing wheelchairs or other mobility equipment to the vehicle; and accommodating service animals.
* Inputting Information-Including, but not limited to, confirming passenger identity; searching for, entering, and changing a desired destination; confirming the vehicle's destination; selecting a specific drop-off point (e.g., a particular entrance to a large complex or a location with a curb cut or sufficient space to deploy a ramp or other physical device).
* Interacting with the ADS in routine and emergency situations -Including, but not limited to, operating passenger convenience and safety features (e.g., entertainment, window controls, locks, climate control); monitoring the vehicle's location and route progress; changing the vehicle's destination en route; requesting assistance (emergency or non-emergency); understanding and performing appropriate actions in the event of a breakdown or crash.
* Exiting an ADS-DY ---- Including, but not limited to, being notified and confirming that a vehicle has reached its intended destination; releasing passenger and/or mobility equipment restraints; identifying and locating the safe and appropriate door(s) from which to exit the vehicle; recognizing when it is safe to exit a vehicle; opening door(s) and deploying and stowing ramps or other equipment enabling access for passengers and/or mobility equipment (e.g., wheelchairs).

##### *Disability Types*

For the Challenge, inclusiveness will be evaluated, in part, by the extent to which proposed solutions address a range of disabilities and needs. As noted above, applicants will need to demonstrate working engagement(s) with representatives from the disability community in their design process. 

Participants will also focus their efforts by designing solutions for use by one or more of the following groups:

* People with physical disabilities
* People with sensory disabilities
* People with cognitive disabilities
* People with multiple types of disabilities

##### *Production Feasibility*

DOT seeks proposals through this Challenge that strike a balance between innovation and nearterm implementation. For innovation to have the desired impact, implementation is critical. Participants are expected to discuss factors related to the feasibility of producing their solution(s), including the maturity of the technology underlying the inclusive design elements of the proposed design, as well as cost and other production considerations. "Production" here refers to the incorporation of the proposed solution(s) into a vehicle as original equipment, integration into an existing vehicle platform as part of an aftermarket modification, or a holistic reimagining of passenger vehicle design with a focus on seamlessly integrating inclusive features.
