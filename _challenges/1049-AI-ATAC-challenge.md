### Description
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg}

<p>The Naval Information Warfare Systems Command (NAVWARSYSCOM) and the Program Executive Office for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (PEO C4I) are conducting the Artificial Intelligence Applications to Autonomous Cybersecurity (AI ATAC), pronounced &ldquo;AI attack&rdquo; Challenge (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;the Challenge&rdquo;). The Navy&rsquo;s Information Assurance and Cybersecurity Program Office (PMW 130) seeks to automate the Security Operations Center (SOC) using artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) beginning with the endpoint.&nbsp; Modern malware strains, especially sophisticated malware created by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, have shown capabilities that mutate faster than signature-based protection tools can adapt. PMW 130 solicits white papers describing endpoint-based security technologies and the corresponding tool for evaluation in the AI ATAC Prize Challenge competition.</p>

<!-- Prizes start -->
### Prizes
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg}

<p>The Challenge winners will be notified via email. NAVWARSYSCOM will announce the winners on the Challenge.gov website and via appropriate channels.</p>
<p>NAVWARSYSCOM has established $150,000 as the total amount set aside for cash prizes under this Challenge. A $100,000 first place cash prize will be awarded to the winning entry. A $50,000 second place cash prize will be awarded to the second place winner.&nbsp; In the unlikely event of a tie, NAVWARSYSCOM will determine an equitable method of distributing the cash prizes.</p>
<p>If a prize goes to a team of Participants, NAVWARSYSCOM will award the cash prize to the individual/team&rsquo;s point of contact registered on the Challenge website, for further distribution to the team, as the team members see fit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NAWARSYSCOM may award, pursuant to Title 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2371b, a follow-on production contract or transaction to one or more participants who successfully demonstrated an effective AI/ML approach under this Challenge. This Challenge, however, does not in any way obligate NAVWARSYSCOM to procure any of the items within the scope of this Challenge from the winners</p>
<p>Tax treatment of prizes will be handled in accordance with U.S. Internal Revenue Service guidelines. The winner must provide a U.S. TIN (e.g., a SSN, TIN, EIN) to receive the cash prize.</p>

<div>Oak Ridge, TN 37830</div>
<p>All questions regarding the Challenge should be sent via email to <a href="mailto:AIATAC.PRIZE.CHALLENGE@NAVY.MIL">AIATAC.PRIZE.CHALLENGE@NAVY.MIL</a></p>
<p><strong>Terms and Conditions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>These terms and conditions apply to all participants in the Challenge.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Agreement to Terms</strong></span></p>
<p>The Participant agrees to comply with and be bound by the AI ATAC Challenge Background and Rules (&ldquo;the Rules&rdquo;) as well as the Terms and Conditions contained herein.&nbsp; The Participant also agrees that the decisions of the Government, in connection with all matters relating to this Challenge are binding and final.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eligibility</span></strong></p>
<p>The Challenge is open to individual Participants, teams of Participants, and commercial entities. Commercial entities must be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States (U.S.). Individual Participants and all members of teams of Participants must all be U.S. citizens or U.S. Permanent Residents and be 18 years or older as of 08 July 2019. All Participants (commercial entities or individuals) must have a Social Security Number (SSN), Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), or Employer Identification Number (EIN) in order to receive a prize.

### Judging Criteria
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg}

<p><strong>Performance. </strong>The degree to which the integrated design (including sensor, platform, and data analysis) indicates an ability to achieve or exceed the necessary data requirements for production of the WMM (see target performance metrics in <a href="https://www.magquest.com/additional-resources/">Additional Resources</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Technical Feasibility. </strong>The extent to which the design uses technically sound methods, the solver identifies potential risks, and proposes credible mitigation strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Feasibility and Cost Fidelity. </strong>The degree to which the design accounts for real-world implementation and operation in the near term (e.g., 5 years), as well as the ability to continuously and reliably collect data for several WMM iterations (e.g., 30 years).</p>
<p><strong>Innovation. </strong>The degree to which the design creates potential efficiencies in time, money, or other resources.</p>
<p><strong>Team. </strong>The extent to which the solver or team demonstrates sufficient expertise that may be needed to advance their integrated design to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 5, and preferably 6, within a potential timeframe of two years (e.g., by September 2021). (see Technology Readiness Assessment in <a href="https://www.magquest.com/additional-resources/">Additional Resources</a> for more information on TRLs)</p>
