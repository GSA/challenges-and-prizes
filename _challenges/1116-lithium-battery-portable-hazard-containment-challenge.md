  Lithium batteries’ benefits of increased capabilities at a reduced weight
  outweigh their inherent risks in many industrial, commercial and some military
  applications. However, these benefits do not outweigh the inherent risk of
  transporting the batteries. For example, most commercial passenger airlines do
  not allow lithium batteries to be packed inside checked luggage due to the
  inherent fire hazard in a cargo hold, which represents an unacceptable risk.
  Likewise, military (and other users) transportation of lithium batteries
  represents risks that are also sometimes unacceptable. A solution that
  develops a containment system to carry batteries that suitably mitigates the
  inherent hazards is desired to allow more applications, commercial and
  military, to benefit from the use of rechargeable (called “secondary”) and
  non-rechargeable (called “primary”) lithium batteries.


  The objective for this Lithium Battery Man Portable Containment Challenge is
  to demonstrate a method to transport military-qualified lithium primary and
  secondary batteries that mitigates hazards generated during a thermal runaway
  event. Since some lithium batteries are more reactive than other types, a
  proposed solution does not have to accommodate all types of current military
  lithium batteries, but a solution that does accommodate more lithium battery
  types is more valuable for the purposes of this challenge. Man portable can be
  defined as a single person carry up to 50 Lbs, which will include up to 12.5
  Lbs of batteries. The challenge assumes no battery charging or discharging
  will occur during transportation of lithium batteries.


  Additional threshold parameters include:


  * Contain or extinguish all fire and large (greater than 5 micrometers
  diameter) particulates generated during a thermal runaway event

  * Limit and neutralize (reduce combustibility and/or toxicity) all released
  gases from the container

  * Be stackable with secure attachment points for carrying straps, handles,
  tie-down

  * Securely immobilize the contained batteries

  * Provide a degree of shock and vibration isolation for the batteries
  contained

  * Provide a degree of water and moisture protection for the batteries
  contained

  * Physical dimension must have a single side that is less than 36” in
  circumference and 11.5” in radius


  Additional stretch objectives parameters include:


  * Be capable of containing all vent gases

  * Be capable of reducing the hazards of released toxic vent gases

  * Ability to convey externally that a hazardous event has occurred inside the
  container

  * Ability to suppress or extinguish the thermal runaway event internal to the
  container

  * Reduction in physical dimension and/or weight to improve portability


  The challenge will be completed via a four Phased approach. Phase I objective
  is to provide a concept “white paper” from which a Virtual Presentation of
  White Paper Concept may be invited. Phase II objective is to design a detailed
  solution and demonstrate a limited Proof-of-Concept (POC). Phase III objective
  is to fabricate and demonstrate a Technology Development Prototype. Phase IV
  will include any potential follow-on award(s). The Government may, at its
  discretion, award follow-on(s) for the continuous development of the
  technology development. The Government does not currently have funding for
  follow-on award(s).


  Detailed solution is defined as a technical illustration or Computer aided
  Design (CAD) model of the proposed solution with consideration to threshold
  parameters. POC is defined as a small project created to test whether a
  certain idea or theory about the product can be implemented. Technology
  Development Prototype is defined as a product that is capable to be tested to
  successfully demonstrate the ability to meet the challenge objectives.


  Phase I objective is to “virtually” (e.g. via a phone or video conference)
  present your concept. Phase I will be conducted in two phases: Initial
  submission of White Paper Concept followed by an invitation to provide a
  Virtual Presentation of White Paper Concept. The White Paper Concept shall
  describe in detail the Challenge objectives your solution will address, how
  your proposed solution would achieve those objectives, how if selected for
  Phase II you intend to design your solution, what POC will be developed and
  evaluated and describe your plans for how you would intend for your solution
  to be manufactured and sold.


  The Government will select up to fifteen (15) White Paper Concepts for
  invitation for a Virtual Presentation of their proposed concept to a panel of
  judges. The Virtual Presentation shall provide a summary of the white paper
  contents and include detail on how you intend to accomplish phase II
  objectives, provide a notional schedule, and a list of any concerns,
  clarifications or other questions you have regarding resources or information
  you need technical assistance with to accomplish the challenge. Up to five (5)
  winners will be selected to participate in Phase II.


  Phase II objective is to design a detailed solution and demonstrate any
  Proof-of-Concept (POC) needed to provide confidence in the design. Results
  from the detailed design and POC testing will be provided to the Government
  team via another Virtual Presentation. Presentation should also include data
  supporting effectiveness of design along with identification of what design
  attributes will be considered vendor versus government purpose rights. Up to
  three (3) winners will be selected to participate in Phase III.


  Phase III objective is to demonstrate a Technology Development Prototype. The
  Technology Development Prototype will be required to demonstrate the
  capability of withstanding the thermal runaway event of four lithium-ion
  military BB-2590 Bren-Tronics BT-70791CG or similar ~300 Wh Li-ion batteries.
  A single center-located battery should be triggered artificially by means of
  thermal abuse (e.g. via heat tape or some other suitable method). The
  technology development prototype should demonstrate the capability at ambient
  temperature to contain the thermal event without releasing flame, sparks or
  large particles while maintaining a surface temperature that would not trigger
  the combustion of adjacent materials. The container should also limit and
  preferably neutralize (reduce combustibility and/or toxicity) all released
  gases. Note that this type of testing is inherently hazardous, and Government
  personnel will consult with you on the safe execution of this POC in advance.
  All three winners may be selected to participate in Phase IV.


  Phase IV the Government may choose to award follow-on FAR-based procurement
  contract, an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) award (under 10 U.S.C. 2371 or
  2371b), a procurement contract for experimental purposes (10 U.S.C 2373), or a
  combination of awards under those authorities to any chosen participant in
  this prize challenge.
