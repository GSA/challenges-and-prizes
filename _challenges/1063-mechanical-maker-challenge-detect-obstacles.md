### Description
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg .challenge-section}

<p>With its sulfuric acid clouds, temperatures over 450°C, and 92 times the surface pressure of Earth, Venus is one of the most hostile planetary environments in the solar system. Prior missions have only survived hours! But an automaton (or clockwork mechanical robot) could solve this problem. By utilizing high-temperature alloys, the clockwork rover would survive for months, allowing it to collect and return valuable long-term science data from the surface of Venus. To learn more about the automaton rover, see this link on the project or this video.</p>
<p>At NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, we are turning this innovative concept into reality under a NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) funded study. We’ve been working hard on this project, but we could use YOUR help to address some of our toughest mechanical design challenges! The Mechanical Maker Challenges are a series of challenges seeking to engage YOUR creativity to invent mechanical ways of performing traditionally electrical tasks. Challenges will be released in series, one at a time.</p>
<h3>Our Second Challenge: The Mechanical Obstacle Detector</h3>
<p>Current rovers sense obstacles and navigate around them utilizing image recognition software. Unfortunately, image recognition requires a lot of processing power, which is something that doesn’t exist for Venus because of its high temperatures (no way to keep advanced electronics cool). Further, Venus has night which is 60 Earth days long. We need to system that will detect obstacles during the night, without complex electronics, and provide a mechanical output to our rover to let it know it needs to change directions. When an obstacle is detected, the rover will reverse directions, turn, and then try again in a new direction.</p> 
<p>The Challenge: Design a mechanical sensor that can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detect obstacles that are larger than 0.35 meters tall, or holes/valleys deeper than 0.35 meters, as these are larger than half of the diameter of the tire.</li>
<ul><li>See examples of obstacles in challenge details.</li></ul>
<li>Is not triggered by obstacles which are less than 0.3 meters tall or holes/valleys 0.3 meters deep.</li>
<ul>
<li>Wheels are large enough to scale obstacles which are this size or smaller</li></ul>
<li>Detect if the rover tilts by more than 30 degrees.</li>
<ul><li>With angles greater than 30 degrees, the rover is at risk for tipping</li></ul>
<li>When an obstacles is detected, move a pin by 3 cm.</li></ul>
<p><strong>What to Submit: </strong>A three-page description of the design as well as a separate blueprint illustrating how the concept works. Video demonstrations of working prototypes are encouraged but not required. If a prototype is built, a video of the prototype thoroughly describing the design should be provided via a publically accessible internet link. Maximum submission size is 8 MB, therefore videos must be posted online.</p>
<p>This challenge is being run in collaboration with Philadelphia Makers Meetup.</p>

### Judging Criteria
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg .challenge-section}

<h3>Judging Panel</h3>
<p>Judging occurs in two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>All entries will be reviewed by mechanical engineers at JPL, and down selected to the top 6.</li>
<li>The top 6 entries will then be judged by senior mechanical engineers and chief engineers, and feedback on those concepts will be provided to the submitter. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Judging Criteria</h3>
<p>Each design will be judged on the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the concept likely to meet the challenge obstacles avoidance requirements? (50%)</li>
<ul>
<li>Would the system detect holes/valleys greater than 0.35 meters tall/deep? (worth 20%)</li>
<li>Would the system detect slopes or combinations of slopes/obstacles that could result in an angle of greater than 30 degrees? (worth 10%)</li>
<li>Would the system ignore holes/valleys less than 0.3 meters tall/deep? (worth 10%)</li>
<li>Would the design produce a 3 cm displacement of a shaft/pin with 50N of force? (worth 5%)</li>
<li>Is the design compatible with the current rover architecture? (worth 5%)</li>
</ul>
<li>Is the concept feasible to construct? (30%)</li>
<ul>
<li>Is the design something that could actually be constructed?</li>
<li>Are there any practical limitations to implementing the design?</li>
</ul>
<li>Can the concept be adjusted to work in Venus conditions? (20%)</li>
<ul><li>Would the concept, if built out of the right materials, operate at Venus’s high temperatures?</li>
<li>Would the concept operate at Venus pressure?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: Prototypes of the system or components are encouraged but not required.</strong> Prototypes may increase the score in the last two judging criteria.  </p>
