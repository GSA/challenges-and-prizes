### Description
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg .challenge-section}

<p>AHRQ is seeking technological solutions that ease administrative and information management burdens, and support patient activation and engagement, especially among Americans that may have low health literacy or limited English language proficiency. These technical solutions should leverage evidence-based standards.</p>
<p>Solutions in this Challenge will improve care communications during transitions, develop and use standardized processes for leveraging and transferring data from electronic health records.</p>
<p>Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) serves as a standalone data exchange standard but can be used in partnership with existing widely used standards, accelerating the develop process for digital solutions. FHIR is used to address the people, processes, and technology needed to send, receive, and use digital care plans and optimize medication reconciliation.&nbsp; Winning solutions that use FHIR in this Challenge would enable patients, families, and caregivers to receive and understand hospital discharge instructions and care plans while easing administrative burden on physicians, nurses, and staff at discharging hospitals.</p>
<p>The Challenge will include two phases.</p>
