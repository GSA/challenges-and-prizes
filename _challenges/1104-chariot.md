### Description 
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg .challenge-section}

<p>The CHARIoT Challenge is a dual track challenge covering an Augmented Reality Contest and an Internet of Things-based Contest.</p>
<p>Startups, developers, data gurus, engineers, and user experience experts are challenged to develop solutions that deliver first responders augmented reality interfaces leveraging data streams from buildings and city sensors. Solutions must be designed to assist first responders in four (4) emergency scenarios: wildfires, floods, active shooter situations, and tunnel collapses. These interfaces will improve decision-making and resource deployment capabilities for public safety personnel, ensuring Americaâ€™s first responders have the tools to effectively save lives.</p>
<p>AR contestants are challenged to concept and design augmented reality interfaces for two public safety users: Incident Command Officers and boots-on-the-ground First Responders. IoT contestants will emulate accurate smart city and public safety personal area network data by first determining which sensors that would be most useful for first responders and then creating data transmitters of the sensor data based on the provided emergency scenarios. The top selected data streams, developed by IoT contestants, will serve as a core data infrastructure for high performing AR contestants at a final live event competition at a public safety training center.</p>
<p>Both contests consist of four (4) phases:</p?

<p><strong>Concept Paper</strong></p>
<p>Phase 1 invites all eligible participants to submit a concept paper outlining their proposed team&rsquo;s solution, approach, capabilities, knowledge and skills for this contest. Participants must document their proposed solution structure for each of the four emergency scenarios, including the list of sensor data they would provide and a corresponding justification for their selection; their methodology for data acquisition and sources; and proposed physical hardware.</p>

<p><strong>Concept &amp; Video</strong></p>
<p>Phase 1 invites all eligible contestants to submit a concept paper and video outlining their team&rsquo;s proposed solution, approach, capabilities, knowledge and skills for this contest. Contestants must document their proposed augmented reality (AR) interfaces -holograms for incident command perspective and heads-up displays for first responders - for the four emergency scenarios.</p>

<td style="width: 435.2px; height: 95px;">
<p><strong>Demonstration of Data Streams</strong></p>
<p>Invited contestants from Phase 1 will participate in a challenge kickoff webinar, during which PSCR will describe the four emergency scenarios, the corresponding public safety tasks for each emergency scenario, and how the emulated data would be utilized in Phase 3 and Phase 4 of the Challenge. The rest of Phase 2 is focused on contestants&rsquo; creation of the emulated sensor data and demonstrating the transmission of these data streams for at least 2 of the 4 emergency scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Augmented Reality Interfaces and Public Safety Use Case</strong></p>
<p>Invited contestants from Phase 1 will focus their attention on Magic Leap training and public safety use case training to develop or enhance an augmented reality interface prototype for evaluation. Invited contestants that indicated in their concept papers that they need to be partnered with a public safety agency may have additional webinars or conference calls to connect with a local public safety agency.</p>

<p><strong>Evaluation of Data Streams</strong></p>
<p>The IoT data contestants will incorporate feedback from the 2020 Public Safety Stakeholder Meeting and collaborate with external public safety mentors and advisors to finalize their emulated data for the four emergency scenarios. Contestants will submit a wireless network and their data transmitters pre-configured for the four emergency scenarios for evaluation by the Judging panel.</p>

<p><strong>AR Heads-Up Displays &amp; Holograms</strong></p>
<p>Contestants will create their AR interfaces in collaboration with their public safety agency. The AR interfaces should be designed to be utilized by public safety, with holograms for the incident command perspective and heads-up display for use by first responders. The AR interfaces should be developed using the NIST PSCR provided IoT Disaster Scenario Dataset.</p>
