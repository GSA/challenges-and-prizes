### Description
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg}

<div class="description">
        <p>The EW mission system payload prize challenge aims to identify EW mission system payloads that will 1) Maximize payload performance to meet or exceed MUX mission system desired payload performance levels, 2) Minimize mission payload Size, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWaP-C) requirements, 3) Maximize mission system payload(s) modularity, 4) Minimize mission payload maintainability and sustainability requirements, 5) Maximize mission system payload reliability, 6) Maximize a mission system payload's ability to be reconfigured and/or upgraded to adapt to and address emergent threats to the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) in highly contested environments, 7) Provide a mission systems model(s), and 8) Minimize implementation, and Operations and Support (O&amp;S) cost(s).</p>
<p>The EW mission system payload prize challenge will leverage model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methods.&nbsp; The prize challenge will be conducted in two phases:&nbsp; initial qualification and final submission evaluation.&nbsp; During the initial qualification phase, interested participants must submit an initial application in order for the Government to determine whether the interested participant is eligible to receive the Government-Furnished Information and starter model.&nbsp; During the final submission phase, invited participants will be provided with a starter model generated in No Magic Cameo Enterprise ArchitectureTM, Version 19.0 (Unified Architecture Framework (UAF)).&nbsp; Participants will extend the starter model to substantiate their payload design concept and submit the extended model to be scored against a standardized grading rubric. Participants will also submit a written description of their model that includes mapping of requirements and capabilities to UAF views, along with a list of supporting physics-based relationships and assumptions.&nbsp; Within the written description, participants must also address questions about compliance with </span><span lang="EN">Federal Acquisition Regulation and Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement requirements and provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for the cost to develop the proposed payload and for the cost to produce the payload on a per unit basis.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award the prizes to the proposals that comply with the requirements of the prize challenge and, all factors considered, provide the greatest overall benefit to the Government.</span></p>
