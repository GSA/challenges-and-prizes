### Netlify - Getting Started [Work in Progress]

Login to Netlify CMS with your GitHub credentials → [https://www.challenge.gov/admin/](https://www.challenge.gov/admin/)

  

You will land on a page with the Challenges Collection already open.

-   Think of a Collection as a folder of files
    
-   Each challenge is a separate file
    

  

The Challenges Collection holds all of the individual files of the OPEN challenges

-   Open challenges are visible from the front page of challenge.gov
    
-   Only use Netlify to add NEW challenges or edit a challenge you have entered as NEW into Netlify
    
-   DO NOT edit a challenge that does not have the layout: front-matter-data-markdownify-content
    

  

The left sidebar shows a list of all available collections

-   The Archived Challenges Collection contains the files of the archived challenges
    

	-   Some of theses files appear only as a blank white box, that’s ok
    
	-   DO NOT EDIT these files
    

  

At the top left of the landing page you will see three options:

-   Contents - this will return you to the Challenges Collection
    
-   Workflow - this is where you are able to view/edit a NEW challenge
    

	-   This will also be used to track your challenges progress towards Go Live
    

-   Media - this the media library, it mirrors the /assets/netlify-uploads/ folder on GitHub
    

	-   All images/docs that you upload will live here
    
	-   I have preloaded all existing Agency logos
