### To Add a New Challenge using Netlify CMS

1.  From the Challenges Collection click on New Challenge

	a.  You can also click on Quick Add from the top right corner of the page

2.  Fill out the form fields  

3.  Click Save - this will save your progress and do three things

	a.  Que Federalist to start building your preview

		i.  Give federalist about 4 minutes to build your preview

		ii.  You will see a Check for Preview blue link appear at the top

			1.  This will Not refresh automatically

				a.  Click in about 4 mins, if your preview is ready it will switch to View Preview

	    iii.  Federalist will rebuild the preview Every Time you click Save

            1.  Try not to make a ton of edits/saves as Federalist rebuilds each time you click save. If the previous build did not finish then it adds it to the que and you will create a longer wait for yourself.

	b.  Create a new branch and pull request (PR) in GitHub

		i.  You can also view the preview link from the PR as usual

		ii.  This PR will be initialized with a netlify-cms/draft label

			1.  Moving your challenge through the Workflow will update this label

	c.  Create a card for your new challenge in the Workflow
    
        i.  This card will be added to the Drafts column in the workflow
