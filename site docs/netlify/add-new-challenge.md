### To Add a New Challenge using Netlify CMS

1.  From the *All Challenges* Collection click on *New Challenge*

	a.  You can also click on *Quick Add* from the top right corner of the page

2.  Fill out the form fields  

3.  Click Save - this will save your progress and automatically do three things:

	1.  Que Federalist to start building your preview

		-  Give federalist about 4 minutes to build your preview

		-  You will see a *Check for Preview* blue link appear at the top

			-  This will Not refresh automatically

				-  Click *Check for Preview* in about 4 mins, if your preview is ready it will switch to *View Preview*

	    -  Federalist will rebuild the preview every time you click *Save*

            -  Try to include several edits in one *Save* as Federalist rebuilds each time you click *Save*. If the previous build did not finish then it adds it to the queue and you will create a longer wait for yourself.

	2.  Create a new branch and pull request (PR) in GitHub

		-  You can also view the preview link from the PR as usual

		-  This PR will be initialized with a netlify-cms/draft label

			-  Moving your challenge through the Workflow will update this label

	3.  Create a card for your new challenge in the Workflow

        -  This card will be added to the Drafts column in the workflow
