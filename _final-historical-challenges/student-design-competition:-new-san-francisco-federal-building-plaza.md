      coherence, and clarity of vision in achieving the goal of activating the plaza

description: '[UPDATED 1/8/2018]    We are pleased to announce the winning entries
  to the GSA Student Design Competition for the New San Francisco Federal Building
  Plaza. The competition challenged students to activate the existing plaza through
  program and design interventions. The jury evaluated 63 entries which met the submission
  guidelines and deadline requirements. Entries were evaluated against the judging
  criteria that were published in the competition announcement, which were Creativity,
  Context, Community, Feasibility, and Value. The more successful entries, including
  the winning entries, proposed a new program and offered creative new ways of using
  the plaza in order to activate the public space. While the competition awards three
  prizes, the jury felt that in light of the high number of excellent submissions,
  that they would like to recognize a fourth entry with a special honorable mention.    <strong><span
  style="text-decoration: underline;">Honorable Mention – “San Francisco Federal Plaza
  Urban Garden,” Nancy Spaulding</span></strong>  The proposal involves an extensive
  landscape design renovation that features a substantial addition of trees and other
  plantings suited to the climate. The design features an educational “teaching garden,”
  which might educate children from the childcare center within the building, as well
  as the general public. The featured planting would produce food for birds, insect
  pollinators, and humans. The improvements have the potential to attract visitors,
  including disadvantaged users, to the plaza. The proposal appeals to building occupants
  and addresses important community issues. Members of the jury imagine that the produce
  grown in the plaza could be served in the café in farm-to-table style. The proposal
  infuses the plaza with elements from the natural environment. The design addresses
  the needs of the site but does not inhibit future uses. The proposed forest engages
  visually with people in the upper floors of the federal building and adjacent buildings.
  The jury commends the urban garden proposal for its optimism.    <strong><span style="text-decoration:
  underline;">Third Prize – “Allegro,” by Dan Kaiser</span></strong>  This entry proposes
  an intervention that blurs the distinction between art and landscape. The formally
  aggressive intervention is inspired by sound waves and the existing building’s form,
  combined to create seating and play space that is intended to transform the space
  at night. The inclusion of relevant case studies was useful to understand the design
  intent and feasibility of this proposal. The design refines the café building to
  maintain the original urban design intent of having a strong, well-defined corner,
  while also addressing the proposed new plaza design. The jury commends the creativity
  and quality of this visually stimulating proposal, which creates the potential for
  success whether people occupy the space as intended by the proposal or not.    <strong><span
  style="text-decoration: underline;">Second Prize – “Terraform,” by Thomas Backman</span></strong>  The
  entry proposes an ambitious renovation that is unique among the field of entries
  in that it proposed an entirely new programmatic use for the plaza. The proposed
  terrace enables occupants and the public to use this new semi-private space in new
  dramatic ways. The proposal entertains an expanded view of what is possible with
  the café and suggests the potential that the site may have for more retail and additional
  dining options to attract people and activate the plaza. The design establishes
  the plaza as a part of the city of San Francisco, borrowing symbols from the landscape
  of the city while preserving the national significance of the federal building.
  The entry acknowledges the layered contexts of the cultural landscape of the city
  and the rest of the country. The jury commends the proposal for the well-integrated
  consideration of programming, landscape, and architectural design.    <strong><span
  style="text-decoration: underline;">First Prize – “Keeping Time,” by Margaret C.
  Weighner</span></strong>  The entry is rooted in a conceptually strong and engaging
  proposal with significant potential to activate the plaza, however it is implemented
  with an even handed approach that is both respectful and complimentary of the existing
  building design, artwork, and surrounding context. The proposal challenges conventional
  notions of landscape architecture and urban design with a highly creative and contemporary
  intervention, communicated through a professional-quality presentation. A “floating
  orb,” traverses the site and beyond in motion reflective of the celestial movement
  of the moon, reminding visitors of the connection between the site, city, nation,
  and even the cosmos. The entry succeeds in explaining the general feasibility of
  the proposal through detailing an aluminum orb structure that would move along suspension
  cables while being illuminated by a heliostat. Visible at certain times from the
  busy pedestrian thoroughfares of nearby Market Street and United Nations Plaza,
  the orb extends the visibility of the plaza beyond the property line, engaging with
  both building occupants and the public. The entry inspired jury members to observe
  that the plaza could be further programmed as an art exhibition space for a series
  of similar conceptual art installations or performances that would be temporary
  or impermanent, citing MoMA PS1 in New York as a case study. Jurors used the words
  “thoughtful,” “big-picture,” and “conceptually bold,” to describe this entry, and
  award it with the first prize in the competition.    &nbsp;    <strong><span style="text-decoration:
  underline;">Meet the Jurors:</span></strong>    <b>San Francisco Federal Building

  tab.    &nbsp;    [ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT]    Continuing a legacy of outstanding
  public architecture, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence
  Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented designers and artists to
  design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to
  demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost,
  constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior
  workplaces for civilian federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning
  to our democratic values.    In this context, the GSA invites students in architecture,
  landscape, and urban design programs to envision a design intervention that activates
  the New San Francisco Federal Building plaza. Winning ideas will also address the
  Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture, building tenant needs for the facility,
  community goals, feasibility, and will also achieve the best value for the American
  taxpayer through good design. The intervention may take the form of physical renovation
  of the plaza, programming new use(s), and/or some other means of transformation
  designed to activate public space.    The New San Francisco Federal Building located
  at 90 7th street in San Francisco, California, was designed by Morphosis. The project
  was designed between 1999 and 2002. Construction began in 2003 and was completed
  in 2007. This year celebrates its 10th year of occupancy.    The distinctive building
  has become a landmark in San Francisco. Its layout and functions celebrate the importance
  of the city and the urban environment, combining amenities and public space that
  are designed to enhance the immediate area and the adjacent neighborhood. The offices
  support the energy and spirit of those who work there and those who visit. Its systems
  are outstanding examples of integrated engineering and sustainable design, reflecting
  the wise stewardship of limited resources. Together, these attributes make this
  a project that has stimulated critical interest.    The building is a model of GSA’s
  Design Excellence program. As a public space, the original vision for the plaza
  was that it would be a welcome civic space that is flexible and allows for outdoor
  dining, concerts, and markets. Since the completion of the project 10 years ago,
  only the cafe uses the plaza for outdoor dining, and no concerts, markets, or any
  other public functions have used this space. This competition seeks ideas that activate
  the plaza for the benefit of the building users and general public.    <strong>Questions:</strong>    Please

  to all contestants, we may not be able to answer questions posted to the discussion
  board after 5pm Eastern (2pm Pacific) on Monday 11/20/2017.    <strong>Links:</strong>    <a
