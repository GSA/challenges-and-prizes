description: "<p><strong>Challenge Summary</strong></p>\r\n<p>The &ldquo;Improving
  Care for People with Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and Related Dementias Using Technology
  (iCare-AD/ADRD)&rdquo; Challenge is a Eureka prize competition in which the National
  Institute on Aging (NIA), part of the National Institutes of Health, rewards and
  spurs the development of solutions for a technology-based application, fostering
  connections between relevant stakeholders to use technology, or the development
  of new technology applications to improve dementia care coordination and/or care
  navigation. Though the solution should foster connections between relevant stakeholders
  to use technology or develop new technology applications, it may be targeted at
  consumers (persons with dementia (PWD), caregivers), healthcare providers, healthcare
  service organizations, and/or health systems, and/or community, local, or state
  governments. Specific methods for stimulating uptake and use of the product must
  be included with the working proof-of-concept demonstration. Please see the &ldquo;Submission
  Requirements and Template&rdquo; section for the necessary submission information.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Challenge
  Description</strong></p>\r\n<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) announces the
  &ldquo;Improving Care for People with Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and Related Dementias
  Using Technology (iCare-AD/ADRD)&rdquo; Challenge. The goal of this challenge is
  to improve the quality of care for persons living with Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease
  and related dementias (AD/ADRD) by establishing proof-of-concept for the creation
  of a widely accessible and innovative technology tool(s) that addresses unmet needs
  in care coordination and/or care navigation through the health system. For the purpose
  of this challenge, &ldquo;related dementias&rdquo; will include frontotemporal dementia,
  Lewy Body dementia and vascular cognitive impairment/dementia.</p>\r\n<p>This challenge
  is intended to stimulate innovation in use of technology to improve care coordination
  and/or navigation and/or aid with the care experience, so that overall dementia
  care quality is improved. This challenge invites solutions that involve the development
  of an IT system-level, computer, mobile, and/or other form of technology-based application.&nbsp;
  The solutions may involve creation of a new technology application, and/or modification
  or novel implementation of an existing technology. &nbsp;The solutions may be targeted
  at consumers (persons with dementia or caregivers), healthcare providers, healthcare
  service organizations, and/or health systems, and/or community, local, or state
  government. Specific methods for stimulating uptake and use of the solutions must
  be included with the proof-of-concept demonstrations.</p>\r\n<p>A working demonstration
  of the product is required. Specific target markets or characteristics of end users
  must be identified.</p>\r\n<p>The Challenge is expected to foster connections between
  relevant stakeholders to use technology to improve dementia care coordination and/or
  care navigation. &nbsp;Collaboration with and connections between relevant healthcare
  stakeholders are encouraged. Collaboration across organizations, for example, physician
  practices, nursing homes, assisted-living facilities and smart technology vendors,
  is also encouraged. Examples of possible solvers include small businesses, individuals
  -- including but not limited to people living with dementia and caregivers -- midsize
  to large technology companies, health insurance companies, electronic health record
  (EHR) vendors, students working collaboratively across multiple disciplines, health
  systems, states, and/or counties implementing care coordination programs.</p>\r\n<p>Examples
  that would fulfill the purpose of the Challenge include, but are not limited to:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><em><span
  style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Aiding effective communication between clinicians
  and patients and families</span></em>: Solvers could develop a mobile application
  to assist persons with dementia (PWD) and caregivers at primary care and specialty
  physician visits. The application could be tailored to individual care needs, prepopulated
  with diagnoses and medications used, and include prompts for questions to ask clinicians
  or links to local resources and/or relevant insurance coverage information.</li>\r\n<li><em><span
  style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Aiding care access and access to relevant
  community resources and/or enhancing user-friendliness of existing service access
  interfaces</span></em>: Solvers could use technology to assist PWD with aging in
  place, improve access to appropriate transportation options using smart devices,
  and coordinate health care visits.</li>\r\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration:
  underline;\">Improving care coordination</span></em>: A collaboration between a
  technology company, EHR vendor, and nursing home chain could yield EHR-based methods
  to improve care coordination. Care coordination solutions may also involve behavioral
  &ldquo;nudges&rdquo; for care providers and/or care recipients using smart technology
  and may be designed for direct use by PWD and caregivers.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The
  full description, rules, and details of this challenge are defined on NIA&rsquo;s
  challenge details page (<strong><a href=\"https://nia.nih.gov/challenge-prize\">https://nia.nih.gov/challenge-prize</a></strong>).</p>"
