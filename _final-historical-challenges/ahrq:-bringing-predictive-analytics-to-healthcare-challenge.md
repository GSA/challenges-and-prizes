description: "<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Problem Statement</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span
  lang=\"EN\">Traditional approaches in health services research rely on rigorous
  methods, the availability of recent data, and peer review to assure the highest
  quality of analyses. However, some decision-makers must make policy decisions quickly
  with the current information available and cannot wait until new analyses are complete.
  Predictive analytics and related methods may offer a solution to balance the need
  for rapid information and academic rigor. While predictive analytics and related
  methods have been used successfully in many fields, their use to understand how
  healthcare is delivered is largely unexplored.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Challenge
  Goal</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The purpose of the Predicting Health
  Care Utilization Challenge is to explore how predictive analytics and related methods
  may be applied and contribute to understanding healthcare issues, AHRQ invites applicants
  to use predictive analytics and related methods to estimate hospital inpatient utilization
  for: (1) the U.S. overall, (2) the four U.S. Census Regions, and (3) selected medical
  conditions. Building on AHRQ&rsquo;s current data infrastructure, AHRQ will provide
  approved applicants customized analytic files that includes hospital inpatient discharge
  data for several years.</span></p>"
