description: 'DISCLAIMER: The following is a FICTITIOUS story meant for providing
  a realistic context for the Codebreaker Challenge and is not tied in any way to
  actual events.    NSA has discovered that the leadership of a terrorist organization
  is using a new method of communicating secret messages to their operatives in the
  field. A copy of the program being used by one of the terrorists has been recovered
  along with an archive of text files that are believed to contain hidden messages.
  At first glance, the program appears to simply check stock information, but this
  is likely a ruse to make it appear innocuous. Your mission is to reverse engineer
  this software and develop capabilities to exploit the secret messaging component.
  There are 4 different tasks for you to complete, with each increasing in difficulty
  and building off the previous task(s).    To get started, register for an account
  using your .edu email address. Then,visit the <a href="https://codebreaker.ltsnet.net/challenge">Challenge</a>
  page to receive your instructions for starting on the first task in the challenge.'
