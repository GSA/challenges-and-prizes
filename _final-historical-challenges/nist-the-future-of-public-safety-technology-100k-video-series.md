      including a head judge for each Project (the "Head Judge"), will select from
      the eligible entries based on certain factors determined by the Sponsor available
      on Tongal.com. Without limiting the preceding sentence, and in addition to any
      factors that may be separately stated on the Challenge Community Brief &amp;
      Assets Page for the Challenge, the judging criteria shall be: (1) viability
      of the entry as a premise for the final objective of the Challenge; (2) creativity;
      and (3) effectiveness in promotion of the brand.</li>    <li>The entries with

      Official Rules as the "<strong>Entry Finalists</strong>," and will be eligible,

      designated for such place of finish in the money on the Challenge Community
      Brief &amp; Assets Page for this Challenge.</li>    <li>In the case of a tie,
      the tie will be broken by the ranking of the Head Judge based on the judging
      criteria. If multiple entries in a challenge are substantially similar to one
      another, as determined by the judges for the Challenge, the entry that was first
      submitted to Tongal will be judged, and all other substantially similar entries
      will be rejected. All decisions of the judges are final.</li>  </ul>  </li>    <li><strong>Payments:</strong>
      The Challenge winners will be paid prizes directly from NIST, not through Tongal.com.
      Prior to payment, winners will be required to verify eligibility. The verification
      process with NIST includes providing full legal name, tax identification number
      or social security number, routing number and bank account to which the prize
      money can be deposited directly.  <ul>    <li>If the prize is awarded to a minor
      as defined by section 3.1 of this document the prize shall be awarded to the
      minor’s parent/legal guardian, who must execute the required documentation on
      the minor’s behalf as a condition to the payment of any prize money.</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ol>'

description: '<strong><u>Background</u></strong>    Every few months it feels like
  there’s some new revolutionary thing that can be done with a smartphone, but smartphones
  are just one small part of the unprecedented advancements in our lives.  Combine
  things such as augmented reality displays with the vast amounts of information we’re
  collecting about our world, and you can help transform technology used by Public
  Safety and First Responders.  This Prize Challenge will help the PSCR (Public Safety
  Communications Research) team champion its mission and inspire the American public
  to make the world a safer place.    <strong><u>Project</u></strong><strong><u> Objectiv</u></strong><strong><u>es:</u></strong>    Your
  challenge with this project is to create a series of seven (7) Videos to explain
  "Open Innovation" and NIST’s "Public Safety Communications Research Open Innovation
  Accelerator" to the public.  The videos you create will be an invitation to people
  and companies across America to participate in crowdsourcing competitions with PSCR
  while describing the key public safety technology programs at PSCR. Your driving
  motivation should be to “<em>excite and inform!</em>” with the key guidelines of
  creating content that feels aspirational, futuristic and inclusive. Be innovative
  and think creatively to find ways of designing something unique. It’s also important
  to note that the individual Videos may require slightly different approaches, so
  pay close attention to each requirement.    <strong>For your <u>Concepts</u> and
  <u>Pitches</u></strong>, think about the method that will be used to communicate
  PSCR''s information, and the inspirational theme or creative presentation of information
  that might make it unique and engaging. Think about how the Videos might be structured,
  and how or who might deliver the message. Will you challenge the viewer, or try
  to pique their curiosity? Will you be flashy, or minimalistic and focused? Answer
  the questions, “What makes this relevant? What inspires action?”    <strong>Deliverables
