The Background

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are vital to understanding the complex needs of a patient. For this challenge, PRO data are defined as "any report of the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient, without interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or other medical expert." In other words, PRO data come from patient self-assessments and look beyond the clinical data to assess how a patient feels about his or her health.

The Problem
While PRO data have proven useful to healthcare providers, they are not widely used in clinical settings. Recently, some digital tools have been developed to streamline the collection of PRO data. However, those digital tools are not widely adopted due to challenges related to clinician workflow and patient ease with the tools.  Also, researchers who want to analyze PRO data across different practices or health systems often encounter the issue that data are not collected in a standardized manner. Creating a digital tool to efficiently collect, aggregate, and share PRO data is critical to advancing the quality of care.

Act Now
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Step Up App Challenge is seeking innovative technologists to develop user-friendly apps that collect standardized PRO data for clinical and research purposes.

Submit your app idea by September 24, 2018 for a chance to win the grand prize of up to $87,000! Register for the challenge today.

Frequently Asked Questions 

Submission Requirements
Overview of Phase 1 – Proposals

The proposal phase allows participants to present plans and frameworks that demonstrate how they plan to carry out the application development.

Overview of Phase 2 – Development

Phase 1 winners will advance to Phase 2 focused on developing the application using the FHIR technical specifications and PROMIS® resources provided by AHRQ. The application should have the capability to do CATs which requires the device to be connected with a server for real-time question calling and scoring (online administration). Participants can use the Assessment Center Application Programming Interface (API) to build an application that enables CAT. In addition to CAT, participants are highly encouraged to also include the capability to administer the selected PROMIS® short form v1.0 – Physical Function 10a (offline administration). Below are the references to PROMIS® API, CAT, and selected short form. A webinar on how to use the PROMIS® API will be held at the beginning of Phase 2.

Register for credentials to use the API: https://www.assessmentcenter.net/ac_api

Documentation on how to administer PROMIS® items using the API: https://www.assessmentcenter.net/ac_api/2012-01/Docs/API_tech_walkthrough.docx

The goal of Phase 2 is to present a viable application to collect standardized PRO data in ambulatory care settings including both primary care and specialty care practices. Participants need to demonstrate that the app could export standardized data which would facilitate future data integration into an EHR or IT system. Participants are required to undertake user testing of the application during Phase 2. Participants must provide evidence of testing with at least five people. A larger amount of time spent with each tester, greater formal rigor, and the number and diversity of people used for testing will result in a more positive assessment under the judging criteria. Evidence demonstrating user testing could include sample feedback, quotes, or pictures, and should include how it affected the development of the application.

 Phase 2 Submission Requirements

Submit by the deadline of February 15, 2019
Submit the application in a PDF format
Provide an implementation plan (up to 10 pages)
Describe key activities and resources required to deploy and pilot the application
Refine and incorporate relevant information from business case submission in Phase 1
Provide evidence of user testing including how it affected the application development (up to 5 pages)
Apps must incorporate the following usability, functionality, and technical requirements:
Computerized adaptive testing (CAT)
Adaptable to PRO domains other than physical functioning (e.g., pain, mental health)
Simple design, easy navigation, and intuitive to use
Personalized content
Not connected with any social media applications
HIPAA compliance if applicable
Device-based security
The PRO data must be encrypted at rest, even when the device is unlocked.
Follow specifications and current recommendations for AES-256 bit encryption
The key must be saved in the Keychain or SharedPreferences for iOS and Android respectively.
Authentication security
The application must be able to support token-based authentication including the standards of SAML and OAuth2.
The application must be capable of completing a onetime registration process with an external system leveraging two-factor authentication by creating an account with username and password, and a pin sent to the phone number provided during registration.
Data communication
Demonstrate the ability to represent the collected PRO data as both JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and Extensible Markup Language (XML)
Technical ability to do video demonstration of the application via live webinar to display the application’s device and data security, usability, accessibility, ease of data collection and HIPAA compliance if applicable

Overview of Phase 3 – Pilot Test

The final phase will involve pilot testing the application in “real-life” clinical settings. The grand prize winner in Phase 2 is required to collaborate with MedStar Health to pilot test the application in nine practice settings in the District/Maryland/Virginia area. If the grand prize winner cannot be at the pilot sites physically, MedStar could facilitate remote access for the collaboration. There will be a mix of primary care and specialty care practices. The goal of Phase 3 is to assess the usability of the application. This phase will also test the feasibility of implementation, the scalability of the application, and acceptance by stakeholders.

 Phase 3 Requirements
