<hr />
<p><strong><span style="color: #800080;">RAMP 2018 is coming</span></strong>:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nist.gov">NIST</a> is planning for the 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;Annual RAMP competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finalists of the competition will present at the <a href="http://energy.tamu.edu/events/2018-asme-international-manufacturing-science-engineering-conference/">International Manufacturing Science &amp; Engineering Conference (MSEC)</a> and the <a href="http://www.sme.org/namrc/">46th North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC)</a>. The co-located conferences will be hosted by <a href="https://www.tamu.edu">Texas A&amp;M University</a> from June 18-22, 2018, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Station,_Texas">College Station, Texas, USA</a>.</p>
<p>The upcoming competition will again build on ASTM standards for modeling manufacturing processes of the entrants choosing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis for the 2018 competition will be use process models to track resources and flows through the manufacturing system. We encourage student projects to consider using the competition as a focus for their work. Description below corresponds to the 2017 competition and is likely to change a bit. More details of the 2018 competition rules and entry process will come soon.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;">In the future, manufacturing will be planned out in the virtual world. How can we do this if we don't even have models for the basic processes such as welding, drilling, and forging? Sewing, assembly, or distillation? Nope, we don't even have models for those either! At least, not the types of models really needed for our high-tech world.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Manufacturers need models to improve operations, to protect the environment, to share information, and to compose them into systems. Using your models will let manufacturers simulate, improve, and optimize all sorts of processes.</p>
<p>Help us try out brand new standards created just for this purpose. Be the first to model your favorite processes, share your experiences, and maybe win some cash and honors! <a href="<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/document-library/simple-alarm-clock-3.png"</a> Want to hit us with novelty? While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rube Goldberg</a><sup>&dagger;</sup> may not be a winner in this challenge, your&nbsp; submission can be hilariously complex but simple is good too. We're truly at the starting line and basic models will be a tremendous help. Accuracy is important too but we expect initial models may sacrifice some accuracy in the interest of putting that initial stake in the ground. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/document-library/back-scratcher-3.png"</a> Not everyone can be an expert in all facets of manufacturing. You don't even need to be an expert. All you need is a good idea for one model expressed clearly - and to do that, of course standards are the way to go. We require&nbsp;that you use&nbsp;ASTM Standard Guide for Characterizing Environmental Aspects of Manufacturing Processes (ASTM E60.13 E3012-16). In addition, your entry will more likely win over our enthusiastic judges by using other standards as appropriate such as XML, JSON, or whatever your favorites are. Tell us how you applied them and why they made sense to use! <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ramp-reusable-abstractions-of-manufacturing-processes/clothing-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-159404"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-159404" src="https://www.challenge.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/clothing-3.png" alt="" width="464" height="550" /></a> Want to see an example?

### Rules 
{: .text-accent-warm-dark .font-heading-lg}

<p>The Official Rules are posted in the Federal Register and copied below for your convenience. In the unlikely event of a discrepancy, the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/19/2016-30437/announcement-of-requirements-and-registration-for-national-institute-of-standards-and-technology">Federal Register Notice</a> is the official documentation of the rules for the RAMP Challenge. At the time of Entry, participants must meet the following Eligibility Rules: To be eligible for a cash prize, the Official Representative (individual or team lead, in the case of a group project) must be age 18 at the time of entry and a U.S. citizen or permanent resident of the United States. In the case of a private entity, the business shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States or its territories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants may not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment. Eligibility excludes NIST employees and NIST Researcher Associates as well as direct recipients of NIST funding awards to collaborate on the development of the ASTM standard E3012-16. Non-NIST Federal employees acting in their personal capacities should consult with their respective agency ethics officials to determine whether their participation in this Competition is permissible.&nbsp; Employees of the NSF, the ASTM, and the ASME Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC) Conference Organizers are excluded from participating but members of these organizations are eligible to enter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other individuals or legal entities involved with the design, production, execution, distribution or evaluation of the RAMP Challenge are not eligible to participate. A Participant shall not be deemed ineligible because the Participant consulted with Federal employees or used Federal facilities in preparing its submission to the RAMP Challenge if the employees and facilities are made available to all Participants on an equitable basis. Multiple entries are permitted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Each entry will be reviewed independently. &nbsp;Multiple individuals and/or legal entities may collaborate as a group to submit a single entry, in which case a single individual must be designated as the official representative and must satisfy all of the eligibility requirements.&nbsp; That designated individual will be responsible for determining eligibility (covered above) and for meeting all entry and evaluation requirements. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The participants must register to participate and must comply with all 15 U.S.C. 3719 requirements. Participation is subject to all U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations.&nbsp; Individuals entering on behalf of or representing a company, institution or other legal entity are responsible for confirming that their entry does not violate any policies of that company, institution or legal entity.</p>
<p><strong>Entry Process for Participants</strong></p>
<p>As stated earlier, the RAMP Challenge calls on participants to model any manufacturing process for purposes of information sharing and sustainability assessment.&nbsp; The modeled process can be one that the submitter has uniquely studied, or from open literature or other 3<sup>rd</sup> party sources. To enter, the participant must create an account at challenge.gov and visit the Event Website, <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ramp-reusable-abstractions-of-manufacturing-processes/">https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ramp-reusable-abstractions-of-manufacturing-processes/</a>.</p>
<p>The participant must submit an analysis of a Unit Manufacturing Process that uses the ASTM E60.13 E3012-16 Standard Guide for Characterizing Environmental Aspects of Manufacturing Processes, and that meets the criteria described herein.</p>
<p>A complete Entry must be in pdf format and include your analysis (including any figures, tables, and references), the name and email address of the Participant who is officially representing the Entry, names of any additional team members and a team name (if applicable) that is chosen by the team members, and confirmation that you have read and agree to the Competition Rules contained in this Notice. Participants may provide submissions to the Event Website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Submissions can be made no later than 11:59&nbsp;PM ET on April 17, 2017, to the Event Website. Entries submitted before the start date and time, or after the end date and time, will not be evaluated or considered for award.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entries sent to NIST in any manner other than through the Event Website will not be evaluated or considered for award.&nbsp; Entries that do not comply with the formatting requirements set forth in this Notice will not be evaluated or considered for award. Entries must be complete, must not contain any confidential information and must be in English. In general, each Entry must:</p>
<ol>
<li>a) have all Participants agree to be governed by the Competition rules and only the single participant and official representative need to meet the eligibility requirements to win a prize under 15 USC 3719;</li>
<li>b) include an original model of the manufacturing process by application of ASTM E60.13 E3012-16 Standard Guide for Characterizing Environmental Aspects of Manufacturing Processes. Specifically, the Entry must include:</li>
<li>a project title page including project name, the name(s) of Participant(s), and the email address and phone number of the Participant who is officially representing the Entry,</li>
<li>a Unit Manufacturing Process (UMP) information model. A UMP is defined as the smallest element or sub-process in manufacturing that adds value through the modification or transformation of shape, structure, or property of input material or workpiece. Examples of a UMP are injection molding, die-casting and machining. A die-casting UMP can have individual operations such as die-preparation, clamping, injection, cooling, and ejection. A machining UMP can have multiple operations such as drilling, milling, or grinding.</li>
<li>a written narrative (fewer than 1500 words) describing how the Entry meets the Review Criteria described below in the Review Criteria section, and</li>
<li>an optional brief description of relevant case studies (fewer than 750 words) and/or a weblink (YouTube or Vimeo) to an original short (fewer than five minutes) video that describes the Entry. Participants must have permission to use all content in the video, including footage, music and images.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp; <em>Guidelines for UMP Representation to be Provided in the Entry</em> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants should choose any manufacturing process to demonstrate the application of a UMP representation using ASTM E60.13 E3012-16. ASTM is providing access to this standard free of charge for the purpose of the RAMP Challenge.</p>
<p>You can obtain a copy of the standard for use in the RAMP Challenge&nbsp;by emailing&nbsp;Stephen Mawn (<a href="mailto:smawn@astm.org">smawn@astm.org</a>).</p>
<p>The standard is further described in a Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering paper titled &ldquo;Standard representations for sustainability characterization of industrial processes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The paper may be downloaded from the NIST website: https://www.nist.gov/node/1090636). Examples of typical representations will be posted at the Event Website. For the identified UMP information model described in Section b-2 above, include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Graphical Representation: The four elements shown in the E3012-16 standard must be clearly identified in the graphical representation:
<ol>
<li>Inputs: Identify inputs. Create an example of inputs represented in a structured form such as JSON or XML.</li>
<li>Outputs: Identify outputs. Output must include 1 or more metrics, such as energy, cost, tear and wear, and CO2 emissions. Create an example of output represented in a structured form such as JSON or XML.</li>
<li>Product and Process Information: Identify the necessary product and process information that would be required to instantiate the transformation functions, such as CAD files, CAM files, technical drawings, and specifications sheets.</li>
<li>Resources: Identify specific manufacturing assets, such as machines, tools, and operators, that would be required to instantiate the transformation functions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Transformation Function: Describe a series of equations that compute the output from the input. The transformation function can be expressed in any readable mathematical format, such as using MS Word, LaTeX, ASCII text, or more formally in a language such as JSONiq or Matlab.</li>
<li>Nomenclature: Describe the nomenclature of the inputs/outputs represented in the structured form as well as the computed values in the transformation functions. This should include information such as names of the computed values, its meaning, type of the input variable, and the unit in which the data is represented in the model.</li>
<li>Validation: Explain how the model is validated. An example of validation includes procuring the data (i.e., inputs and outputs) from a physical (or virtual) manufacturing setting and validate this output against the computed output from the transformation function that is run with inputs from the real manufacturing setting. Compute the degree of error between the outputs from the model and the real manufacturing setting.&nbsp; Other approaches may be taken.</li>
<li>Novelty of UMP analysis: The main category is listed in bold type with various examples included for clarity.
<ol>
<li>Advancements to <strong>knowledge and understanding of UMP modeling</strong> through innovative and expressive representations and methodologies, novel formal representations, more accurate or specialized metric, metric representations that support cascading to higher production levels, or exploration of variations for families of UMP models.</li>
<li>Advancements to <strong>standards supporting reuse models</strong>. This may include automated methods that allow linking of UMP models into systems, facilitating system composition through naming conventions or other methods, generalization that unifies a collection of processes, or standards-based methods for integration with applications.</li>
<li>Advancement of <strong>techniques for development and validation of UMP models</strong>. This may include demonstration of validation techniques for the effectiveness and accuracy of the UMP models or techniques for producing useful derivatives of UMP models or creative methods for mining documentary model descriptions into formal representations.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Information sources: Source of the information used to define the UMP models, such as existing literature, industry case studies, and textbooks.</li>
<li>Multiple files may be submitted, but should be uploaded as a single file submission (.zip or .pdf.) A template formatted to capture entry requirements is provided on the Event Website for the submission.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>RAMP Challenge Award(s)</strong></p>
<p>The Prize Purse for the RAMP Challenge is a total of $3,250. The Prize Purse may increase, but will not decrease. Any increases in the Prize Purse will be posted on the Event Website and published in the <u>Federal Register</u>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prize Purse will be used to fund one or more awards. NIST will announce via the Event Website any Entry(ies) the finalists and those entries to which the Judges have made a cash award (each, an &ldquo;Award&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The anticipated number and amount of the Awards that will be awarded for this Competition is set forth in this <u>Federal Register</u> Notice; however, the Judges are not obligated to make all or any Awards, and reserve the right to award fewer than the anticipated number of Awards in the event an insufficient number of eligible Entries meet any one or more of the Judging Criteria for this Competition, based on the Judges' evaluation of the quality of Entries and in their sole discretion.&nbsp; Awards will be made based on the Judges&rsquo; evaluation of an Entry&rsquo;s compliance with the Judging Criteria for this Competition.</p>
<p>The designated official representative of all finalist entries will be notified in an email from NIST to the e-mail address provided in the submission document that they have been selected as a finalist. Finalists will be required to respond affirmatively and complete further documentation within 5 business days that they meet the eligibility criteria set forth in this notice and they (in the case of a team, one designated representative) are able to participate in person at the 2017 ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC) June 4-8, 2017, at the&nbsp;University of Southern California. Travel supplements to defray costs of travel and conference participation will be made available as needed. Return of any notification as &ldquo;undeliverable&rdquo; will result in disqualification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a finalist indicates they are unable to participate in the conference or does not respond within 5 business days, NIST reserves the right to invite the next highest ranked entrant (who is not already a finalist), as determined by the subject matter experts, to participate as a finalist. To win an Award, finalists must give a brief in-person presentation to the Judges during the MSEC conference in a special session dedicated to the RAMP Challenge.&nbsp; Winners will be determined by the Judging Panel at the MSEC Conference, and further verified by NIST. The winner verification process with NIST includes providing the full legal name, tax identification number or social security number, routing number and banking account to which the prize money can be deposited directly. Return of any notification as &ldquo;undeliverable&rdquo; will result in disqualification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After verification of eligibility, Awards will be distributed in the form of electronic funds transfer addressed to the official representative specified in the winning Entry.&nbsp; That official representative will have sole responsibility for further distribution of any Award among Participants in a group Entry or within a company or institution that has submitted an Entry through that representative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each list of Entries receiving Awards for the Competition will be made public according to the timeline outlined on the Event Website. Winners are responsible for all taxes and reporting related to any Award received as part of the Competition.</p>
<p>All costs incurred in the preparation of Competition Entries are to be borne by Participants.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation, Judging, and Selection of Winner(s)</strong></p>
<p><em>Submission Evaluation Criteria </em></p>
<p>This section discusses how Participant submissions will be evaluated.</p>
<p><em>Entry Submission and Review</em></p>
<p>The requirements for submission of a complete Entry are detailed in the section &ldquo;Entry Process for Participants.&rdquo; &nbsp;Each Entry will be reviewed by subject matter experts, who will assess how well the Entry addressed each of the following evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>For each Entry, subject matter experts will generate a numerical rating from 0 to 100 based on the five (5) equally weighted review criteria listed below. &nbsp;This rating will be supported by a brief narrative (fewer than 500 words) of the technical merits of the submission in terms of the review criteria. Subject matter experts will provide their individual assessments to the NIST Challenge Manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NIST Challenge Manager will identify the top eight submissions (&ldquo;finalist entries&rdquo;). The finalist entries and the accompanying subject matter expert evaluations, both the rating and narrative, will be provided to the Judging Panel for their deliberation.</p>
<p><em>Review Criteria</em> Subject matter experts will consider five equally weighted review criteria when evaluating submissions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Completeness: Submission follows the guidelines and includes all necessary components.&nbsp; All submissions must describe the approach taken to validate the work and provide both a graphical and formal representation of the UMP information model.&nbsp; An example will be posted on the competition website.</li>
<li>Complexity: Model reflects the complexities of the manufacturing process, especially those which influence sustainability indicators such as energy and material consumption.</li>
<li>Clarity: Model is clear in describing the process and the process-related information.</li>
<li>Accuracy: Submission accurately models the process as shown through validation.</li>
<li>Novelty: Approach taken develops new techniques to advance model reusability or reliability.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Judging Criteria</em></p>
<p>Eight finalist entries will be evaluated by the Judges in advance of and during the Finalist Presentations to take place at the 2017 ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference.&nbsp; NIST reserves the right to name fewer than eight finalists.</p>
<p>A panel of three (3) to five (5) judges will then be convened to rank the finalist entries and determine the winners. Judges will review each of the Entries and any corresponding technical assessments provided by subject matter experts.</p>
<p>Judges will participate in a session at the 2017 ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference where the finalists will give a 10-15 minute in-person presentation describing their submission and how well it meets the judging criteria. Time permitting, this will include a question and answer session after each presentation.</p>
<p>Judges will deliberate and then rank the finalist entries using the weighted Judging Criteria (percentage in parentheses):</p>
<ol>
<li>Complexity: Model reflects the complexities of the manufacturing process, especially those which influence sustainability indicators such as energy and material consumption. (10%)</li>
<li>Clarity: Model is clear in describing the process and the process-related information. (10%)</li>
<li>Accuracy: Submission accurately models the process as shown through validation. (35%)</li>
<li>Novelty: Approach taken develops new techniques to advance model reusability or reliability. (35%)</li>
<li>Presentation: Quality and content conveyed in a brief in-person presentation at the 2017 MESC Conference. (10%)</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Awards </em> First, Second, and Third Place Prizes, and up to five runners-up, will be selected by the Judges.</p>
<ul>
<li>First Place Prize is $1,000</li>
<li>Second Place Prize is $750</li>
<li>Third Place Prize is $500</li>
<li>Runners Up Prize is $200</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Subject Matter Experts and Judging Panel</em></p>
<p>Subject Matter Experts, to be selected by the NIST with assistance from Challenge supporters, will, as a body, represent a high degree of experience with manufacturing processes, process modeling, and sustainability assessment of manufacturing processes, and a balance of perspectives from relevant manufacturing sectors.</p>
<p>Subject Matter Experts may consist of NIST Federal Employees, NIST Associates, employees of RAMP Challenge supporters, or their representatives. Subject Matter Experts will not select winners of any awards. The NIST Director will appoint a panel of highly qualified Judges.</p>
<p>The Judging Panel will consist of individuals who are experts in the field of sustainability of manufacturing processes. Judges will deliberate and rank finalist entries according to the Judging Criteria described above. The top (up to eight) Entries ranked by the Judges will be selected to receive an Award. Judges may not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of, any entity that is a registered Participant in this Competition and may not have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a registered Participant.</p>
<p>In the event of such a conflict, a Judge must recuse himself or herself. Should this occur a new Judge may be appointed to the panel.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>By participating in the RAMP Challenge, you agree to assume any and all risks and to release, indemnify and hold harmless NIST or any supporting agency or entity &nbsp;from and against any injuries, losses, damages, claims, actions and any liability of any kind (including attorneys&rsquo; fees) resulting from or arising out of your participation in, association with or submission to the RAMP Challenge (including any claims alleging that your Entry infringes, misappropriates or violates any third party&rsquo;s intellectual property rights). &nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, you agree to waive claims against the Federal Government and its related entities, except in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue, or profits, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising from your participation in the RAMP Challenge, whether the injury, death, damage, or loss arises through negligence or otherwise.</p>
<p>NIST is not responsible for any miscommunications such as technical failures related to computer, telephone, cable, and unavailable network or server connections, related technical failures, or other failures related to hardware, software or virus, or incomplete or late Entries. &nbsp;Any compromise to the fair and proper conduct of the RAMP Challenge may result in the disqualification of an Entry or Participant, termination of the RAMP Challenge, or other remedial action, at the sole discretion of NIST. &nbsp;NIST reserves the right in its sole discretion to extend or modify the dates of the RAMP Challenge, and to change the terms set forth herein governing any phases taking place after the effective date of any such change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>By entering, you agree to the terms set forth herein and to all decisions of NIST and/or all of their respective agents, which are final and binding in all respects.</p>
<p>NIST is not responsible for: &nbsp;(1) Any incorrect or inaccurate information, whether caused by a Participant, printing errors, or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or used in the RAMP Challenge; (2) unauthorized human intervention in any part of the Entry Process for the RAMP Challenge; (3) technical or human error that may occur in the administration of the RAMP Challenge or the processing of Entries; or (4) any injury or damage to persons or property that may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from a Participant&rsquo;s participation in the RAMP Challenge or receipt or use or misuse of an Award. &nbsp;If for any reason an Entry is confirmed to have been deleted erroneously, lost, or otherwise destroyed or corrupted, the Participant&rsquo;s sole remedy is to submit another Entry in the RAMP Challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Termination and Disqualification</strong></p>
<p>NIST reserves the authority to cancel, suspend, and/or modify the RAMP Challenge, or any part of it, if any fraud, technical failures, or any other factor beyond NIST&rsquo;s reasonable control impairs the integrity or proper functioning of the RAMP Challenge, as determined by NIST in its sole discretion. NIST reserves the right to disqualify any Participant or Participant team it believes to be tampering with the Entry process or the operation of the RAMP Challenge or to be acting in violation of any applicable rule or condition.</p>
<p>Any attempt by any person to undermine the legitimate operation of the RAMP Challenge may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, NIST reserves the authority to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<p><strong>Verification of Potential Winner(s)</strong></p>
<p>All potential winners are subject to verification by NIST, whose decisions are final and binding in all matters related to the RAMP Challenge. Potential winner(s) must continue to comply with all terms and conditions of the RAMP Challenge Rules described in this notice, and winning is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements. &nbsp;In the event that a potential winner, or an announced winner, is found to be ineligible or is disqualified for any reason, NIST may make an award, instead, to another Participant.</p>
