        <h3>Showcase and Ideas Exchange for Bias in Healthcare AI</h3>
        <p class="card-text text-center">The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will be announcing the winners of the bias detection challenge in this virtual event. </p>

<p class="card-text text-center">The Bias Detection Tools for Clinical Decision Making Challenge launched in October to award up to $700,000 to those teams best able to make an open-source solution that detects and mitigates bias in AI/ML models used in healthcare settings. Over 200 individuals registered to compete in this Challenge, and the resources/webinars provided during the course of the Challenge aimed to provide context and cross-training for a complex issue that encompasses AI/ML, healthcare and bias/ethics. </p>

<p class="card-text text-center">Attendees will learn from challengers about issues surfaced and discoveries made while developing their solutions; share thoughts and ideas with NCATS on how next to help propel the field of bias detection and mitigation in healthcare AI forward; and discover how you can participate in future efforts to improve healthcare and mitigate bias through AI. </p>
