<h3>About Challenge.Gov</h3>
<details>
  <summary><em><b>What is Challenge.Gov?</b></em></summary>
  <br>
  <p>Challenge.Gov, managed by Technology Transformation Services (TTS), within the General Services Administration, is the official hub for prize competitions across the U.S. federal government.
Through this platform, federal agencies engage public solvers in prize competitions and crowdsourcing campaigns to identify innovative solutions to important issues.</p>

  <summary><em><b>What is a prize competition?</b></em></summary>
  <br>
  <p>A prize competition (also referred to as a “challenge,” "prize challenge," "competition," "incentive
prize" or any combination thereof) is a way for federal agencies to crowdsource and engage public
    innovators directly to find interesting ideas or solutions to important problems.</p>
<p>Since 2010, the U.S. government has run over 1,600 prize competitions - engaging public solvers
ranging from students and hobbyists to small business owners and academic researchers.
Longitude and ship navigation, Lindbergh’s transatlantic flight, even initial designs for the U.S.
Capitol and White House—all were the result of open prize competitions. Even those self-driving
  vehicles got their start in federal prize competitions too!</p>
<p>More recently, challenges have produced concepts for the next “lunar loo” (space toilet), an
improved digital wallet user interface, protecting fish from water infrastructure, opioid detection in
international mail, and “getting out the count” for the census.</p>
