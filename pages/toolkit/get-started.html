                                        <p>Every challenge goes through the five phases in the order they're presented
                                            here; each phase is
                                            composed of three to eight substeps that do not necessarily need to be
                                            completed in the order
                                            presented. The substeps contain several sections—in the main column you will
                                            find a description of
                                            the substep, and below it expandable Key Takeaways that answer common
                                            questions or detail best
                                            practices. In the column to the right are links to the other substeps within
                                            the phase.</p>
                                        <p>Below those links are resources recommended by the challenge community. These
                                            take many
                                            forms—video tutorials, downloadable templates, examples of documents and
                                            slide deck pitches among
                                            them—that will help you at every step in the process.</p>
                                        <p>The Project Timeline lists all the phases and their substeps in one
                                            convenient place and allows
                                            you to mark each step as completed as you progress through your
                                            challenge.</p>
