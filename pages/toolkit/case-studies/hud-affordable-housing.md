<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The need for quality affordable housing has never been
greater. At its best, housing can help strengthen the social
and physical fabric of communities and neighborhoods. It is
the hope of HUD and its office of Policy Development and
Research (PD&amp;R) that by initiating and funding this
competition, a new generation will advance the design and
production of livable and sustainable housing for low- and
moderate-income people through research and innovation.</p>

<p>PD&amp;R worked with the Office of Public and Indian Housing
to issue a call for interested public housing authorities.
The housing authorities were evaluated on a first-come,
first-serve basis. For the inaugural 2014 competition, HUD
partnered with the Housing Authority of Bergen County (HABC)
in New Jersey.</p>
<p>HABC offered a challenging project for the competitionâ€”an
historic American Legion building situated on 1.5 acres.
HABC wished to maintain this historic building while
providing affordable housing for homeless veterans.
Challenge participants needed to consider design, community
development and financing elements in order to provide an
all-encompassing solution that would allow HABC to meet its
goal. They also needed to understand the needs of the
intended residents, the zoning restrictions and leveraging
opportunities. The types of solutions sought through the
competition were ideas and visualizations related to
architecture, landscape architecture, planning, urban design
and real estate finance.</p>
<p>The total cash prize for the 2014 Innovation in Affordable
Housing challenge was $15,000. Non-monetary incentives were
also used to motivate participants. Finalists were invited
to travel to Washington, DC (two members of each team
received travel funds) and present in front of a panel of
esteemed experts in the field of architecture, affordable
housing and community development. This was an excellent
development opportunity for the finalists as they entered
the job market.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The competition succeeded in introducing the next generation
of architects, planners and others to the important and
expansive nature of affordable housing. The competition
received 7 submissions from teams that were composed of
graduate students from a wide range of disciplines. Each
team had to include three to five students and at least one
had to be from a non-design background. Examples of eligible
disciplines include architecture, urban planning, law,
public policy, business, finance, real estate, and
engineering. The runner-up, which received $5,000, was a
joint team from New York University and Columbia University.
The winning team, which received $10,000, was from Ohio
State University. HUD decided to run the challenge again in
2015.</p>
<p>The acting Executive Director of HABC attended the final
presentations, and many staff members viewed it via webcast.
The ideas presented by finalists are being kept in mind as
HABC works with architects and developers on the site.</p>
<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Judge Submissions and
Select Winners"</strong></p>
<p>HUD recruited a jury of five experts in the field of
architecture, affordable housing, and community development.
The jury was asked to evaluate the proposals on three main
factors: environmental, financial, and social. Each main
factor contained seven to eight sub factors. The jurors were
also encouraged to look for innovation throughout the
proposal. In the future, HUD will designate a head juror who
can guide the process.</p>
<p>The competition ran in two phases:</p>
<p><em>Phase I</em></p>
<p>Multidisciplinary teams of graduate students submitted their
first-round electronic proposals. A schematic design level
site plan and other details were required. The evaluation
criteria emphasized understanding of and provision for
community services, planning context (including zoning) and
economic considerations related to affordable housing
development, as well as design. The submissions were to
include a narrative of two to four pages and two electronic
design boards.</p>
<p>The panel of jurors evaluated all submissions and chose four
finalist teams to move on to Phase II of the
competition.</p>
<p><em>Phase II</em></p>
<p>Finalists were challenged to further refine their solutions,
incorporating more detail, developed floor plans and
analyses (economic, energy, etc.). The finalists traveled to
the site for a walk-through and meeting with HABC staff. The
site visit offered finalists the opportunity to examine the
site first hand and speak with local officials and community
members.</p>
<p>The final jury and award ceremony was held on May 6, 2014 at
HUD headquarters in Washington, DC. Student finalist teams
each prepared a 15-minute presentation and two design
boards. They presented in front of a live audience, a
webcast audience and the panel of jurors. After all the
finalists presented, the jurors deliberated and former HUD
Secretary Shaun Donovan announced the winners.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Announce
Winners"</strong></p>
<p>A webpage dedicated to the competition was created on
HUDuser.org. An initial announcement of the competition was
sent to PD&amp;R's listserv and recipients could sign up on
the webpage to receive further competition updates.
Throughout the recruitment phase, information was sent to
these self-selected individuals. HUD also hired a contractor
to help with the competition and aid in solicitation and
outreach.</p>
<p>Both before the registration deadline and during the
competition, blogs were posted on the HUDdle to keep the
general public and the potential student participants
informed. Articles covering the competition site visit and
the final awards ceremony were included in the Edge, PD&amp;R's
online magazine. HUD also issued press releases announcing
the finalists, and later the winners.</p>
<p>The competition team learned that more outreach to graduate
schools was needed in future years, because some students
claimed they did not know about IAH until after registration
closed. In addition, the schedule was revised for the second
annual competition in 2015 to better accommodate academic
schedules.</p>
<h2>Challenge Type</h2>
<p><strong>Ideas</strong></p>
<p>The overall goal of the HUD 2014 Innovation in Affordable
Housing challenge is to foster innovative problem solving
and solutions.&nbsp; The challenge also endeavors to promote
an interdisciplinary, team-work way of problem solving and
generating ideas that is not the typical academic approach
to looking at a problem in this topic area.&nbsp; In order
to promote creative thinking and innovative ideation, the
challenge required teams consist of students with different
backgrounds.&nbsp; This creates a real-world approach for
students to solve development problems and promotes new and
creative ideas by encouraging competitors to partner with
experts in diverse disciplines.&nbsp; It promotes a form of
collaboration that results in new innovations and
outside-the-box thinking.&nbsp; Some of the ideas generated
in this ideation challenge included physical, financial, and
social solutions for affordable housing for veterans in
Bergen County, New Jersey.</p>
<p>The structure of this challenge also encouraged the
development of creative ideas by using a two-phase
organization. In the first phase, teams were encouraged to
focus on the ideation element of the challenge. This allowed
competitors to focus on the design of their solutions. Those
who advanced to the next phase were able to further refine
their ideas and include more detail, as well as economic and
environmental analyses. This iterative approach to judging
and challenge structure can be useful when a problem is best
addressed by both creative thinking and the careful
implementation of new ideas.</p>
