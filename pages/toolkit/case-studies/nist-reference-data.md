<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Reference Data Challenge was a call to action for app
developers to help improve the way NIST shares scientific
reference data. Scientists and engineers need data—from the
atomic weight of carbon and the structure of benzene to the
most precise value for the speed of light. High quality
physical and chemical reference data help researchers design
experiments, build better products, solve health and
environmental problems and even study the stars. NIST
provides some of the most accurate and comprehensive
datasets in the world, known as standard reference data
(SRD). In this challenge, entrants created an app that used
one (or more) of six popular SRD. A panel of
judges—including internet pioneer Vint Cerf and the
Department of Commerce Chief Data Officer Ian Kalin—selected
the winning apps based on the apps' potential impact,
creativity and innovation, implementation and use of
SRD.</p>
<p>The challenge ran over a two-month period and was hosted on
the Devpost website. A total of $45,000 in prizes was
offered, with first place receiving $30,000, second place
$10,000 and third place $5,000.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>As a result of the challenge, 25 new apps were created using
NIST reference data, helping to initiate a modernization of
NIST's publically accessible data. Over 130 participants
registered on the site, building interest in NIST reference
data. The contest also stimulated the growth of at least one
new company: the first place winner, Meru Apps LLC, intends
to develop products that will help laboratory scientists use
data more effectively.</p>

<p>The top prize of $30,000 went to Kris Reyes from Meru Apps in
Princeton, N.J. His app, Meru Lab Reference, allows users to
quickly access NIST chemical species data with the tap of a
near-field communication (NFC) tag, a smart chip that is
able to store digital information and share it with a
smartphone. The second place prize of $10,000 went to
college students Zachary Ratliff from Waco, Texas, and
Daniel Graham from Danville, Ky., for their Lab Pal app that
is a "go-to" tool for scientists and engineers. The third
place award of $5,000 went to a team from MetroStar Systems
in Reston, Va., whose app, ChemBook, provides multimedia
information about chemical elements from NIST and other
sources. Honorable mention awards (no cash prize) went to
Andy Hall's SciCalc9000 app, a scientific calculator that
integrates NIST SRD, and Annie Hui and Neil Wood of R-Star
Technology Solutions, whose Thermocouple Calibrator app is a
handy tool for converting between voltage and temperature.
This challenge kicked off a bigger NIST open data commitment
to improve the accessibility of SRD for app developers and
other users of this valuable scientific data.</p>
<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Estimate Budget and
Resources"</strong></p>
<p>NIST personnel were involved in the design and execution of
the Reference Data Challenge. In addition to a significant
amount of the challenge manager's (a NIST employee) time,
staff in the NIST Office of Information and Systems
Management (OISM) were employed to generate machine readable
(JSON) data files. NIST research and technical staff were
consulted to help identify and prepare the data. NIST's
Office of the Chief Counsel also dedicated time for scoping
and finalizing the challenge rules and associated
documentation per America COMPETES Act requirements. The
challenge was hosted on a website provided by Devpost
(formerly Challengepost). The prize funds, challenge website
hosting and OISM time were billed to an account established
for the purpose of the challenge. Other staff time was
provided in kind or as part of established responsibilities.&nbsp;
In total, executing the challenge used approximately
one-fifth FTE (challenge manager) and two FTEs at 10 percent
effort, and $37,500 for IT services (data preparation and
challenge website).</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Develop Terms and
Conditions"</strong></p>
<p>The NIST challenge manager coordinated closely with NIST's
Office of the Chief Counsel to develop a comprehensive set
of rules that provided clarity to participants about the
requirements and expectations for their engagement in the
challenge, while maintaining compliance with requirements
stipulated under the America COMPETES Act authority. The
terms and conditions (or rules, in this case) were developed
with the goals of the challenge in mind: to increase
awareness of important NIST scientific data resources and to
stimulate innovative uses of NIST data as part of a larger
open data commitment. Below are some aspects to NIST's
development of the challenge rules, which were posted in a
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/07/22/2015-17865/announcement-of-requirements-and-registration-for-national-institute-of-standards-and-technology">notice
in the Federal Register</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> This competition was open
to all individuals over the age of 18 that are residents
of one of the 50 United States, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam,
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or
American Samoa; and to for-profit or nonprofit
corporations, institutions or other validly formed legal
entities organized or incorporated in, and which
maintain a primary place of business in, any of the
preceding jurisdictions. An individual, whether
participating singly or with a group, was required to be
a citizen or permanent resident of the United States.
</li>
<li><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> NIST did not
make any claim to ownership of entries, consistent with
the challenge goal of stimulating innovative app
solutions by individuals outside of NIST.
</li>
<li><strong>Minimum Criteria:</strong> The rules provided a
list of minimum criteria for consideration for a prize.
While some of these were stipulated by the legal
authority used (e.g., no use of NIST or Department of
Commerce logos), additional criteria were added to
support robust, complete apps. For example, the
integrity and acknowledgement of NIST data was an
important aspect of apps resulting from this challenge.
Therefore, one criterion stipulated that the app include
a statement that "This product uses data provided by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
but is not endorsed or certified by NIST," and that the
NIST standard reference data numbers be displayed
prominently.
</li>
<li><strong>Freely Available Data:</strong> NIST required
that each submission use at least one of six required
datasets posted on the NIST website and on data.gov. The
rules allowed for the addition of other freely available
datasets that enhanced the usefulness of the app for
other users. In this competition, there were no
requirements for open source solutions.
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #3: "Pay Winners"</strong></p>
<p>Upon determination of the three winners by the judging panel,
the challenge manager immediately informed the winners that
they were being considered for a prize. To claim the prize,
they were required to complete a winner verification form,
which verified their eligibility and confirmed they were
qualified to participate in the challenge. Upon receipt of
this completed form, NIST initiated payment processing in a
timely manner in line with the public announcement of the
winners.</p>
<h2>Challenge Type</h2>
<p><strong>Software</strong></p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>
<p>This app challenge required solvers to use one (or more) of
six valuable NIST scientific datasets, helping to promote
awareness and use of NIST reference data. The first place
winner started a company and is developing his app for wide
use by scientists and engineers.</p>
<h2>Legal Authority</h2>
