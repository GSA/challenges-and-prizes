<p style="font-size: x-large;">The Asteroid Data Hunter Challenge was the first open innovation project in support of a NASA grand challenge to find all asteroid threats to human populations and determine what to do about them. This inaugural challenge led to development of software accessible enough that citizen scientists, hobbyist astronomers, and even professional organizations/institutions could download and use it.

<h2>Background</h2>
<!--Body Content Start-->
<p>The Asteroid Data Hunter Challenge was the first open innovation project to be conducted in support of NASA's Asteroid Grand Challenge: To find all asteroid threats to human populations and determine what to do about them. The results of the Asteroid Data Hunter Challenge were originally intended to provide new algorithms to increase the ability to detect asteroids from imagery captured by ground-based telescopes, such as the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS).</p>
<p>NASA partnered with Planetary Resources, Inc., (PRI) to launch a series of contests that made up the overall challenge using TopCoder, available through NASA&rsquo;s contract with Harvard University, to develop a more computationally efficient, general purpose algorithm to detect moving objects using CSS data&mdash;specifically, to increase the detection sensitivity, minimize the number of false positives, ignore imperfections in the data, and ensure that the algorithm can run effectively on all computers.</p>
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Given the success of the initial algorithm contest, the outcome for the overall challenge evolved to include the development of a software application that is so easy to use that citizen scientists, hobbyist astronomers, and even professional organizations/institutions will want to download it. Thus, the challenge sought to provide both scientific value to the asteroid detection community and a tool for citizen scientists to use to help with asteroid detection.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>This challenge was announced at the 2014 South by Southwest Interactive Festival in Austin, Texas. It received significant press coverage, which brought new competitors to the TopCoder community. Throughout the 10 months of the challenge, over 1,200 solvers participated and submitted 700 solutions that resulted in the development of both a new algorithm and a software package.</p>
<p>The algorithm demonstrated a 15-percent improvement over the current method of identifying asteroids in the main belt of asteroids that orbit between Mars and Jupiter and also represents a real opportunity to identify more asteroids in the CSS data. The software was officially released at the 2015 South by Southwest Interactive festival and provides amateur astronomers with access to a new tool in the asteroid-hunting arsenal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beauty of such archives is that the data doesn't grow stale, and with novel approaches, techniques and algorithms, they can be harvested for new information. The participants of the Asteroid Data Hunter Challenge did just that, probing observations of the night sky for new asteroids that might have slipped through the software cracks the first time the images were analyzed,&rdquo; said Jose Luis Galache of the Minor Planet Center. &ldquo;Moreover, this software can now be used to analyze new images and is available to any observer who wants to use it. The Minor Planet Center applauds these efforts to provide superior tools to all, and looks forward to receiving new asteroid observations generated with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The results of this challenge continue to support the use of crowdsourced algorithms to advance NASA's image-processing capabilities and the continued use of open innovation. Furthermore, these results were obtained for a total project cost of less than $200,000, which is less than the salary for one full-time engineer for the same time period. The software is open source and continued to be maintained by PRI after the challenge.&nbsp; It already had been downloaded to more than 8,000 amateur users by March 2016.</p>

<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Building a Team</strong></p>
<p>NASA&rsquo;s Center of Excellence for Collaborative Innovation (CoECI) assigns a team member to every challenge launched by one of its crowdsourcing contractors. The CoECI team member serves as the individual responsible for ensuring that a challenge owner has clear expectations and understands their responsibilities to ensure successful challenge execution by the contractor.</p>
<p>The CoECI challenge coordinator also ensures that the contractor responsible for executing the challenge understands the needs and expectations of the organization that owns the challenge. The challenge coordinator essentially functions in a role similar to that of a contracting officer&rsquo;s representative, serving as the intermediary between the government requirements and the crowdsourcing contractor&rsquo;s ability to meet those requirements through application of a particular method of crowdsourcing.</p>
<p>Additionally, roles and responsibilities were defined up front as this challenge involved several concerned participants and stakeholders from NASA and its partners at the Minor Planet Center, PRI, Harvard, and TopCoder. This included an executive steering committee and a technical execution team. While TopCoder was responsible for full execution of the challenge, PRI undertook custodianship of the data under a NASA Space Act Agreement and interacted with the Minor Planet Center. PRI also was instrumental as a technical expert along with NASA and NASA&rsquo;s representative from the Minor Planet Center. Harvard provided contest scoring metrics, and analysis of resulting algorithms.</p>
<p>Those roles were facilitated through an agreed-to status and internal communication plan that was facilitated by the use of TopCoder&rsquo;s instance of Basecamp. Those individuals responsible for technical execution were able to move quickly and with agility while any decisions associated with scope change and cost were brought to the attention of the executive committee. The TopCoder Project Manager and the CoECI Challenge Coordinator worked closely together to facilitate a rapid decision-making process.</p>

<p><strong>Executing the Communications Plan</strong></p>
<p>As with any challenge, the Asteroid Data Hunter communication plan was an essential part of the effective execution of this challenge, particularly given the attention it was receiving through various media outlets. As part of the overall team roles and responsibilities, specific attention was paid to ensuring clear roles and responsibilities associated with external communication for each of the parties involved in the execution of the challenge. Again, this helped to ensure as efficient and effective execution of the communication plan as possible.</p>
<p>The plan also clearly identified the specific products to be produced (e.g., press releases, social media channels) and a schedule for release of those products. Developing an agreed-to hashtag name for social media products provided a significant benefit in coordinating social media efforts from the three parties. All team members had access to the plan in the Basecamp instance set up to support project execution.</p>

<p><strong>Announcing Winners</strong></p>
<p>For challenges executed on the TopCoder platform, focus on the winners is not typically an expected outcome. As a result, focus instead is on the outcome and results of the challenge itself. The ability to announce the launch at the 2014 South by Southwest Festival and return the next year to announce and demonstrate the tangible results of that effort was a considerable boon to the attention brought to the success of this effort. It resulted in coverage in such diverse media outlets as wired.com, govexec.com, theguardian.com, and bbc.co.uk. The Weather Channel also picked up the story and actually modified the video to appeal to its audience during a feature section.</p>

<p><strong>Managing Solutions</strong></p>
<p>This challenge evolved from having an intended outcome of a new open-source algorithm to include the integration of that improved algorithm into a software application easily downloadable to almost any home computer. Once the potential for the successful use of the new application became apparent, PRI acknowledged that it would assume responsibility for maintaining the code. Please note that maintenance of this open-source code was not resource intensive but did provide users a responsible party who could answer questions and continue to monitor the use of the software.</p>
<p>NASA initially provided an easily accessible GitHub site as repository for the open-source code.&nbsp; All the original code is within this GitHub instance. It is maintained by PRI, and the source code is posted there under an Apache 2.0 license.&nbsp; All products from the competition are still available through the NASA GitHub instance. PRI, however, maintains a SourceForge instance where the Mac/Windows/Linus installers&mdash;plus the test data and user guide&mdash;are kept to enable any user access to data to practice with the app. This is maintained by PRI as well.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p><strong>Be clear with partners about who does what when it comes to outreach.</strong></p>
<p>This challenge worked because all stakeholders were on the same page regarding goals, and project management responsibilities were well defined. This carried over to the communications plan. Still, it wasn&rsquo;t crystal clear to PRI from the onset that NASA would be taking the lead on outreach. Once this was cleared up, PRI took on the role of amplifying NASA&rsquo;s communications. This proved critical to the success of the challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Be open and willing to go where your innovators take you.</strong></p>
<p>This project was initiated purely as an algorithm-improvement challenge. It wasn&rsquo;t until it was clear the improvement was going to be significant that the idea was born to use that algorithm as part of a software application that could be used by citizen scientists. Given how well the NASA, PRI, and Topcoder personnel were working together, the second phase fell into place quickly and easily once funding was secured.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a lesson learned as much as a confirmation of the benefits of open innovation. In this case, NASA and its partners adapted based on initial results, and the project morphed into something with even greater reach and utility.</p>

<h2>Challenge Type: Software and Apps, Analytics, Visualizations, and Algorithms (AVA)</h2>
<p>NASA, in partnership with PRI, launched the Asteroid Data Hunter challenge in 2014-2015 to improve the algorithms for image processing of telescopic space imagery to detect asteroids. This challenge was conducted by TopCoder through NASA&rsquo;s contract with Harvard University.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge had over $70,000 in prizes and resulted in an algorithm that was determined to be 15 percent better than current methods in locating asteroids in the main belt. Additionally, the project built the algorithm into a multiplatform downloadable app for use by amateur astronomers.</p>
<p>Given the data set that was available through partnership with PRI, and NASA and PRI&rsquo;s interest in more efficiently sifting through the available data, this was the perfect problem to address with an algorithm challenge. NASA had been experimenting with image-processing algorithms prior to this effort, and that previous experience benefitted the challenge. Also, once the successful algorithm results were known, there was an added goal of making sure that capability could be placed in the hands of both amateurs and professionals.</p>
<p>This is a good example of a problem aptly suited to an algorithm challenge that evolved into an effort to develop an app that was easy to use. The expertise and effort already underway for the algorithm challenge became the perfect scenario for a follow-on software development challenge. Thus, what started as a challenge to generate a specialized scientific tool resulted in a solid application that supports the use of citizen science to support scientific discovery.</p>
