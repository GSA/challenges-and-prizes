<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The expansion of ultra-high speed (UHS) networks offers the
opportunity to revolutionize the way services and
information are delivered for criminal justice and other
public safety applications. UHS applications ("apps') now
have the potential to provide ubiquitous, real-time,
individually tailored information and decision-support
functions to criminal justice and public safety
practitioners in rapidly evolving emergencies. Additionally,
the increased capacity of UHS systems now makes it possible
to merge and manipulate data allowing the development and
use of powerful analytical and management tools.</p>

<p>Through this challenge, NIJ sought to encourage the
development, use, and evaluation of UHS apps that are
capable of improving criminal justice and public
safety-service delivery efficiency and/or effectiveness; and
to develop models for measuring and quantifying the specific
impact of these apps. Contestants were required to submit a
working prototype of the software and corresponding
apps.</p>
<p>All submissions were required to demonstrate a need for the
app; articulate the manner in which the app would improve
criminal justice effectiveness and/or efficiency; specify
the public access databases used to support the app and the
proposed method of acquiring and updating these data; and
identify appropriate and obtainable impact measures.</p>
<p>Submissions were accepted in two phases. During Phase I,
contestants submitted prospectus papers outlining the ideas
for their apps. Submissions from contestants that were
selected to move on to Phase II included short videos that
described and demonstrated their app prototypes. A total
prize purse of $150,000 was offered.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>NIJ received 15 papers in Phase I. Five contestants were
selected to compete in Phase II. Phase II submissions
demonstrated the potential to improve, measurably services
and operations in areas such as school safety, crime
mapping, video technology, and data streaming. The first,
second, and third place winners were announced in July
2015.</p>
<p>The first place winner, the City of Ammon, Idaho, received
$75,000 for their School Emergency Screencast Application.&nbsp;
This app works with a school's existing camera systems, UHS
network, and gunshot detection hardware to report gunshots
within a school to first responders in real time.</p>
<p>The second place team, the City of Torrance, California
received $50,000 for their UHS Mapping Application.&nbsp;
That app empowers individual businesses, schools, and other
building owners to share their location and other data, such
as maps, floor plans, parking structures, videos, and
dangerous chemicals lists with first responders.</p>
<p>The third place team, Forensic Logic, Inc., received $25,000
for their LEAP Network Video Application.&nbsp; That app
connects public closed-circuit television (CCTV) with law
enforcement records and open-source geographic information
system (GIS) platforms.</p>
<p>The NIJ Ultra-High Speed Apps Challenge was one of the first
Challenges launched by NIJ and the Department of Justice.
The developers created a close-knit team to launch the
Challenge.&nbsp; The Team included staff from the Office of
Justice Programs' (OJP) Office of the Chief Information
Officer (OJP OCIO), Office of the Chief Financial Officer
(OJP OCFO), Office of Communications (OJP OCOM), Office of
the General Counsel (OJP OGC); and NIJ's Offices of Research
and Evaluation (NIJ ORE) and Science and Technology (NIJ
OST). &nbsp;NIJ is an OJP component.</p>
<p>A unique innovation adopted for this Challenge was the
requirement for the contestants to submit short videos with
their Phase II submissions that explained their solutions.&nbsp;
The judges found the videos immensely helpful in explaining
the value, purpose and intended operation of the app.</p>
<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Estimate Budget and
Resources"</strong></p>
<p>The tiered prize structure was intended to provide incentive
for applicants to develop "the best solution" rather than
just "a solution." The prize purse was determined through
consultation with industry and government experts familiar
with this area of research, along with agency legal and
budget staff. The ideal prize amount and structure was
considered one, which would draw a broad, diverse pool of
applicants with the background and skills necessary to
develop competitive and compelling proposals, which not only
provided viable solutions in the short term â€“ but also
served as a starting point for additional problem solving
and app development. Challenge prize money came from the
agency's operational budget used to support extramural
research, development, and evaluation grants.</p>
<p>As both a cost-saving and risk reduction measure, NIJ uses a
streamlined version of OJP's existing grant making systems
and processes to process Challenges.&nbsp; Agency science
and management staff were responsible for all activities
related to the Challenge, with some limited support from
agency contract staff for activities such as application
review and other related work.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Define Evaluation and
judging Process"</strong></p>
<p>A distinguished panel of individuals with expertise in one or
more of the following areas: criminal justice, public
management, application development, emergency management,
and network management judged submissions to this Challenge
through a consensus process. Their recommendations were
advisory. The NIJ Director made final award
determinations.</p>
<p>To ensure both equity in judging and the receipt of high
quality submissions, the Challenge announcement specified
the elements to be addressed in the submissions.&nbsp; It
also included well-defined, weighted criteria against which
submissions were judged. These criteria were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contribution of the application towards improving the
    effectiveness and/or efficiency of criminal justice
    services (60 percent);
</li>
<li>Ease of implementing the application by state and local
    criminal justice agencies, including considerations of
    platform, and time and cost requirements (15 percent);
</li>
<li>Practicality of dataset selection in terms of relevance,
    ease of acquisition, and ongoing access (15 percent);
    and,
</li>
<li>Feasibility of evaluation methodology and impact
    measurement (10 percent).
</li>
</ul>
<p>These criteria were embedded in the on-line Peer Review
Module of the OJP Grants Management System, used by the
judges to record their individual and consensus evaluation
scores and narratives.</p>
<p>During the judging process, the evaluators discussed the
submissions based on individual scores and participated in
consensus meetings to make informed recommendations. During
Phase I, the consensus meeting was conducted through an NIJ
moderated teleconferences.&nbsp; For Phase II, the judges
were brought together for a full day, face-to-face
meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #3: "Complete Required
Reports"</strong></p>
<p>Like several federal agencies, NIJ does not administer
Challenges under the authority of America COMPETES; instead,
the agency relies on underlying statutory authority to award
Challenge prizes. Because NIJ does not administer Challenges
under the authority of America COMPETES, results data were
not submitted to Challenge.gov. All information relevant to
this Challenge, including but not limited to background,
evaluation criteria, applicant instructions, prize
information, contact information, and award winners was made
publically available on <a
        href="http://nij.gov/funding/pages/fy13-ultra-high-speed-apps-challenge.aspx">NIJ's
    website</a>.</p>
<h2>Challenge Type: Software</h2>
<p>One of the reasons that this Challenge was particularly
successful was because NIJ developed appropriate objectives,
judging, and evaluation criteria through intramural research
and outreach to the field. NIJ relies heavily on the
practitioner end-user to define technology performance
requirements, because those who have to use a technology are
best positioned to understand what it must be able to do and
how it might best be used.</p>
<p>Contestants were encouraged to develop their submissions in
collaboration with criminal justice agencies capable of
providing insight into available data and agency operations;
a UHS provider and a software developer.&nbsp; That helped
ensure the feasibility and relevance of the resulting
apps.</p>
<p>Once the Challenge was launched, NIJ spread the word to
interested parties through press releases and social media
content; and performing targeted outreach to interested
parties at relevant conferences and events.</p>
<h2>Legal Authority</h2>
<p>NIJ used the general NIJ statute that authorizes research,
and the authority of 28 USC section 530C; America Competes
Act was not the Authority for Challenges for NIJ at the time
of the Ultra High-speed App Challenge.</p>
