<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Each year, about 400 people in the United States die from
unintentional carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. The CO in
these incidents comes from fuel-burning appliances, such as
furnaces, gas ranges, water heaters, portable generators and
charcoal grills, and from motor vehicles. The CPSC's Carbon
Monoxide Safety Poster Contest is designed to educate middle
school students about carbon monoxide poisoning dangers and
prevention. Students participating in the contest review
available information about CO and use their creativity to
make posters warning others of the dangers of CO, "the
invisible killer."</p>

<p>The primary objective of CPSC's poster contest is to prevent
carbon monoxide poisoning injuries and deaths by increasing
CO safety awareness and residential use of CO alarms. CPSC
works to engage and educate communities nationwide and on
military bases around the world with this poster contest.
The students will hopefully use this knowledge to prevent
carbon monoxide poisoning in their homes.</p>
<p>CPSC's 2015 poster contest challenge offered $500 each to
nine finalists, including three each in sixth, seventh and
eighth grade; $500 to one finalist chosen by public vote on
CPSC's website; and an additional $1,000 to the grand prize
winner. Prize money totaled $6,000 and came from the budget
of CPSC's Office of Communications.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>CPSC successfully engaged middle school students on the
dangers of CO with its poster contest. &nbsp;In 2015, the
poster contest challenge received a record 700 entries from
middle school students across the United States and U.S.
military bases overseas. This represents a 75 percent
increase in the number of entries over CPSC's previous
poster contests. CPSC announced the 2015 poster contest
winners in May 2015 on CPSC's blog, <em>OnSafety</em>.
Because the winners are all minors, CPSC posted only their
first names, grades and home states to protect their
privacy.</p>
<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Areas of Excellence #1: "Prioritize Goals and
Outcomes"</strong></p>
<p>The primary goal of the poster contest is to help raise
awareness about the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning
associated with consumer products. The larger, long-term
objective is to prevent injuries and deaths from carbon
monoxide poisoning in the years ahead. Middle school
students are challenged to educate themselves about CO
dangers and to create a compelling and attention-grabbing
poster to showcase what they learned and steps they should
take to protect themselves and their families from carbon
monoxide poisoning. Students developed novel approaches to
their posters, including a colorful
drawing of a canary with the words: "Keep the canary
singing. You shouldn't rely on a canary to warn you about
carbon monoxide. Install a carbon monoxide detector in your
home." Another winner drew a blindfolded
girl, who could not see or smell the carbon monoxide
floating around her, coupled with the words: "The invisible
killer. Odorless, colorless, tastelessâ€”can kill within
minutes." Another student created a poster depicting "Codie
the CO safety cat" teaching kids about carbon
monoxide dangers.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Develop Submission
Requirements"</strong></p>
<p>CPSC limited the poster contest to middle school students in
sixth, seventh and eighth grades. Students must create
posters on their own, without help from family, friends or
others.</p>
<p>Students can use any poster topic involving CO safety. CPSC
suggested the following possible poster topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Safety-Education/Safety-Education-Centers/Carbon-Monoxide-Information-Center/">Facts
about CO</a>: You cannot see it or smell it. CO is
an invisible killer.
</li>
<li>What steps you can take to protect against CO
poisoning
</li>
<li>How to recognize CO exposure and symptoms</li>
<li>How to install and test CO alarms and why they are
important
</li>
</ul>
<p>Contest rules required students to submit their poster
entries online. Because
the contest involves children under the age of 13, CPSC's
priority is their safety and privacy. CPSC complies with the
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and
its accompanying regulations protecting the privacy of
children using the Internet.&nbsp; CPSC requires verifiable
parental consent via a contest submission and parental
consent form for all contestants.&nbsp; In the contest
rules, CPSC states that the agency will collect and publish
a minimal amount of information about the contestants along
with their posters, and will include only their first names,
grade levels and states of residence.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #3: "Execute the
Communications Plan"</strong></p>
<p>CPSC publicized the CO poster contest with direct appeals to
middle school science and art teachers in dozens of school
districts across the United States and in U.S. military
schools overseas. CPSC also requested help from the National
Fire Protection Association, the U.S. Fire Administration
and the Girl Scouts to publicize the contest; and the agency
contacted teachers who had taken part in CPSC's previous
poster contest to tell them about the new poster contest
challenge.</p>
<h2>Challenge Type</h2>
<p><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p>CPSC's carbon monoxide poster contest challenged students to
create a work of art that not only looked appealing, but
also had a strong educational message about a dangerous
killer right in their own homes, carbon monoxide. Students
were also challenged to show how CO could be prevented with
carbon monoxide alarms and other safety measures.</p>
