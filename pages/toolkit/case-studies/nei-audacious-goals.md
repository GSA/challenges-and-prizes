<h1>Audacious Goals in Vision Research</h1>
<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid #e4e4e4;" class="spb-heading spb-text-heading"><span>National Eye Institute (NEI)</span>
</h3>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>NEI, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
recognized that recent technological breakthroughs were
propelling paradigm shifts in biomedical research. Vision
scientists are pioneering gene therapy, developing stem cell
technologies and creating molecular therapies to prevent
vision loss and restore sight. Recognizing that a concerted
effort might lead to dramatic&nbsp;improvement in treating
patients with vision loss, NEI wanted input from the
research and patient community to set audacious goals for
research. How could NEI alter the playing field to end
blindness and catalyze new fields of science?</p>
<p>This Audacious Goals Initiative (AGI) ideation challenge
offered a $3,000 prize for each winning submission (up to
20) for proposing audacious goals to stimulate innovation in
vision research. To qualify as an audacious goal, a solver's
one-page proposal needed to complete the thought: "It would
be fantastic if…" Submissions needed to address barriers and
next steps and were judged on five equally weighted
criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Audaciousness: </strong>bold, transformative,
innovative ideas
</li>
<li><strong>Impact</strong>: broad implications across
biomedical research
</li>
<li><strong>Relevance to the NEI mission</strong>: to
fundamentally change vision research or vision care
</li>
<li><strong>Scope: </strong>beyond the output of a single
investigator — collaboration across disciplines
</li>
<li><strong>Feasibility: </strong>to be achievable in about
10 years
</li>
</ul>

<p>NEI took advantage of the authority in the America COMPETES
Act to fund and run the competition. A simple challenge
format was chosen to encourage the vision community to think
differently and also to attract innovators in disciplines
that don't typically participate in NEI research. NEI
launched the three-month AGI challenge with great fanfare,
advertising in the Federal Register, online scientific
journals, social media and at medical conferences. It hosted
informational webinars and reached out to various
stakeholders through partner organizations and through its
research network. NEI consulted an advertising firm to help
place ads but ran the challenge through its own website. It
created its own platform with a database that de-identified
submissions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>NEI received 476 entries in the competition from across the
country, with an impressive diversity of occupations and
career stages listed on the applications (providing
occupation information was optional). Each submission could
only have one author, but solvers were encouraged to submit
multiple entries. Although the COMPETES Act and NIH rules
prohibited NIH employees and foreign citizens from
participating in the competition, NEI created a parallel
submission process to solicit ideas from these
stakeholders—while not eligible to win prize money, they
were eligible to receive recognition. With the combined
pools of submissions, NEI received a total of 548 ideas. Of
those, 198 entries came from current or former NEI grantees,
an additional 42 represented grantees from other NIH
institutes, but over half of the ideas came from individuals
new to NIH.</p>
<p>The review process had two phases. First, a group of
clinicians and scientists outside of NIH with broad
expertise in relevant disciplines evaluated the submissions
against the stated criteria, narrowing the entries to 81
proposals. A federal judging panel then selected 10
challenge winners. The winners were invited to present their
ideas to more than 200 cross-disciplinary experts at a 2013
NEI AGI development meeting. This challenge generated
valuable contributions from varied stakeholders to inform
NEI's strategic plan, energize its research efforts,
increase public awareness of vision research and enhance the
national effort to reduce the burden of ocular disorders and
diseases worldwide.</p>
<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Judge Submissions and
Select Winners"</strong></p>
<p>NEI employed a multi-tiered review process to select winners,
with technical experts outside of NIH providing input to a
federal judging panel. The large number of submissions, most
received in the final days of the competition, forced NEI to
adjust its initial review strategy and to recruit more
technical experts. All entries were de-identified and
initially screened by NEI staff; entries that unambiguously
failed to satisfy judging criteria were eliminated. The
remaining 474 submissions were categorized by primary,
secondary and tertiary topics (such as regenerative
medicine, neuroscience and healthcare) and sent for
technical review by 81 external scientific experts, based on
subject matter. NEI identified experts based on extensive
medical literature searches and portfolio analysis of NEI
grantees. Experts were required to sign a confidentiality
agreement and were excluded from reviewing any submission
which posed potential conflicts of interest through
personal, professional or institutional connections. This
first round of judging, which lasted two weeks, identified
submissions worthy of more in-depth review. Experts were
assigned submissions in their area of expertise and asked to
provide a numerical score and technical comments relative to
the judging criteria outlined on the Federal Register
announcement. They were also invited to review the remaining
entries and provide ordinal scores for meritorious
submissions. This alternative scoring process allowed
experts to single out creative solutions that might
otherwise be discarded in a scoring process which relied on
averaging results. Numerical scores from all the judges were
normalized and combined to provide a rank order of
submissions, of which the top 15 percent were included in
the final review. The projects identified with the top
ordinal scores were also included for review. A panel of
senior NIH leaders reviewed the technical comments and
scores from the top 15 percent of projects for two weeks.
During a half-day face-to-face meeting, they selected 10
prize winners based on the de-identified ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Manage
Solutions"</strong></p>
<p>NEI invited the competition winners to present their ideas at
the AGI Development Meeting in February 2013. In addition to
prize awards, NEI paid up to $5,000 for participant travel
expenses. This meeting brought together nearly 200 thinkers,
leading biomedical researchers and clinicians to transform
the winning ideas into a set of audacious goals. Over the
course of three days, participants combined and fine-tuned
the ideas in break-out groups and arrived at six
proposals.</p>
<p>NEI leadership reviewed these proposals and ultimately
selected a primary audacious goal: "To restore vision
through regeneration of neurons or neural connections in the
eye and visual system." Additionally, two other proposals
became new NEI research programs: "Intersection of Aging and
Eye Disease" and "Molecular Therapy at the Gene Level."
Subsequent implementation of the AGI also has involved
community input, with external steering committees,
workshops and town hall meetings informing the development
of funding initiatives. The initiative has impacted funding
decisions, as projects related to the initiative can be
designated for priority funding with high program relevance.
Concerted strategic planning towards the AGI has led to the
development of targeted funding opportunities. These goals
recognize that many leading causes of blindness like
age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and
glaucoma result from degeneration of neurons in the eye.
However, the achievement of this goal will greatly influence
all of neuroscience and the treatment of neurodegenerative
diseases.</p>
<h2>Challenge Type</h2>
<p><strong>Ideas</strong></p>
<p>The NEI AGI challenge was well-suited to soliciting ideas
from diverse stakeholders including patients, clinicians,
engineers and information scientists, who provided inputs
beyond the traditional pool of vision researchers.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific</strong></p>
<p>In addition to identifying unexplored areas of vision
research, analysis of the overall patterns of ideas was a
large factor in selecting the ultimate initiatives. For
example, neurosciences and regenerative medicine were two of
the most common themes repeated in the submissions, and both
these concepts were incorporated into the audacious goal
<em>(see attached Word Cloud).</em></p>
