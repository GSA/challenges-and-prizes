<h1>"Fishing for Fishermen" Maritime Data Challenge</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>On Sept. 8, 2017, NMIO completed the "Fishing for Fishermen" Maritime Data
Challenge, a worldwide crowdsourcing algorithm development competition that
sought to develop a method that would enable authorities to more effectively
identify and respond to illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing
activity around the world.</p>

<p>Those who engage in IUU fishing derive economic benefit by circumventing
conservation and sustainable fishing harvest limits, thereby inflicting serious
environmental harm. By applying innovative analytic techniques to existing data
sources, the competition sought to develop a process to more effectively
identify and react to the global IUU fishing threat. The goal was to make the
process available to all authorities worldwide.</p>
<p>The Data Challenge was managed by Topcoder and co-sponsored by the U.S.
Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security. &nbsp;NMIO partnered
with the NASA and the Harvard University Crowd Innovation Lab to manage the
competition.</p>
<p>The competition, run in two phases over two years, attracted 119 contestants from
33 countries.</p>
<p>NMIO and its partners also used crowdsourcing to develop the information graphic
explaining the purpose of the competition, and why it was important. The winning
entry was selected from more than 10 submissions, and was chosen because it
clearly explained what we were seeking, and why it was important, thereby
encouraging those competitors to participate in order to help protect the
environment and address a problem that is not necessarily well-publicized or
widely appreciated. This graphic also ensured that all of the participating
agencies and offices were recognized for their efforts.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The first phase of the competition, Marathon Match I, was designed to identify
which vessels in 10 pre-selected fishing areas were engaged in fishing. Marathon
Match I attracted 77 competitors. The winning algorithm had an accuracy rate
above 98 percent.</p>
<p>The second, more complex phase, Marathon Match II, involved 56 active competitors
and sought to determine the <em>type</em> of fishing activities the vessels were
engaged in. The winning algorithm had the following accuracy rates for the
specified fishing type:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support – 97-98 percent</li>
<li>Long-liner – 96-97 percent</li>
<li>Trawler – 95 percent</li>
<li>Seiner – 91-92 percent</li>
</ul>
<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Build a Team"</strong></p>
<p>By partnering with U.S. Government agencies, academia, and industry, NMIO was
able to build a team of maritime stakeholders who were interested in addressing
the problem of IUU fishing around the world.</p>
<p>The use of crowdsourcing allowed NMIO and its Data Challenge partners to, in
turn, gain access to some of the world's leading algorithmic scientists for a
fraction of the cost required to either hire such talent or to contract for it
through an established vendor. For an investment of under $250,000 over a
two-year period (less than the cost for one full-time equivalent, or FTE), NMIO
and the Data Challenge Team were able to tap into experienced data scientists
across the globe who delivered highly accurate algorithms that can be used by
fishery analysts and enforcement authorities globally to support their efforts
in combating IUU fishing.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Share Best Practices and Results"</strong>
</p>
<p>From the beginning, our intent was to make the winning algorithms publically
available to enable analysts and enforcement personnel globally to more
effectively identify and react to the global IUU fishing threat. The winning
algorithms and supporting documentation are available on <a
href="https://github.com/NASA-Tournament-Lab/National-Maritime-Intelligence-Integration-Office-NMIO-Fishing-for-Fishermen"><span
style="border: none;">GITHUB</span></a>.</p>
<p>In September 2017, NMIO partnered with the Stimson Center, Waitt Foundation, and
National Geographic to host partners Costa Rica and Chile for a workshop focused
on identifying ways to combat IUU fishing within these partner nations' waters.
At this event, NMIO announced the winners of the challenge competitions,
provided participating stakeholders the GITHUB information, and requested
feedback from any stakeholder using the algorithms.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, one of our challenge partners briefed our effort to more than
120 maritime stakeholders at the Global Maritime Forum, held at California State
University – Maritime in Vallejo, Calif. As a result of that presentation and
the interest it created, we are exploring how best to capture metrics and
feedback from the stakeholders using the algorithms.</p>
<h2>Challenge Type: Algorithms, Visualizations, and Analytics</h2>
<p>The use of crowdsourcing yielded algorithms that were surprisingly accurate and
reliable in their ability to identify fishing activity, and then to help
identify the type of that activity. Once transmitted to authorities in a usable
format, this will allow them to best identify and respond to suspected illegal
fishing activity, and to make the best decisions regarding limited and valuable
resources. Crowdsourcing also allowed NMIO to have the leading results
peer-evaluated to ensure their reliability and validity.</p>
<h2>Legal Authority</h2>
<p>Title II of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act (Public Law 111-358),
through our partners at NASA.</p>
