<h1>Travel Data Challenge</h1>
<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid #e4e4e4;"  class="spb-heading spb-text-heading"><span>General Services Administration (GSA)</span>
</h3>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>GSA manages a broad portfolio of government operations. This
portfolio yields extensive operations data that may hold
potential solutions to some of government's most pressing
problems. GSA's Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP)
sponsored the GSA Travel Data Challenge in hopes of driving
smarter business decisions by bringing a quantitative
approach to the travel data the federal government
collects.</p>
<p>One key purpose of the challenge was to attain a tool that
can provide greater visibility into government agency travel
spending. With greater visibility, efficiencies might be
found that can lead to more transparency, accountability and
cost-saving measures that save money for American taxpayers.
For this challenge, the public was asked to develop software
that would use GSA's travel data to address this goal and be
scalable across other government agencies.</p>

<p>OGP provided its solvers with three travel-related data
sets—voucher data, reservation data and Smartpay transaction
data—from fiscal years 2011-2013. To be deemed successful, a
solver needed to use the data to answer several questions
about how the government makes cost and efficiency
improvements. In addition, a successful solution needed to
prove adaptable to other government agencies.</p>
<p>GSA offered up to three prizes: a grand prize of $35,000, a
runner-up prize of $30,000 and an honorable mention prize of
$25,000 for solutions that met the requirements and would be
used by GSA. However, GSA only ended up awarding a single
prize of $35,000 since only one submission met all of the
requirements and would be used by GSA in the future.</p>
<p>The competition was launched on Feb. 14, 2014 and closed on
April 11, 2014. The winner was announced on May 9, 2014.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The winning entrant designed an innovative technology tool
using open-source code to help agencies better visualize and
understand their data, compare their travel data against key
benchmarks and identify behaviors to reduce costs on future
travel. The winner is a freelance web developer who had not
previously worked with GSA.&nbsp; GSA plans to incorporate
concepts from this tool into future capabilities to provide
agencies with comprehensive travel spending analysis and
benchmarking.</p>
<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Develop Terms and
Conditions"</strong></p>
<p>The project manager for this challenge worked closely with
GSA's Office of General Counsel (OGC) to ensure compliance
with all policies, authorities and regulations, as well as
receive advice on several aspects of the challenge:</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation Panel</strong>: Collaboration with OGC was
critical to ensuring the appropriate approvals and
permissions to work with Sam Gilliland, former executive at
Sabre Corporation. Gilliland served as a technical advisor
on the challenge evaluation panel, and because the company
he formerly worked for does business with the government,
OGP had to ensure there was no conflict of interest in
Gilliland serving as one of the advisors.</p>
<p><strong>Prizes/Winners</strong>: OGP also worked with OGC to
make sure the terms and conditions of the competition were
written to explicitly allow for the evaluation panel to
award prizes, only if GSA had plans to use the developers'
products in the future. The competition allowed for up to
three prizes to be awarded, but GSA retained the right to
award fewer than three prizes. This was important, because
in the end the evaluation panel determined that only one
solution merited prize money and awarded a single $35,000
prize to the winner. Furthermore, because the challenge was
focused on developing open-source technology, GSA needed to
specify how the government would "own" any winning
solutions.&nbsp; The winning solution was essentially
purchased by the government by awarding the prize money and
transferring all code and management rights for the solution
to OGP. The government was given access to the code via an
open source code repository and given management rights to
the tool itself, which was hosted on a domain set up by the
solver.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility</strong>: OGP worked with OGC to draft
rules of eligibility for the challenge. Key rules included
the following: participants must be U.S. citizens, groups of
individuals could submit solutions but prize money would be
awarded at the submission level and federal employees were
allowed to participate in the challenge if working on their
own personal time and not acting within the scope of their
employment.</p>
<p>The full sets of rules and requirements can be viewed at <a

</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Execute the
Communications Plan"</strong></p>
<p>In addition to listing the challenge on Challenge.gov, OGP
worked with GSA's Office of Communications and Marketing to
promote the challenge through blog posts and news outlets.
GSA also made a video about the challenge which was posted
along with the competition details on the challenge website
and referred to in blog posts. Furthermore, OGP contacted
top university public policy and computer science programs
to encourage students to participate in the competition.</p>
<p>Finally, because GSA utilized ChallengePost, emails were sent
to ChallengePost's list of subscribers promoting the
challenge and encouraging people to apply. The challenge
site also offered a discussion board, where the OGP project
manager moderated and responded to approximately 25
discussion topics throughout the two months that the
competition was open. These efforts resulted in 185 people
registering to participate in the challenge and 14
submissions received. Given the relatively low dollar value
of the potential prizes and the short time frame for
competitors to develop and submit their solutions, this was
seen as a success.</p>
<h2>Challenge Type</h2>
<p><strong>Software and Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Criteria for this challenge were specific enough to guide
solvers towards a usable solution for the government, but
flexible enough to accommodate innovation and creativity in
designing those solutions. Because the challenge encouraged
the use of open-source technologies, solvers were able to
leverage work done on different platforms, for different
uses, and re-purpose it to meet the needs of this challenge,
or develop their own visualizations and prototypes from
scratch. Many of the submissions OGP received displayed high
quality, innovative data visualizations that were dynamic,
filterable and user friendly. Many of the developers were
able to use graphic design techniques and digital best
practices to come up with unique, interesting ways to view
the travel data.</p>
