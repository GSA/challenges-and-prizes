<p>With more than 50 percent of the U.S. population living
within 50 miles of coastlines, there is vast potential to
provide clean, renewable electricity to communities and
cities in the United States using wave energy. It is
estimated that the technically recoverable wave energy
resource is approximately 900-1,200 terawatt hours (TWh) per
year. Developing just a small fraction of the available wave
energy resource could allow for millions of American homes
to be powered with this clean, reliable form of energy. For
context, approximately 90,000 homes could be powered by 1
TWh per year. Extracting just 5 percent of the technical
resource potential could result in wave energy powering 5
million American homes.</p>
<p><u>Engagement</u></p>
<p>The Wave Energy Prize has successfully mobilized both new and
existing talent through the challenge, with engineers,
developers and builders from across the country having
thrown their hats in the ring. Participants include people
who represent universities, small companies, more
established players in wave energy and independent
collaborations. Also, through the <a
href="http://waveenergyprize.org/marketplace"><em>Marketplace</em></a>,
the competition has provided an online forum for external
interested parties to collaborate with participating teams.
</p>
<p><u>Detailed prize structure</u></p>
<p>The Wave Energy Prize is divided into three phases (design,
build, and test) separated by four technology gates as shown
and described below:</p>
<p><strong><em>Design</em></strong>: For the first part of the
design phase, participants were required to submit detailed

technical submissions describing
their WEC concepts. The judging panel evaluated these
submissions according to the Technology Performance Level
rubric developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
and selected up to 20 qualified teams. These teams were then
tasked with building 1/50th scale prototypes of their WEC
concepts, numerically modeling their performance and
developing detailed build plans for 1/20th scale prototypes.
Qualified teams were required to test their 1/50th scale
prototypes in 31 different sea states at one of five
small-scale testing facilities (University of Iowa,
University of Maine, University of Michigan, Stevens
Institute of Technology and Oregon State University) across
the country.&nbsp; The judging panel then evaluated device
performance, numerical modeling results and build plans to
select nine finalist and two alternate teams.&nbsp; The
judging panel then selected up to ten finalists and two
alternates from the qualified teams.</p>
<p><strong><em>Build</em></strong>: Finalist and alternate teams
were tasked with building 1/20th scale prototypes of their
WEC concepts. Finalists were given up to $125,000 and
alternates $25,000 to build these prototypes, with
alternates becoming eligible for up to $125,000 were they to
become finalists. Each team was paired with a data analyst
from either the National Renewable Energy Laboratory or
Sandia National Laboratories. Finalists and alternates
worked with engineers at the Naval Surface Warfare Center
Carderock Division and their assigned data analysts to come
up with comprehensive test and evaluation plans to ensure a
successful testing campaign at the Carderock Maneuvering and
Seakeeping (MASK) Basin. The judging panel then selected
nine finalist teams to proceed to testing at the MASK Basin
starting August 2016.</p>
<p><strong><em>Test</em></strong>: Each finalist team has been
given one week on site at Carderock to prepare for testing
and then one week of testing time in the MASK Basin. The
test is to determine whether their 1/20th scale devices are
double the state-of-the-art performance of WECs and thus
eligible to win the grand prize. If a team becomes eligible
to win the grand prize, their WEC device's performance will
be further evaluated to account for other important energy
capture, reliability and survivability metrics using proxy
measurements collected during MASK Basin testing. The
testing program will provide the Department of Energy (DOE)
and investors with apples-to-apples comparisons of WEC
device techno-economic performance when operating in real
ocean conditions.</p>
<p><u>Administrators and partners</u></p>
<p>DOE's Water Power Program, along with a contracted prize
administration team comprised of Ricardo, Inc., JZ
Consulting, and Polaris Strategic Communications; technical
experts from Sandia National Laboratories and the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory; and staff at the Naval Surface
Warfare Center Carderock Division are responsible for
implementing the prize design, build, and test phases.</p>
<p>DOE also has partnered with various branches of the
Department of the Navy to successfully execute the
challenge. The Office of Naval Research has provided funds
to develop the technologies and capabilities required to
ensure fair and rigorous testing in the MASK Basin; the
Naval Surface Warfare Center has provided in-kind support
for the Judging Panel and reduced facility costs; and the
Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Energy, Installations,
and Environment has provided support to test three of the
finalists in the MASK Basin.</p>
<p>The prize team also created a two-person independent expert
review panel of prize and challenge experts—one from the
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and one
formerly of the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency—that, during go/no-go meetings for the challenge,
provided guidance to the prize team on all aspects of the
project, including testing program logistics, communications
and outreach, and event planning.</p>
<p><u>Incentives</u></p>
<p>The Wave Energy Prize has provided a thoughtful package of
incentives to attract developers to compete and allow them
the opportunity to reach their full potential and meet the
goal of doubling&nbsp;the state of the art performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>A total of $2.25 million is reserved for the prize purse
($1.5 million grand prize, $500,000 for second place and
$250,000 for third place)
</li>
<li>Seed funding for up to 10 finalists ($125,000 each) and
alternates ($25,000 each)
</li>
<li>Small-scale testing to all qualified teams valued at
close to $45,000 per team
</li>
<li>Testing for all finalists at the MASK Basin at Carderock
valued at $180,000-$200,000 per test
</li>
<li>The creation of a team-building platform (the <em>Marketplace</em>)
located on the competition website, where teams can
solicit expert needs, or experts can seek out teams
</li>
<li>An open source numerical software package, <a
href="https://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/">Wave
Energy Converter Simulation</a> (WEC-Sim) developed and
supported by the DOE national labs, and supporting
software provided for free by MathWorks for use by all
qualified teams choosing to use it for the duration of
the competition
</li>
<li>A team summit with opportunities to engage with
technical experts, investors, media, and government
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The challenge is not yet complete, but there have been
numerous successes so far in attracting new and existing
players to wave energy; having teams successfully reach
aggressive technical milestones; bringing forward
innovations across a range of WEC device types; generating
significant publicity; and building technical capacity to
test WECs at testing facilities across the country.</p>
<p>With an aggressive communications and outreach strategy, 92
teams registered for the competition, three times more than
expected. Of these, 66 turned in technical submissions,
which were evaluated by a panel of expert judges to identify
20 qualified teams. Most teams that registered were not
previously known to DOE. Seventeen of the 20 qualified teams
completed the initial small-scale testing phase, and out of
the nine finalists and two alternates, only two have
received any funding from DOE in the past.</p>
<p>Most of the teams have met the aggressive timelines for the
challenge. For example, to meet the requirements for
Technology Gate 2, the qualified teams built 1/50th scale
model devices, tested them at university facilities around
the country and conducted significant numerical modeling
studies in just four months. As of June 2016, and as can be
seen on the <a
href="http://waveenergyprize.org/teams/updates">Team
Updates webpage</a>, finalists and alternates have made
significant progress in designing, building, and testing
their 1/20th scale devices. This puts the challenge in a
great position to achieve its remaining objectives.</p>
<p>The finalists and alternates have put forward diverse WEC
designs, which include two submerged areal absorbers, four
point absorbers, two attenuators and three terminators. And
in these designs, DOE is already seeing technical
innovations in the areas of geometry, materials, power
conversion and controls. Some of these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>adaptive sea-state-to-sea-state control,</li>
<li>wave-to-wave control,</li>
<li>power absorption in multiple degrees of freedom,</li>
<li>optimized float shapes and dimensions for energy
absorption for broad bandwidth of wave frequencies,
</li>
<li>survival strategies such as submerging beneath the
surface for extreme storms,
</li>
<li>use of structures and materials that are cost effective
to manufacture, and
</li>
<li>flexible membranes that react to the wave pressure over
a broad area.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The public's awareness of wave energy is increasing because
of the teams' efforts in the challenge. In just over a year,
more than 100 news stories have featured the competition,
including channels like <em>Popular Science</em>, <em>The
Weather Channel</em> and <em>National Geographic</em>.
The website has hosted more than 23,000 visitors, and its
social media channels have logged more than a half million
impressions. This increased awareness of the potential
contribution of wave energy to the nation's renewable energy
mix will exist long after the challenge ends and will likely
set the stage for future private-sector investments and
government funding opportunities.</p>
<p>In the process of executing the testing program, the
small-scale testing facilities (University of Iowa,
University of Maine, University of Michigan, Stevens
Institute of Technology and Oregon State University) and the
Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division have gained
significant technical capabilities and capacities to
rigorously test WECs.</p>
<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Identify Goal and Outcome
Metrics"</strong></p>
<p>There needs to be a step change in the levelized cost of
energy (LCOE) of wave energy to put it on a path to
commercialization as an electricity generation source in
large-scale utility markets in the next 15 to 20 years. It
is the goal of the challenge to achieve that step change: a
doubling of the state-of-the-art performance of WECs, as
measured through their energy absorbed per unit structural
cost.</p>

</div>
<p>LCOE is the commonly accepted metric that points to the
commercial viability of a source of energy.&nbsp; LCOE
allows for comparisons of the costs of electricity produced
by different means and sources such as solar, wind, fossil
and so on. But LCOE is a complicated metric, and its value
reflects many different variables, from details of capital
expenditures to various factors influencing operational
expenditures.&nbsp; Due to limited experience in building
and operating WECs, estimates of these cost details have a
high degree of uncertainty, and for low Technology Readiness
Levels (TRLs), LCOE may not be an appropriate metric to
judge device or system potential. In addition, it's hard to
test for a bunch of variables in a prize competition given
limited testing resources and time constraints. The prize
team sought to design a simple metric that could best
measure the relevant parameters of an early maturity yet
techno-economically viable system when operating in real
ocean conditions. Thus, the team created a simplified proxy
metric for LCOE that would target key components of LCOE to
show WEC device potential.</p>
<p>Given that wave energy converters (WECs) are early maturity
technologies, there was no standardized way of testing
diverse WECs to evaluate their performance before the
competition. Thus, the key metric of the challenge had to
satisfy the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>To be able to objectively quantify the potential of high
techno-economic performance to bring about a step change
improvement over the state of the art
</li>
<li>To be able to quantify the state of the art with respect
to this fundamental performance metric
</li>
<li>To fully embrace the fair and accountable assessment of
fundamentally new WEC concepts (potentially leading to
disruptive technology innovation), innovations not
foreseeable at the onset of the competition
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these requirements, the technical experts at the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Sandia National
Laboratories worked with DOE and the prize administration
team to develop a new metric to measure the state-of-the-art
performance of WECs and the ACE (Average Climate Capture
Width per Characteristic Capital Expenditure). ACE
represents the energy captured per unit structural cost of
WECs. This is a proxy metric for LCOE. Just like LCOE is a
cost-to-benefit metric ($/kWh), ACE is a benefit-to-cost
metric that focuses on a key component that drives LCOE for
WECs, namely structural cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;The denominator of
ACE is a measure of the structural cost of the device,
evaluated based on technical drawings, materials used and
analytical load estimation on the structure device.</p>
<p>The state-of-the-art value for ACE is 1.5 meters per million
dollars (1.5m/$M). A finalist becomes eligible to win the
$1.5 million grand prize if they double ACE to 3m/$M during
the final round of testing at the MASK Basin in
Carderock.</p>
<p>The prize team still believed that ACE, while a significant
step in the right direction for evaluating the performance
of WECs, did not provide full confidence in WECs that could
meet the true challenge of performing at reasonable cost in
the open ocean. Thus, the prize team decided to evaluate
teams eligible to win the grand prize according to a metric
called Hydrodynamic Performance Quality (HPQ) which accounts
for other important energy capture, reliability and
survivability metrics using proxy measurements collected
during MASK Basin testing. The teams that surpass the 3m/$M
threshold will be ranked by their HPQ, and the team with the
highest HPQ will win the $1.5 million grand prize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Obtain Agency
Clearance"</strong></p>
<p>The DOE prize team in the Water Power Program engaged with
senior leadership from the very inception of the idea to run
a prize competition. Office leadership was briefed during
the development of the challenge, including on topics such
as goals, rules, testing program, judging process and
communications and outreach plan. General Counsel (GC)
informed the development of the rules, as well as the terms
and conditions.</p>
<p>The DOE prize team also worked with GC from the very
beginning of drafting the funding opportunity announcement
for a prize administration team. GC helped the team prepare
the Federal Register Notice in time for the announcement of
the launch of the prize competition.</p>
<p>Given that the prize administration team was selected under a
financial assistance agreement, the DOE contracting officer
has been engaged in each important phase, especially in the
go/no-go decisions where the team performed a rigorous
evaluation of the prize continuation application after the
registration period closed and after the end of the 1/50th
scale testing program. The DOE National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) staff, also part of the prize team, have ensured
that all actions taken by participants during the
competition meet the requirements of NEPA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #3: "Execute the
Communications Plan"</strong></p>
<p>The Wave Energy Prize has used several approaches to
successfully publicize the prize, mobilize potential
participants and create a strong following for the
competition, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emailing previous applicants to and inquirers of Water
Power Program funding opportunities
</li>
<li>Creating a website that allows for streamlined updates,
as well as a back end that participants can use to
engage with the prize administration team and DOE
</li>
<li>Creating the <em>Marketplace</em>, a skill-sharing
platform that promoted team-building, on the website
</li>
<li>Creating and disseminating a monthly newsletter that
answered frequently asked questions and presented
technical details in simple language, along with
communicating what DOE is striving to achieve
</li>
<li>Creating a strong social media presence that has created
a large following for the competition
</li>
<li>Training participants on communications, outreach, and
media training
</li>
<li>Disseminating publicly important data generated from the
competition
</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, teams have been required per the rules to <a
href="http://waveenergyprize.org/teams/update">communicate
publicly</a> on the website about their progress and to
speak about the challenge and their participation in their
own words. Participants put a lot of blood, sweat and tears
into a competition, and it is important to shed light on
their stories and why they are participating.</p>
<p>Below are details on how the prize team has worked to ensure
a successfully executed communications plan.</p>
<p><strong>Strong relationships with different communications
teams in DOE</strong>: The Wave Energy Prize has leveraged
the fact that different communications teams within DOE have
different audiences and outlets, and the prize team has
tailored content to the audiences reached by different
communications teams. Both the DOE prize team and the prize
administration team have worked to understand how different
communications teams in DOE from the Office of Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Energy and DOE Public Affairs work
and what their protocols are.</p>
<p><strong>Synergistic communications plans and
cross-promotion</strong>: The Wave Energy Prize is working
off a communications and outreach plan in which DOE prize
team communications and prize administration team
communications are synergistic, and there is a clear
delineation of the kinds of communications that come from
each of the two teams. All communications that the DOE prize
team and the prize administration team put out are planned
one month in advance to ensure momentum. Media coverage,
monthly newsletters and blogs and team features come from
the prize administration team; synthesis and reflection
pieces are written by the DOE prize team; and press releases
at key stages of the competition are published by both
teams. The prize administration team promotes all
communications relating to the prize coming from any DOE
office.</p>
<p><strong>Writing for multiple audiences and simple
communication</strong>: The Wave Energy Prize aims to
mobilize new and existing talent, increase visibility and
attract potential investors. To achieve these objectives, it
has been important to communicate goals, requirements,
processes and progress in the simplest language possible,
while being careful not to dilute the technical details the
prize team worked hard to solidify. The prize team has been
able to create content for those with varying degrees of
interest and expertise, as described below.</p>
<p>The goal of the Wave Energy Prize is to double the
state-of-the-art performance of wave energy converters as
measured through a metric called ACE, short for average
climate capture width per characteristic capital
expenditure—clearly a mouthful, and entirely jargon. ACE is
a measure of the effectiveness of a WEC at absorbing power
from the incident wave energy field divided by a measure of
the capital expenditure in commercial production of the load
bearing device structure. So how can that be said
simply?</p>
<p>Here is how this metric is communicated to the public: "ACE
is determined by dividing, in essence, the wave energy
extraction efficiency of a wave energy converter by its
structural cost." This language is simple enough that makes
the key metric of the Wave Energy Prize understandable to
many more people than just experts in wave energy. And the
prize team has been directing those interested in more of
the details to detailed blog posts with more technical
depth.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking impact and creating an archive: </strong>The
prize administration team has tracked all key statistics
pointing to the impact of communications efforts, including
visitor numbers; click-through rates; time spent on
webpages; geographic location; browser type; social media
impressions on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter; and so on.
The prize administration team provides monthly reports to
the DOE prize team on these statistics, and changes to
communications plans are made accordingly.</p>
<p>Also, since Wave Energy Prize is unfolding over 18 months,
the DOE prize team and prize administration team archive all
outreach and media content on the <a
href="http://waveenergyprize.org/newsroom"><em>Newsroom</em></a>
page of the competition website, creating a narrative arc
for those interested.</p>
<p>The DOE Wave Energy Prize won GSA Challenge.gov's Five Years
of Excellence in Federal Challenge &amp; Prize Competition
Award for Best Challenge Engagement Strategy, and its
communications plan was a key part of its success. The Wave
Energy Prize has tracked analytics on its various social
media platforms and its website, and developed a two-track
communications plan, one executed by the contractor selected
to administer the prize, and one executed by the
program-level agency team.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #4: "Accept
Solutions"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Registration and eligibility</strong>: The Wave
Energy Prize registration period started April 27, 2015, and
the end date was extended from June 15, 2015, to June 30,
2015, to maximize the number of teams entering the prize
funnel. During this extended window, registration jumped
from 50 teams on June 15 to 92 on June 30.</p>
<p>The terms and conditions specified the eligibility and
participation requirements per the America COMPETES
Reauthorization Act. These requirements spanned
indemnification and liability, insurance, and citizenship or
private company incorporation, among other things. When
participants registered, they were required to provide
documentation to attest to their eligibility, allowing the
prize administration team to only put the submissions
eligible to win through the time-intensive judging
process.</p>
<p><strong>Receiving and managing solutions</strong>: Those
participants making it through the Wave Energy Prize funnel
will have submitted electronic documentation (including
writing and drawings), codes and numerical modeling output
and device prototypes over the course of the competition.
All along, participants have been provided clear guidance on
how and when to submit their solutions, and the prize team
has ensured that any and all solutions provided by teams are
dealt with per the terms and conditions. The prize
administration team has come up with detailed plans for who
on the prize team handles what submission and when. Below
are additional steps and policies put in place to ensure
successful submissions from participants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participants submit all electronic documents on the Wave
Energy Prize website back end—custom-built for the prize
based on open source software—where the judging panel is
able to access them to complete their evaluations.
</li>
<li>The prize administration team worked with the
small-scale testing facilities to ensure the qualified
teams' 1/50th scale devices were properly received.
</li>
<li>For the 1/20th scale prototypes, the prize
administration team worked with a third party shipping
company to pick up and transfer devices from the
contiguous United States to the MASK Basin in Carderock,
Maryland.
</li>
<li>During the entire competition, participants have been
able to ask questions of the judges and technical
experts—through the prize administration team—to make
sure that any actions taken by the participants were
allowed per the rules and testing requirements.
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nondisclosure agreements and intellectual
property</strong>: The entire prize team (consisting of the
DOE, prize administration team, judges, Carderock, the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Sandia National
Laboratories) have signed or are bound by nondisclosure
agreements to ensure that all intellectual property of the
participants remains theirs. Further, all data and testing
documentation generated during the competition will be made
public on the DOE Marine and Hydrokinetic Data Repository in
November 2017, one year after winners are announced. The
documentation will be scrubbed of any intellectual property,
such as the detailed design drawings of solutions the
participants brought as their original concepts into the
competition. All details have been specified in the terms
and conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #5: "Pay Winners"</strong></p>
<p>Since the Wave Energy Prize is being executed under a
financial assistance agreement with the prize administration
team, it is the prize administration team (contractors) that
is responsible for disbursing both seed funding to the
finalists and alternates and the prize purse. These funds
were allocated to the prize administration team after
go/no-go decisions on the continuation of the Wave Energy
Prize program. The prize purse will be disbursed to the team
leader(s) of the winning team(s).</p>
<h2>Challenge Type</h2>
<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>
<p>Given the early maturity level of the wave energy industry,
the Wave Energy Prize has been structured and rules written
to maximize the diversity of devices that can be tested and
evaluated, and to allow for flexibility in dealing with
WECs. Thousands of hours have been put in by the technical
experts (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Sandia
National Laboratories, Carderock, University of Michigan,
University of Maine, University of Iowa, Stevens Institute
of Technology, Oregon State University and judges) over the
course of the competition to ensure the proper planning and
execution of the 1/50th and 1/20th scale testing programs.
This has instilled confidence in the participants of the
rigor of the competition and demonstrated to industry the
level of effort required to get apples-to-apples comparisons
of WEC performance.</p>
