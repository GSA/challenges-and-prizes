<h1>ISS Food Intake Tracker</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The current method for tracking dietary intake for astronauts
    in orbit on the International Space Station (ISS) is the
    Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). This is a weekly recall
    of what astronauts have eaten recorded by each astronaut in
    a spreadsheet and downlinked to the ground for analysis of
    several key nutrients. The FFQ has been able to show that
    crewmembers who have consumed more meals containing fish
    also lost less bone over a six-month mission. NASA believes
    this is related to the omega-3 fatty acid content of fish,
    but current data from the FFQ does not provide this level of
    detailed analysis. Also, the FFQ is not that easy to use,
    and some crewmembers find it hard to remember what they ate
    in the past seven days. An easier input process is needed,
    along with a more detailed log of dietary intake to better
    understand the role of nutrition in spaceflight and provide
    better dietary recommendations to help mitigate the negative
    physiological effects of spaceflight.</p>

<p>The challenge was to find a way for the crew to capture their
    food consumption data more easily and accurately. We
    launched a challenge to conceptualize, design and develop an
    iPad application that will allow ISS crewmembers to easily
    enter foods during each meal. The application needed to
    seamlessly identify the user, track all food and beverage
    intake and provide a timestamp of when the food was
    consumed. While many of the foods have barcode, others do
    not, especially foods that crews take in their "bonus"
    containers, which provide some unique items. The resulting
    ISS FIT (Food Intake Tracker) iPad App had to provide
    astronauts on the ISS an efficient, rapid and accurate
    method for tracking their dietary intake, while also
    tracking important nutrient data. The app also needed to
    include features and a user experience that incentivized the
    crewmembers to use the application with each meal.</p>
<p>The challenge was launched through NASA's contract with
    Harvard University using Topcoder. Topcoder provides a
    worldwide competitive community for application development.
    Team submissions were not permitted. Topcoder decomposed the
    challenge into 17 different contests that conceptualized the
    app, formulated the requirements, developed the user
    interface, designed the architecture, coded the modules,
    integrated the code and tested and debugged the app.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>This series of contests started in February 2013 and
    completed with delivery of the initial app in September
    2013. For these 17 contests there were 177 unique
    registrants from 20 different countries and a total of 79
    submissions. The total incentive purse was $36,288. Awards
    ranged from $350 up to $5,000 for submissions across the
    contests, with the average award being $2,592.</p>
<p>The contest resulted in a unique and user-friendly iPad
    application that will allow NASA astronauts to easily enter
    and track their daily dietary intake to create a more
    detailed food log. The app included features that
    crewmembers can use to help understand their food selections
    and the impacts on their diet which may incentivize some to
    use the app more frequently.&nbsp; This will enable NASA
    scientist to better understand the role of nutrition in
    spaceflight and provide better dietary recommendations to
    help mitigate the negative physiological effects of
    spaceflight. The application recently completed ground
    testing and certification and is anticipated to be uplinked
    to the ISS iPads in June 2016 for on-orbit use by ISS
    crewmembers.</p>

<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Identify Legal
    Authority"</strong></p>
<p>Challenges launched through NASA's Center of Excellence for
    Collaborative Innovations (CoECI) are considered
    procurements for goods or services. In this case, the
    government had a requirement for a product (an easy-to-use
    iPad app to track food intake of ISS crewmembers), and the
    contractor used crowdsourced competitions as the method for
    developing the product that met that requirement. Challenges
    conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation authority are
    the NASA contractor's responsibility to execute. They are
    considered the contractor's challenge, not NASA's. NASA is
    engaged in the activity throughout as the technical
    requirements owner and does actively participate,
    particularly during the challenge definition and evaluation
    phases depending on the contractor's business model.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Accept
    Solutions"</strong></p>
<p>This challenge accepted code submissions that would be
    licensed as open source software. NASA procured an
    end-to-end open source software solution from Topcoder
    through a series of contests using the Topcoder platform and
    community. Topcoder accepted and handled the submissions of
    all software source code for each contest and integrated
    each piece of code into the final product. The final
    software and documentation products were delivered to NASA
    as a complete open source repository. NASA required a full
    set of design documentation along with documented testing
    results of static security analysis and mitigations. NASA
    used these artifacts along with additional analysis to
    ensure that the project adhered to the . These steps
    included the classification of the software and the
    application of corresponding requirements for documentation
    and testing. Additionally, NASA provided user acceptance
    testing for each delivery, and NASA's ISS program office
    provided integrated load testing to ensure functionality and
    integration of the code with the ISS networks, servers and
    iPads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #3: "Pay Winners"</strong></p>
<p>While NASA procured the ISS Food Intake Tracker (FIT)
    software application as a product from Harvard and Topcoder,
    Topcoder's use of contests in its community of hundreds of
    thousands of software developers provided an extremely
    effective method of developing software. Topcoder's process
    of atomizing challenges into several smaller-phased contests
    was very successful in that it attracted specialized talent
    within its community and then had participants compete so
    the best work from those specialized members was selected
    and rewarded. This method of curating talent and rewarding
    those developers has demonstrated itself to be an effective
    method for not just developing software quickly and
    inexpensively, but also developing in a way that increases
    innovation and quality. Topcoder establishes a game plan
    that includes each of the various types of software
    development contests that comprise a particular development
    effort. These contests are launched under the purview of a
    co-pilot who chooses the winning submissions for each of the
    contest types based on the criteria specific to that
    particular development task. Many of the competitors who
    participate in these contests are doing so not just to earn
    the small award, but to hone their skills in the particular
    area or to earn Topcoder points toward their status level as
    a "topcoder." A Topcoder rating can serve as a significant
    boon on a resume. Since Topcoder is a contractor to NASA,
    Topcoder actually makes the payments to the winners of each
    contest directly. NASA does not pay the individual
    winners.</p>

<p>This challenge originated simply as a need of NASA's head
    nutrition scientist for ISS to improve the mechanism for&nbsp;collecting
    crew food consumption data so that he could improve the
    quality of the science. The recent introduction of iPad
    tablet computers for use on the ISS provided a unique
    opportunity to meet this need by developing a food tracker
    app similar to apps used widely by the public. However, this
    app also needed to address the unique aspects of the ISS
    crews, their food inventory and the science needs. It turned
    out to be a great fit to develop this software via a
    contractor such as Topcoder that uses contest-based
    development. Through these contests, the community
    identified several innovative approaches such as simple
    icon-based displays, bar-code scanner and camera software to
    capture foods simply and quickly, and voice notation options
    so crewmembers do not need to type. Additionally, the
    contests leveraged various skillsets from Topcoder's large
    community such that user interface experts competed to
    create the best displays, architecture experts competed to
    develop the optimum architecture and coding experts competed
    to develop code and leverage existing open source code. The
    broad range and depth of skills used on this project would
    have been difficult to replicate in an in-house team without
    requiring significant training or a high-performing
    team.</p>
