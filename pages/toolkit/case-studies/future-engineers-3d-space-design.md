<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Through a series of Future Engineers 3D Space Design
Challenges, students from 5 to 19 years old focus on solving
real-world space exploration problems and submit 3D model
designs of 3D printable objects for an astronaut to
theoretically use in space. &nbsp;The challenge was
developed to provide students with access to NASA's first 3D
Printing in Zero-G ISS Technology Demonstration aboard the
International Space Station, which validated the capability
of utilizing additive manufacturing technology in space. The
challenges provide students with NASA-mission-related design
and research problems to assist with advancing NASA's
technical capabilities. Submissions are judged on the
innovation and creativity of the solution, the ability to
advance human space exploration and the ability to
communicate the design and quality of the 3D model through a
text description and an interview.</p>
<p>Four challenges have been executed through a non-reimbursable
Space Act Agreement between NASA and the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers Foundation (ASME) in partnership with
the Future Engineers platform.&nbsp; The challenges were
launched through the Future Engineers website, which
includes educational and 3D design resources necessary to
participate in the challenges.</p>
<p>Space Tools Design Challenge:&nbsp; Students were asked to
use their imagination to design and create a 3D model of a
tool that the astronauts could use and 3D print using the
in-flight 3D printer.<br>
Launch Date:&nbsp; Sept. 21, 2014&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
End Date:&nbsp; Dec. 15, 2014</p>
<p>Space Container Design Challenge: Students were asked to use
their imagination to design and create a 3D model of a
container that astronauts could print using the in-flight 3D
printer and that would be useful for astronauts on current
or future space missions.<br>
Launch Date:&nbsp; May 12, 2015&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
End Date:&nbsp; Aug. 2, 2015</p>
<p>Star Trek Replicator Design Challenge: Conducted in
collaboration with the 50th anniversary of Star Trek and the
replicator technology, students were asked to design a
non-edible, food-related object for astronauts to 3D print
in the year 2050.<br>
Launch Date:&nbsp; Feb. 16, 2016&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
End Date:&nbsp; May 1, 2016</p>
<p>Think Out of the Box Design Challenge: Students were
challenged to design a useful object for astronauts on
future space exploration that can be expanded or assembled
to be larger than the available volume of a 3D printer.<br>
Launch Date:&nbsp; April 16, 2016&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
End Date:&nbsp; Aug. 1, 2016</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The Space Tool Design Challenge received 470 submissions from
two age groups: 5 to 12 years old (junior engineers) and 13
to 19 years old (teen engineers). In the junior group, the
10 semifinalists received a 3D printing $50 gift certificate
to allow entrants to print a design if they had no access to
a 3D printer. The grand-prize winner of the junior group
received a 3D printer for his or her school. The winning
tool from the junior group was the Space Planter, which
allows astronauts to grow plants with limited resources.
&nbsp;&nbsp;The four runner-up contestants in the teen
category received a trip to Los Angeles to visit SpaceX and
Digital Domain, an Oscar winning visual effects studio.&nbsp;
The winner of the teen group designed the Multi-Purpose
Precision Maintenance tool that provides astronauts on the
space station one tool that contains various features such
as a wrench, socket, ruler, wire gauges and wire stripper
without having to carry a number of different tools. The
winner of this challenge will have his design printed on the
International Space Station and discuss his design with
astronauts aboard the station.</p>

<p>The Space Container Design Challenge received 400 submissions
from 36 states across two age groups: 5 to 12 years old
(junior engineers) and 13 to 19 years old (teen engineers).
In the junior group, the 10 semifinalists received a $50 3D
printing gift certificate to allow entrants to print a
design if they had no access to a 3D printer.&nbsp; The four
runner-up contestants received a one-week scholarship to
Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama.&nbsp; The grand-prize
winner received a 3D printer for his or her school and a
private tour of the Space Shuttle Endeavor with an
astronaut. The winning container from the junior group was
the Flower Tea Cage, which uses the surface tension of
liquids in a microgravity environment to allow astronauts to
make tea. The winner of the teen group designed the
ClipCatch, which will allow astronauts on the space station
to clip their fingernails without worrying about the
clippings floating away and potentially becoming harmful
debris.</p>
<p>As of the writing of this case study the Star Trek Replicator
Challenge and the Think Out of the Box Design Challenge are
still underway.</p>

<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Identify Legal
Authority"</strong></p>
<p>The Future Engineers 3D Space Design Challenges were executed
through a non-reimbursable Space Act Agreement via NASA's
Other Transaction Authority (OTA), with the American Society
of Mechanical Engineers Foundation.&nbsp; The National
Aeronautics and Space Act provides NASA with the unique
authority to enter into a wide range of "other
transactions," commonly referred to as Space Act Agreements
(SAAs). The agency enters into SAAs with various partners to
advance NASA mission and program objectives. &nbsp;The SAA
defines liability, intellectual property rights, use of NASA
name and emblems, terms of agreement and responsibilities of
each party. By utilizing a non-reimbursable agreement, each
partner bears the cost of its participation and no funds are
exchanged between the parties.</p>
<p>NASA participation in the challenge included:</p>
<ul>
<li>providing NASA subject matter experts for both technical
and education components of the challenge;
</li>
<li>joint development of outcome metrics;</li>
<li>coordination on promotional opportunities related to the
challenge;
</li>
<li>providing NASA videos and educational resources;</li>
<li>communicating the challenge through NASA educational and
communications networks;
</li>
<li>providing judges and concurrence on the selection of
finalists; and
</li>
<li>providing NASA-unique opportunities to winners, such as
watching their designs printed on the 3D printer aboard
the ISS.
</li>
</ul>
<p>ASME participation in the partnership included:</p>
<ul>
<li>establishing a relationship with the Future Engineers
platform to launch the challenges;
</li>
<li>conducting 3D print design challenges, developing lesson
plans and the challenge website and obtaining necessary
permissions and licenses as required;
</li>
<li>providing subject matter experts; and</li>
<li>providing awards to finalists.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Award Nonmonetary
Incentives"</strong></p>
<p>The success of the Future Engineers 3D Space Design
Challenges can be attributed to the unique assets and
nonmonetary resources that NASA has been able to provide.
NASA and ASME jointly designed each challenge with the
assistance of subject area experts from &nbsp;NASA's In
Space Manufacturing Project, Space Life Science Program,
Crew Tools Office and Advanced Food</p>

<p>Technology Project. In the judging phase, NASA is able to
provide a world-renowned expert in 3D printing in space to
serve throughout the selection of finalists and a NASA
astronaut to serve as a judge during the one-on-one
interviews to determine the winner. In 2014, NASA installed
the first 3D Printing in Zero-G ISS Technology Demonstration
aboard the International Space Station to validate the
capability of utilizing additive manufacturing technology in
space. By working with NASA's In Space Manufacturing
Project, NASA was able to provide access to this one of a
kind facility to print the designs of the grand-prize
winners of the challenges.</p>
<p>Through the ASME partnership, the challenges are able to
provide additional prizes. The 10 semi-finalists from both
age groups in each challenge received a $50 3D printing gift
certificate to allow entrants to print a design if they do
not have access to a 3D printer and the grand-prize winners
of the junior groups received a 3D printer for their school.
One of a kind experiences such as tours of a retired space
shuttle from a NASA astronaut are awarded with ASME covering
costs associated with room, board and transportation.</p>
<p>The 10 finalists in each category are publically recognized
at events, in social media posts, through web features and
at annual meetings by NASA, ASME and partnering
organizations such as CBS Star Trek, California Science
Center and the Intrepid Air, Sea and Space Museum.</p>
<h2>Challenge Type</h2>
<p><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p>The Future Engineers design challenges served as excellent
examples of partnering to launch student-focused challenges
that yielded results to stimulate the development of
STEM-related skills but also yield direct technical benefit
to NASA in terms of innovative approaches to 3D printing in
space.&nbsp; NASA is developing technologies needed for
travel deeper into space than ever before by adapting and
leveraging the rapid evolvement of additive manufacturing
technologies on the ground for in-space needs. Currently
human space travel is dependent on flying everything from
the ground to the space station thus limiting the supply
chain. In order to explore further-out destinations, like
the moon or Mars, that supply chain model isn't feasible.
Additive manufacturing would allow astronauts to respond in
real time, in a sustainable, affordable way, if parts get
lost or broken. Being able to create what you need, when you
need it, on these types of missions is a critical enabler to
sustainable, affordable exploration missions. Having a
workforce with the skill set and creativity needed to design
and build these parts is of utmost importance. Future
Engineers challenges our next generation of explorers to use
their science, technology and engineering skills along with
their creativity to design and create 3D models to solve
real space problems, thus preparing them to fill future
additive manufacturing workforce needs.</p>
<h2>Legal Authority</h2>
<p>This challenge was launched using NASA's Space Act
authority.</p>
