<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Water demand is expected to increase more than 50 percent by
2050, meaning the number of people impacted by water
scarcity will continue to grow. More than 70 percent of
global water use occurs in the food value chain, but often
local ground water is brackish and unsuitable for crop
irrigation. These factors will eventually lead to
detrimental impacts on human health and food production in
developing countries. One way to satisfy future water demand
is to augment traditional water supplies with brackish
groundwater.</p>

<p>In March 2014, USAID partnered with the Bureau of Reclamation
to launch the Desal Prize—the second call for proposals
under the Securing Water for Food Grand Challenge for
Development (SWF GCD). The goal of the Desal Prize was to
incentivize teams to create environmentally sustainable,
small-scale brackish water desalination systems that can
provide potable water for humans and crops in developing
countries.</p>
<p>The Desal Prize offered a unique opportunity for innovators
to prove their technology in a head-to-head competition.
Finalists competed for a total of $200,000 in prize funds
during the competition at the Brackish Groundwater National
Desalination Research Facility in Alamogordo, N.M. The
top-performing technologies were also eligible to receive
another $400,000 in grant funds to implement pilot projects
to showcase their technologies to small, rural farms in a
USAID mission region. A chance to participate in the pilot
program and hone their technologies can also be considered a
nonmonetary incentive for entrants.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the primary goal of the Desal Prize was to
motivate innovators to develop and improve technologies that
are capable of turning dirty, brackish water into clean,
usable water for crops, livestock and human consumption
using only energy from the sun.</p>
<p>USAID partnered with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to run
the Desal Prize. The governments of Sweden, South Africa and
the Netherlands were also partners in the Securing Water for
Food Grand Challenge for Development.</p>
<p>The timeframe for the challenge was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open forum request for information&nbsp;(March – April
2014)
</li>
<li>Application intake and evaluation&nbsp;(June – September
2014)
</li>
<li>Semifinalist announcement&nbsp;(November 2014)</li>
<li>Finalist selection&nbsp;(January 2015)</li>
<li>Head-to-head competition (April 6-12, 2015)</li>
<li>Pilot testing (September 2015 – July 2016)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The Desal Prize attracted more than 60 teams from 29
different countries. Nineteen of these teams were from
developing countries and nearly 90 percent of applicants had
never previously applied for funding from USAID. Five teams
qualified to go to the Brackish Groundwater National
Desalination Research Facility in Alamogordo, N.M., to
showcase their technologies in a head-to-head
competition.</p>
<p>The competition lasted for two days. The goal was to produce
the highest percentage of potable and agriculture-use water
while only using renewable energy. As expected, not
everything went smoothly. There were technical issues that
pushed the contestants to their limits. But in the end, a
collective spirit of collaboration helped the competitors
overcome these obstacles, and the teams had an opportunity
to discuss their work with their peers.</p>
<p>Two teams were selected for their top-performing brackish
water desalination technologies. The team from MIT and Jain
Irrigation Systems was awarded first place for their
photovoltaic-powered electrodialysis reversal system. The
team from UTEP Center for Inland Desalination Systems
finished second with their Zero Discharge Desalination
technology. These two teams were awarded the prize money and
are eligible to receive up to $400,000 in additional grants
to pilot their technologies in field tests.</p>
<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Define the Problem to Be
Solved"</strong></p>
<p>The Desal Prize emphasizes innovation in desalination
technology development and environmental sustainability with
a common goal of creating a technology that serves a dual
purpose to provide water that is safe to drink and water
that is appropriate for agriculture. The Desal Prize was
developed to supply catalytic funding to capture and support
the innovative ideas and new technologies that could have a
significant impact. The Desal Prize challenged innovators
throughout the world to create cost-effective,
energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable
desalination technologies that can provide potable water for
humans as well as water that can be used for crops in
developing countries.</p>
<p>When the SWFF GCD was developed, a state-of-innovation
analysis for desalination was performed.&nbsp; This analysis
confirmed that brackish water desalination was a field in
which technologies are within three to five years of being
commercially available and financial investment into this
field could greatly accelerate this rate.&nbsp; An
independent state-of-innovation analysis by the U.S. Bureau
of Reclamation (USBR) confirmed this finding. Based on a
state-of-innovation/barrier analysis, primary and secondary
research, farmer input and prize design consultation the
prize formulation was determined.</p>
<p>At the early stages of prize design USAID and USBR worked
closely together to determine the state of innovation in
small-scale desalination devices.&nbsp; USAID asked the
Knowledge Services Center of USAID to perform additional
research to validate any findings in this area.&nbsp; This
research was supplemented by primary interviews with
desalination experts in academia, government and industry.&nbsp;
USAID and USBR organized an expert panel discussion at the
2013 International Desalination Workshop in Australia.&nbsp;
The purpose of the discussion was to better understand the
small-scale desalination needs in the developing world.&nbsp;
The discussion provided information about the current state
of innovation and a consensus of expert opinion about
small-scale desalination device performance criteria for
total dissolved solids (TDS) removal, flow rate/volume,
energy requirements and cost. After the workshop USAID and
USBR drafted a report that outlined the current state of
innovation and the rationale for the performance criteria
for the prize.</p>
<p>To better understand the small-scale farming landscape and
end-user needs USAID interviewed experts in rural farming
practices in developing countries.&nbsp; USAID took the lead
in performing end-user analysis. In addition, USAID analyzed
household surveys provided by USAID and the World Bank to
better understand the small-scale-farmer agricultural needs
and farming practices. USAID remained in contact with
several Middle East missions including West Bank/Gaza and
Jordan, and Asia missions including Indonesia, Bangladesh
and Thailand to better understand water-related issues of
interest to the regions.</p>
<p>The Desal Prize used the open-discussion format of the
request for information (RFI) to allow a crowd of diverse
technical backgrounds to fully discuss the questions and the
answers. This approach led to a more thorough understanding
of the potential pitfalls and successes of the prize.&nbsp;
Additionally, the RFI included a section where the crowd
could pose questions they believe to have been overlooked by
the organizers.&nbsp; This RFI was an opportunity for the
desalination community to weigh in on what is needed and
what is possible in the realm of small-scale brackish water
desalination.&nbsp; Although open forum communication was
encouraged, those who wished to submit responses privately
had the ability to do so.</p>
<p>The Desal Prize brought together the brackish water
desalination community with the common goal of creating an
environmentally sustainable technology that serves a dual
purpose to provide water that is safe to drink and water
that is appropriate for crops.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Identify Legal
Authority"</strong><br>
For the Desal Prize, USAID used its assistance authority and
provided progressively greater awards at each stage. Though
it was called a prize and structured as such, USAID used its
assistance authority rather than its prize authority for the
competition and did not limit competitors to U.S.
organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #3: "Estimate Budget and
Resources"</strong><br>
A total of $200,000 in monetary incentives was available
during head-to-head competitions. An additional $400,000 in
grants was available to the top-performing teams to
implement pilot projects to showcase their technologies to
rural farms in a USAID mission region. A chance to
participate in the pilot program and hone their technologies
can also be considered a nonmonetary incentive for entrants.
</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> One full-time USAID staff member
and two part-time USBR staff members were used. USAID
provided a total of $1 million and USBR provided more than
$500,000 for the USAID Desal Prize administration and
awards. The budget figures are inclusive of most staff time
and testing. Former American Association for the Advancement
of Science fellow Jarah Meador's time was not included in
the cost, which would have added an additional $200,000 to
the total.</p>
<p><strong>Prize Management:&nbsp; </strong>The prize was run
in-house at USAID and was hosted on the SWFF GCD website
under a separate tab for "prizes."&nbsp; The prize request
for information, Q&amp;A, request for applications,
application intake and judging occurred on the Chaordix
platform on the SWFF GCD website.&nbsp; Although USAID had
ultimate authority over the day-to-day running of the prize
and all top-level decisions, USBR participated as a host for
the Phase 1 demonstration and served as a technical advisor
for the prize.&nbsp; The roles and responsibilities of USAID
and USBR are described in detail below.</p>
<p><strong>Roles and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p><strong>USAID</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Funded the prize up to $955,000 to cover costs including

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provided any technical sensors/detectors needed for
testing of the devices in the field at the USAID Mission
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #4: "Design the Challenge
Structure"</strong></p>
<p>The Desal prize was designed as a Technical Point solution
prize with a demonstration/competition component. The
demonstrations were conducted in two phases.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> From the total pool of
applicants a panel of experts selected nine
semifinalists (based on responses to questions in an
online applications form) to receive seed funds ($5,000
each) for development of technologies/prototypes to
demonstrate their devices at the Brackish Water
Desalination Testing Facility in Alamogordo, N.M.
</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> The semifinalist teams then
had two months to create prototypes and demonstrate
video proof of life.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Following review of the video submission and operational
documents, the Desal Prize team scheduled a call with each
team lead to discuss the materials and made determinations
about any additional operational considerations. Teams that
did not provide sufficient evidence (via video and
teleconference consultation with the Desal Prize team) of
prototype functionality were not allowed to compete at the
Phase 2 technological demonstration at the Brackish
Groundwater National Research Facility (BGNDRF).</p>
<p>The five top performers (finalists) from this group received
$10,000 each to ship their prototypes to the prize
competition site in New Mexico.</p>
<p>In addition, the semifinalist teams selected to demonstrate
at the BGNDRF were required to submit their slide
presentation file that details the technological approach
and cost analysis. The slide presentation file was sent to
the judging panel and the Desal Prize team to allow a review
of the contents in advance of the demonstration at the
BGNDRF.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> The top two performers were
selected by an expert panel and end users based on a
head-to-head competition amongst the five finalists.
<ul>
<li>Prior to the Phase 2 demonstration, finalists
had a consultation with a firm that specializes
in user-centered design and technological
innovations for the developing world. The
purpose of the consultation was to provide
suggestions of how to improve user-centered
design of the device to perform optimally in the
developing world landscape.
</li>
<li>Based on rigorous performance metrics from the
head-to-head competition, the top two performing
technologies were selected as the winners and
received prize awards of $140,000 for first
place and&nbsp;$60,000 for second place. The
winners received other incentives including
industry mentoring and prototype scaling. An
honorable mention team was also named.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pilot implementation phase:</strong> The teams
with the top performing technologies from the
head-to-head competition were invited to submit
applications to receive grant funds to pilot their
technology in a USAID mission region in a developing
country. Up to $400,000 will be available in total to
support the pilot grant projects. The pilot projects
will be required to demonstrate the same performance
standards as described in the Desal Prize rules
regarding autonomous power by renewable energy, daily
water volume and quality requirements and achievement of
a high level of environmental sustainability.
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #5: "Develop a Communications
Plan"</strong></p>
<p>In addition, the Desal Prize was featured in blog posts and
articles including the Water Desalination Report. The Desal
Prize staff attended conferences and webinars to further
enhance communications efforts.</p>
<p>Communications efforts were led by the USAID Global
Development Lab Office of Communications, with support from
a communications contractor.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #6: "Accept
Solutions"</strong></p>
<p>For the Phase-2 Technological Demonstration, semifinalist
teams were required to submit the following via the platform
found at http://thedesalprize.net:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video proof of existence and functionality of the
prototypes: The purpose of this requirement was to
ensure that the teams were progressing to a prototyping
development level that would enable them to compete at
the BGNDRF.
</li>
<li>A detailed description of the team's operational plan
for testing at the BGNDRF that includes:
</li>
<li>a description of how the system will interface with the
supplied well;
</li>
<li>a general assembly and operational manual, including
basic routine maintenance;
</li>
<li>a safety plan for testing and job hazard analysis; and
</li>
<li>technology packing and shipping plan to return the
innovation home.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The process for accepting solutions to Phase 3 required
participants to ship their technology prototypes to the
demonstration site for testing.&nbsp; The USAID Desal Prize
worked with the Bureau of Land Management to detail the
shipping and receiving process to the BGNDRF.</p>
<p>The semifinalist teams' desalination systems needed to be
delivered to the BGNDRF or be en-route with proof of
shipping submitted to the Desal Prize team. Semifinalists
needed to provide weight, dimensions, quantity and other
relevant content details regarding their technology to the
Desal Prize team. If a team did not provide proof of
shipping to the Desal Prize team, the semifinalist team was
disqualified from competing or winning any prize.&nbsp; If
teams elected to self-transport the technology to the
BGNDRF, they needed to verify their travel plan with the
Desal Prize team in advance. If a semifinalist team's system
did not arrive at the BGNDRF 48 hours prior to the start of
the testing window, the semifinalist team was disqualified
from competing or winning any of the prizes, at the
discretion of the Desal Prize team. In addition, the Desal
Prize required that teams use a complete autonomous
system.</p>
<p>Semifinalist desalination systems must be powered by
renewable energy.&nbsp; The entire autonomous system that
harnesses renewable energy and powers the system must be
present in its entirety at the time of the Phase 2
Technological Demonstration.&nbsp; Teams were not provided
with any electricity to run their systems. Each semifinalist
team was required to communicate (via the operational plan)
and coordinate the shipment and removal of their
desalination system with the BGNDRF staff prior to the end
of the competition. &nbsp;Teams were responsible for
arranging shipment of their system with a local carrier.</p>
<h2>Challenge Type</h2>
<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>
<p>Powering technologies by renewable energy and creating
agricultural-appropriate water was a new and challenging
exercise for all teams. The competition has greatly
accelerated the development of innovative and feasible
desalination technologies for small-holder farmers. The
competition has incentivized desalination innovators to
broaden their market access goals to include developing
countries. All of the teams that participated in the
competition had reasonable plans to greatly reduce cost
during the pilot phase.</p>
<p>The top two performing teams of the competition are led by
women and are from universities. The winning technologies
produce twice as much freshwater as reverse osmosis, reduce
environmental impact and use only renewable energy for
power. For one top team, the competition accelerated
development of its technology from a bench-top prototype to
full scale model in only six months compared with an
estimated two to three years.</p>
<p>The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation proved to be an ideal partner
for the Desal Prize. The performance criteria were designed
to be extremely challenging, yet possible. All teams
overstated their expected technological performance in their
application and presentations to the judges, and only
through a head-to-head competition were the real performance
values of the technologies able to be determined. The
competition allowed learning through failure. Many of the
technologies experienced catastrophic failures, which
allowed identification of critical design flaws that must be
identified in the prototype stage before investment to allow
scale.</p>
<p>Additional outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Desal Prize is on track to provide two-thirds of the
total prize program budget directly to the innovators in
the form of seed funds, prize award and pilot grant
funding.
</li>
<li>The Desal Prize has leveraged $550,000 in in-kind
support from USBR.
</li>
<li>Over 200 local people from Alamogordo attended a public
tour and interacted with the teams.
</li>
<li>The innovators received media placement in high
visibility sources including USA Today, The Boston
Globe, Wired Magazine, CNBC, Bloomberg News and several
media outlets locally and in the innovators' home
regions.
</li>
<li>The BGNDRF has already received several requests for
innovators to utilize their end-user facility for
testing due to increased visibility in the press.
</li>
<li>USBR and USAID were able to combine resources and
funding to achieve a goal that benefits innovators and
farmers in both the United States and developing
countries.
