<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In space exploration, weight is paramount.&nbsp; Reducing
weight sometimes shifts design to more-flexible, inflatable
structures. Such structures are usually lower weight and
have smaller packing footprints than solid structures. Woven
materials have a tendency to stretch under load.
Fabric-based materials, like Vectran and Kevlar, are
applicable to inflatable habitats for crews in orbit, crews
in transit to a destination or crews on the surface of
another body. The creep test (time-lapse investigation of
the deformation of a material under load) is a means of
exploring and characterizing these flexible materials under
tension and at relatively high temperatures. The NASA Strain
Measurement Challenge was created to find a method that
measures strain on Kevlar and Vectran straps with high
differential fiber movement at temperatures from 25 to 125
degrees Celsius, performs as well as photogrammetry and
eliminates the twisting and bulging of fibers that occurs in
current techniques.</p>

<p>NASA hoped to attract participants that are difficult to
reach through traditional mechanisms such as Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR), grants, Space Act Agreements
(SAAs), contracts, Requests for Proposals (RFPs), etc. The
challenge platform approach allowed NASA access to a
globally dispersed and diverse solver network.</p>
<p>The challenge was posted on Oct. 25, 2012, and remained open
until Jan. 2, 2013. There was a potential $20,000 award
associated with this challenge.&nbsp; However, all solvers
who submitted a solution received feedback from NASA subject
matter experts.</p>
<p>NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) pursued this challenge
working with NASA's Center of Excellence for Collaborative
Innovation (CoECI).&nbsp; CoECI facilitates the process for
the challenge owners, monitors challenge progress, provides
guidance where required and will add any specific lessons
learned to its developing knowledge base.&nbsp; CoECI also
is responsible for overall contract management.&nbsp; The
prize was run as an InnoCentive Theoretical Challenge
through NASA's contract with InnoCentive. InnoCentive
conducted the challenge including facilitating completion of
the challenge draft, posting of the challenge on the
platform and the initial review and submittal of the solver
solutions to NASA.&nbsp; InnoCentive also provided the due
diligence and intellectual property (IP) transfer to NASA
.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In just over two months, 347 potential solvers from more than
40 countries looked at the problem and generated 71
solutions from 19 different countries. Three winning
solutions that were similar in approach were awarded.&nbsp;
Two solutions were from the United States and one was from
Serbia. The winning solutions suggested adding a strip of
elastomeric material (a rubber strap) along with the woven
strap in the test jig. The measurements are then taken off
of the rubber strap and correlated back to the woven strap.
The solution was extremely elegant, simple and
repeatable.</p>
<p><strong>Areas of Excellence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Verify Winners"</strong>
</p>
<p>Challenges launched by CoECI through its contracts with
crowdsourcing companies are launched as procurements, and
the execution of the challenge and all its steps are the
responsibility of the contractor.&nbsp; In this particular
instance, InnoCentive used its standard verification process
to ensure the individuals who were selected as winners by
the NASA evaluation team met the eligibility criteria
required to pay them.&nbsp; Once challenge winners are
selected, InnoCentive requires individuals, whether
participating as an individual or as part of a team, to
complete extensive paperwork that verifies their eligibility
to receive awards and also addresses the IP licensing
aspects of the competition.&nbsp; This is the contractor's
responsibility, and as a result the government is provided
with only the best solutions that meet the requirements as
specified in the challenge.&nbsp; The government's time
spent evaluating solutions is also greatly reduced.
Additionally, the contractor has the responsibility of
handling all IP negotiations.&nbsp; For this particular
challenge, the government received an unlimited license to
use the winning techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Document the
Challenge"</strong></p>
<p>As part of its standard process, InnoCentive conducts a
close-out interview with challenge owners to evaluate the
overall response to the challenge process as well as
InnoCentive's performance so it can understand and respond
to feedback as required.&nbsp; For the purposes of CoECI
challenges, InnoCentive updated the close-out interview to
include questions of specific interest to CoECI as it
continued to mature the use of this process.&nbsp; The
interview includes a general description of the challenge
and highlights the winners and their specific solutions.&nbsp;
The interview is comprised of questions in the following
areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>general questions associated with how long the problem
had been worked on before becoming a challenge; specific
questions about working with InnoCentive and with the
NASA team; questions about the evaluation and selection
process; questions about the level of time and people
required to support
</li>
<li>results questions associated with the outcome of the
challenge
</li>
<li>process questions specific to all aspects of the
challenge execution process
</li>
</ul>
<p>These close-out interviews have been instrumental to CoECI's
ability to better execute challenges and prepare new
challenge owners for the experience.&nbsp; The CoECI team
has learned something from every one it has conducted,
primarily in the area of better understanding how to support
a first-time challenge owner.</p>
<h2>Challenge Type</h2>
<p><strong>Ideas</strong></p>
<p>Under the InnoCentive construct the Strain Measurement
Challenge was a theoretical design challenge which requires
a more detailed engineering design as part of the solution
submission.&nbsp; This effort was perfect for this challenge
type because the team had been working on the problem for
over three years when they were given the opportunity to
launch it as a public competition through the InnoCentive
contract.&nbsp; The team was, like so many technical teams,
resource constrained and had not had the opportunity to
assign the level of resources required to find an internal
solution to the problem.&nbsp; One of the lessons learned
from this challenge, however, was that CoECI needed to
improve the first time challenge owner's level of time
commitment required to launch an external crowdsourced
competition.&nbsp; It does require a resource investment,
particularly in the evaluation phase.&nbsp; In the end, the
team members were extremely pleased with the solutions they
received and stated that the solutions provided were so
simple and so elegant they were surprised they had not
thought of them already.</p>
