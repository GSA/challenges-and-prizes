<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In 2013, NCI in partnership with the Center for Advancing
Innovation (CAI) conceived the idea to create a startup
challenge as a strategy to move promising, early-stage
National Institute of Health (NIH) technologies to the
market. Later that year, NCI, CAI and a philanthropic
partner, the Avon Foundation for Women, launched the Breast
Cancer Startup Challenge (BCSC), a first-of-a-kind,
international university-based competition. The idea arose
from the need to address a fundamental problem: NCI
technologies are typically very early stage, and there is a
need to find partners to help develop them. However, the
potential partners—biomedical companies—are reluctant to
form partnerships around early-stage discoveries because of
lengthy developmental timelines and high financial risk.</p>
<p>In creating the BCSC, nine emerging breast-cancer-related
technologies were selected from the NCI patent portfolio,
and one technology from the Avon Foundation for Women
Grantee portfolio, with the primary goals of bringing them
to market and stimulating the formation of startup
businesses. The BCSC was one of the first competitions to
focus on the creation of startups and is an innovative
approach to licensing emerging federal technology and moving
it to market. In addition to helping advance development and
commercialization of multiple NCI inventions, the BCSC
created a new model that can be applied to advance other
federal technologies. Based on the BCSC framework, NIH has
since launched the Neuro Startup Challenge and the
Nanotechnology Startup Challenge.</p>

<p>The primary goal of the BCSC was to accelerate the
development and commercialization of emerging breast cancer
technology by designing a new competition that would result
in the creation of startup companies. Because of the long,
complex developmental timelines associated with biomedical
technologies, blazing new ways for invention development is
needed to meet the agency mission. The creation of BCSC was
a way to address that; it provided another option and an
additional way to find partners who can develop and
commercialize potentially life-saving technology.</p>
<p>While a total of $50,000 in cash prizes were awarded to the
10 winning teams, the larger incentive was the opportunity
to create a startup company around a promising NIH
invention, and the opportunity to work with NIH and the CAI
to further a business plan and develop early-stage breast
cancer technologies.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Notable results include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The challenge advanced development and commercialization
of nine breast-cancer-related technologies from NCI and
one from the Avon Foundation Grantee portfolio. Ten
winners and two finalists were announced in March 2014.
As of November 2015, three of these startups are active
and viable. The startups formed as a result of the BCSC
have created jobs and have the potential to stimulate
economic development.
</li>
<li>The BCSC provided an excellent educational platform to
help postdoctoral and graduate students learn the
"business of science," and motivate and train the next
generation to meet NIH's mission.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The challenge increased the likelihood of moving
promising NIH inventions to the market where they can
have a positive impact on public health.
</li>
<li>The BCSC established collaboration between the best
minds and ideas from the federal, private, academic and
entrepreneurial arenas to focus on the development and
commercialization of federal inventions. It has served
as a platform for crowdsourcing talent for startups and
venture philanthropy.
</li>
<li>The challenge created a new model to help advance other
federal inventions. The BCSC framework was refined and
used to launch the Neuro Startup Challenge in 2014 and
the Nanotechnology Startup Challenge in October 2015.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Build a Team"</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2013, NCI entered into a Partnership Intermediary
Agreement (PIA) with CAI, a nonprofit, to evaluate and offer
recommendations to help evaluate, market and commercialize
the NCI patent portfolio. An outcome of that effort was the
idea to create a business and startup challenge to help move
certain technologies forward. Breast cancer was selected as
the focus of the challenge. CAI was already working with the
Avon Foundation for Women, and a three-way collaboration
agreement was developed to implement the challenge by NCI,
CAI and The Avon Foundation for Women.</p>
<p>Each partner and member of the team played a crucial role in
the launch and execution of this challenge<br>
NCI advocated for the challenge by identifying and engaging
multiple internal (federal) stakeholders early in the design
process and obtaining their support before moving forward.
This was a crucial, necessary and time-consuming effort;
without the input and support of the key stakeholders, the
challenge likely would have never gotten off the ground.
Leading this effort, the project champion from the NCI
Technology Transfer Center (TTC) sought feedback from NCI
senior leadership (on the overall program), TTC staff (about
design and technologies) and NCI's offices of communications
and legal counsel.</p>
<p>NCI analyzed multiple inventions from its portfolio and
selected technologies ideally suited for the challenge. This
included engaging the NIH Office of Technology Transfer to
analyze information on the patents and likelihood of
licensing the inventions.</p>
<p>NCI reached out to Principal Inventors (PIs) with
technologies proposed for the challenge to assess the
inventor's willingness to participate in the new program and
managed all interactions with PIs with inventions selected
for the challenge. NCI scientists participated in the
challenge by answering questions about their technologies in
two webinars with the teams.</p>
<p>NCI also negotiated and put into place all the needed
collaboration agreements to facilitate the challenge;
developed messages and communications about the BCSC for
internal audiences; worked with CAI to write external
communications about the BCSC; and worked with the NCI press
office to have those external communications reviewed and
approved.</p>
<p>CAI negotiated and put into place the needed collaboration
agreements to facilitate the challenge with Avon Foundation
for Women, as well as sought a philanthropic partner to fund
the challenge and managed all interactions with that
partner. The center also created a proposal and pitched the
challenge from the Avon Foundation for Women board of
directors to raise money to pay for the challenge.</p>
<p>CAI conceived the initial design and collaborated with NCI to
refine details of the challenge timelines, criteria, etc.
The center developed and implemented a stakeholder
engagement plan to entice entrepreneurs and university
students to form teams and enter the competition. This
required massive amounts of outreach to create awareness
about and update the challenge model based on inputs. CAI
managed all interactions with the teams entering the
challenge and all interactions with the winning teams and
startups at the conclusion of the challenge. This meant
ensuring that teams met predetermined criteria to enter,
managing the submission process and facilitating "live pitch
sessions" by the competing teams.</p>
<p>CAI analyzed the NCI patent portfolio and provided input on
inventions that would be suitable for the challenge given
their commercial viability and most optimal
commercialization path (being a startup). CAI also
established a panel of qualified judges, mentors and
advisors and managed the judging process.</p>
<p>Finally, the center also was instrumental in developing
content on a variety of fronts, from the creation of
training curriculum and course materials to the production
of press releases and social media posts.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Design the Challenge
Structure"</strong></p>
<p>The BCSC is a novel way to address a fundamental problem,
focusing on creating startup companies to help develop and
commercialize particular inventions rather than seeking out
large commercial partners unwilling to invest at an early
stage. CAI and NCI partnered to analyze the NCI patent
portfolio. They selected nine promising
breast-cancer-related technologies suitable for
commercialization by startup companies.</p>
<p>Together NCI and CAI designed the framework for a startup
competition targeted to university students. The framework
included specific and strict criteria to enter the
challenge. For instance, in order for a team to compete, it
was required to form a multi-disciplinary team that included
at least one seasoned entrepreneur, and students majoring in
business, legal, medicine, science and, in certain cases,
engineering or computer science. Teams averaged 10 members
and typically included mentors and advisors who were
industry leaders, venture capitalists, foundation
executives, subject matter experts and academics.</p>
<p>The challenge framework was designed to cover three phases.
Teams entered in the first phase.&nbsp; In the second phase,
teams were tasked with presenting a live, five-minute sales
pitch to a panel of judges and with creating business plans
to develop and commercialize NIH inventions.&nbsp; In the
third phase, the 12 BCSC winners and finalists incorporated
their startups, began to raise funding and negotiated with
the NIH Office of Technology Transfer to&nbsp;receive&nbsp;licenses
to the technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #3: "Develop a Communications
Plan"</strong></p>
<p>CAI, working with NCI, took the lead in developing and
executing the communications plan for the BCSC. It was
developed and executed against a comprehensive stakeholder
engagement plan to engage all members of the ecosystem at
every step in the challenge. This included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding partners—both non-dilutive funders (e.g.,
economic development organizations and foundations) and
venture funders (e.g., angel and series A, including
venture capital organizations, industry venture groups,
economic development organizations and venture-oriented
foundations)
</li>
<li>Challenge participants—serial entrepreneurs to serve as
mentors, judges and advisors for the teams; experts from
academia and government and key opinion leaders;
industry partners (e.g., licensing and
research-and-development groups from large pharma);
associations for additional resources (e.g., industry
reports); other business plan and startup challenges to
create a compounding effect (and also potential
competitors); universities; patent advocacy groups to
help spread the word; and other ecosystem channels
(e.g., Biotechnology Industry Organization, Association
of University Technology Managers, etc.)
</li>
<li>Post-challenge engagement—incubators (for space),
accelerators (for ongoing mentoring) and other startup
challenges
</li>
</ul>
<p>The communications plan also included crowdsourcing
world-class mentors, advisors and judges to supplement the
core challenge team to build capacity throughout the
challenge. For example, CAI recruited:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elaine Jones, head of venture from Pfizer</li>
<li>Reinhard Ambrose, head of venture from Novartis</li>
<li>Scott Weiner, partner from Pappas Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #4: "Prepare to
Announce"</strong></p>
<p>In preparation to launch the BCSC, CAI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developed a comprehensive stakeholder engagement plan
</li>
<li>Created a soft launch by engaging 385 people via
telephone to gain input on the challenge design,
including but not limited to timeline, criteria, team
formation, etc.
</li>
<li>Designed the logo for the challenge</li>
<li>Put out a press release</li>
<li>Created social media handles and posted everywhere based
on topics like inventions, new judges, new teams in the
challenge, challenge results, challenge timings, etc.
</li>
<li>Developed a website with all stages, directions and
criteria
</li>
<li>Created a confidential disclosure agreement and other
forms required for the challenge
</li>
<li>Hosted webinars on the challenge</li>
<li>Provided cell phone numbers of the CAI team to actively
engage possible teams and answer questions
</li>
<li>Developed email templates for judges, advisors and
mentors; potential teams; etc.
</li>
<li>Created a poster, flyer and other deck materials for
people to use
</li>
<li>Hosted weekly team meetings to review communications
</li>
<li>For its internal communications, NCI met with inventors
to ensure they were comfortable with their invention
being part of the challenge. The institute also
developed invention overviews and had inventors review
these to gain their input.
</li>
<li>To support the announcement and launch, the challenge
team developed guiding principles on how communications
could be developed and deployed. The team also created
standard wording that could be used.
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #5: "Document Metrics, Results
and Outcomes"</strong></p>
<p>For in-Challenge metrics, interested participants were
tracked by way of the entry forms that they were required to
complete in order to register for Phase 1 of the Challenge.
The entry forms included confidential disclosure agreement
forms, letter of intent forms and the resumes that they were
required to provide. As the phases progressed, we also
required teams accepted to continuously update CAI on any
additions and subtractions to their teams. We captured each
individual's organization, title, geographic location, years
of experience and working discipline.&nbsp; We were able to
convert these answers into metrics for the challenge.<br>
Key metrics from Phase I show the sheer number and diversity
of participants:</p>
<ul>
<li>46 teams comprised of 476 people with more than 4,000
years of experience
</li>
<li>86 universities represented</li>
<li>20 percent of participants were from outside of the
United States
</li>
<li>18 percent of participants were women</li>
</ul>
<p>CAI also obtains metrics for the startups and teams after
Phase 2 through a number of auditing methods. For example,
CAI sends out periodic feedback forms asking the startups
for a feedback about the status of licensing the technology
from NIH, incorporating of their startup company, the status
of their team structure and progress with obtaining funding.
Based on lessons learned from the BCSC, CAI has also
developed a new "Founder's Agreement."&nbsp; The agreement
outlines requirements of challenge winners, including
requirements to provide status updates to CAI and to work
closely with the CAI team to track their progress.</p>
<p>Through these follow-up methods, we have found that the
challenge resulted in:</p>
<ul>
<li>11 startups;</li>
<li>eight licensing agreements;</li>
<li>$3 million raised by new companies;</li>
<li>277 trained entrepreneurs; and</li>
<li>three additional startup challenges based on the BCSC
model.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenge Type</h2>
<p><strong>Entrepreneurship</strong></p>
<p>As an example of a great entrepreneurship&nbsp;challenge, the
BCSC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developed a rigorous new paradigm to train the next
generation of scientists on the business of science
</li>
<li>Brought together a diverse set of participants to
consider developing technologies
</li>
<li>Brought together a diverse set of judges and mentors to
provide feedback to the teams as they developed business
plans and pitches
</li>
<li>Established a new model for venture philanthropy,
creating a multiplier effect for grant vehicles—for the
equivalent of one grant for one invention, 10 inventions
could be pushed forward in a highly meaningful way
</li>
<li>Created a new channel for invention commercialization
</li>
<li>Directly supported the <a
