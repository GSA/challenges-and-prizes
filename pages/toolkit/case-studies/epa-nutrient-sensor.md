<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Nutrient pollution is one of the nation's most difficult
environmental challenges. Nutrients, primarily nitrogen and
phosphorus, are essential compounds for functioning
ecosystems and the production of food, fiber and livestock
feed. However, excessive nutrient levels can dramatically
alter aquatic environments and have negative impacts on
human health and the economy. Existing methods for measuring
nutrient loads in water are costly and do not capture the
full complexity of the different forms and how they exist
and move in space and time through aquatic systems.</p>

<p>The Nutrient Sensor Challenge is a market stimulation and
innovation effort to accelerate the development, adoption
and use of affordable, reliable and accurate nitrate and
phosphate sensors. The goal is for sensors developed through
the challenge to be accurate, easy to use in
maintenance-free deployments of up to three months, less
than $5,000 to purchase and commercially available in 2017.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there was not a monetary prize purse
for this challenge, competitors have access to testing
facilities, the benefit of market stimulation and
recognition, as well extensive third-party sensor
evaluations. The organizers chose a prize competition to
bring attention to the issue, identify innovative approaches
from outside the typical disciplines, interact closely with
collaborators and provide nonmonetary benefits to
participants for their efforts in this market stimulation
challenge. This challenge has agency collaborators,
collectively known as the Challenging Nutrients Coalition,
which include EPA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In
addition to federal collaborators, the Challenging Nutrients
Coalition also partners with the Everglades Foundation,
Tulane University, Partnership on Technology Innovation and
the Environment (PTIE) and the U.S. Integrated Ocean
Observing System (IOOS). NOAA is supporting the
implementation of this prize competition through a
cooperative agreement with the Alliance for Coastal
Technologies (ACT).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The Nutrient Sensor Challenge was launched in December 2014.
Prior to the launch extensive effort went into understanding
and documenting the requirements of users of the potential
sensors. The effort included a workshop that convened users
and manufacturers to discuss the proposed sensor
requirements that formed the basis for the challenge. Phase
1 of the Nutrient Sensor Challenge provided the opportunity
for winning teams to participate in no-risk beta testing of
the sensors. Additionally, the Nutrient Sensor Challenge
hosted a highly successful Challenge Summit in Washington,
D.C., where Phase 1 participants gathered to learn, network
and demonstrate their abilities. The summit was an
invaluable opportunity for the competitors and included a
number of speakers presenting on topics including market
opportunities, commercialization strategies and the future
of environmental data. No-risk beta testing served as a
resource to enhance the ability of all registered
participants to prepare for the final challenge verification
testing in 2016. Beta testing was conducted at three sites:
the Chesapeake Bay, Huron River and coast of Hawaii.
Following beta testing there was a request for additional
information regarding the technologies. Participants had to
demonstrate that the instruments fit within the scope and
fundamental goals of the Nutrient Sensor Challenge, were
based on sound scientific and technical principles and
demonstrated a maturity or technology readiness level
appropriate for independent verification testing and the
ability to meeting cost targets.</p>
<p>The protocol workshop was held in fiscal year 2016, and final
field verification testing began in May 2016. Final
verification reports will be published and winners announced
in December 2016.</p>
<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Prioritize Goals and
Outcomes"</strong></p>
<p>In November 2013, the Challenging Nutrient Coalition convened
a "visioneering" meeting of experts in the field of nutrient
management. At that meeting two priorities were identified:
the need for more and better information through monitoring
and the need to engage communities and incentivize behaviors
and decisions at a watershed scale. After much research and
consideration the first priority was addressed through a
challenge to accelerate the development of affordable
nutrient sensors that could provide better data and
information. Extensive work was done to understand user
goals and needs and in September 2014 a workshopesired
performance parameters and usability requirements for the
next generation of aquatic nutrient sensors. Stakeholders
and users at the meeting included federal agencies (USDA,
USGS, NOAA-IOOS, NIST and EPA), nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), university labs, start-ups and a
number of other early developers. These developers and users
discussed the state of technology and options for lowering
costs. End-users articulated acceptable trade-offs between
costs and limits of detection, accuracy, precision, and
deployment length and environment. These meetings were a
critical step in identifying and prioritizing goals and
desired outcomes of the first phases of the Nutrient Sensor
Challenge. The goals for the challenge were to encourage the
development and marketing of instruments with technology
specifications that included precision, ease-of-use,
accuracy, deployment time and cost.</p>
<p>Sensor targets were identified through extensive input from
regional and state nutrient initiatives, federal agencies,
NGOs, academia, industry, state associations and
international groups. The goal of this effort was to obtain
organization-specific information on the number and type of
sensors that users in the research, monitoring and
regulatory community currently use and would be willing to
purchase if sensors met the challenge specifications. This
provided extensive insight into the state of technology,
cost, potential market sizes and incentives.</p>
<p>The second priority from the visioneering meeting could not
be implemented until there were sufficient data available.
It was contingent on the success of the Nutrient Sensor
Challenge to make available sensors that would produce
needed data to inform actions and decisions at a community
level.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Build a Team"</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2013, the White House Office of Science and Technology
Policy convened a group of federal</p>

<p>agencies and NGOs to seek innovative ways to address
pollution caused by excess nitrogen and phosphorus in water.
This loose, informal coalition is known as the Challenging
Nutrients Coalition. To date, this coalition consists of
EPA, USDA, NOAA-IOOS, NIST, USGS, the Everglades Foundation,
Tulane University and the Partnership on Technology
Innovation and Environment. This coalition is working to
improve our ability to measure and understand nutrient
pollution and has launched several separate but related
challenges to address nutrient pollution. In addition to the
sensor challenge there have been two challenges addressing
data visualization and a challenge aimed at recycling
nutrients from pork and dairy.</p>
<p>The Nutrient Sensor Challenge has been successful because
this team of agencies and NGOs recognized the complimentary
goals and objectives regarding aquatic nutrient pollution.
EPA has taken the lead role for convening and providing
direction for this specific challenge, but it is important
to note that there is ownership and commitment from across
the team. NOAA, with support from EPA and USGS, has taken
the lead for the testing and evaluation of the sensors
through a NOAA cooperative agreement with the Alliance for
Coastal Technologies (ACT). The coalition keeps in contact
via email and quarterly principal meetings to discuss
successes, needs and future coalition efforts.</p>
<p>EPA has been instrumental in the success of the Challenging
Nutrients Coalition. Denice Shaw from EPA's Office of
Research and Development's Innovation Team is the agency
lead. The Office of Water, Office of General Council, Office
of Environmental Information, Office of Public Affairs and
the Office of the Chief Financial Officers have been
involved from the beginning of this effort. These offices
provide support for legal authority, messaging, outreach,
communication, data and scientific review.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #3: "2.2 Develop Submission
Requirements"</strong></p>
<p>Submission requirements were identified and developed after
extensive outreach and feedback from users and other
stakeholders. This information was gathered over the course
of a year and through a workshop to identify desired
performance parameters and usability requirements after
collecting initial data. Developers discussed the state of
technology and options for lowering costs while end-users
articulated acceptable trade-offs between costs and limits
of detection, accuracy, precision and deployment length and
environment. The gathered information was used to develop
submission requirements. Other requirements pertaining to
process were modeled after previous technology evaluation
protocols and procedures that have been implemented by the
Alliance for Coastal Technology (ACT) and other examples. To
participate in verification testing, competitors agreed to a
set of protocols that ACT provided. All ACT personnel
involved in the verification testing have been properly
trained on sample collection, storage and shipping methods.
ACT staff were also available to assist in the physical
deployment and recovery of all test instruments, but the
challenge participants were responsible for initial set-up
and calibration of their sensors.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #4: "4.3 Award Nonmonetary
Incentives"</strong></p>
<p>The Nutrient Sensor Challenge is a market stimulation
challenge that has been successful providing</p>
<p>numerous nonmonetary incentives. Because resources were not
available to offer a substantial monetary prize,
participants received other incentives, including market
research and reporting, extensive use of social media,
recognition awards and testing. The testing is being
provided to participants in two separate phases of the
competition. Before final verification testing occurs, an
opportunity for beta testing was offered. This gave
competitors free, no-risk testing for their sensor. Beta
testing was offered in a variety of natural environmental
conditions (brackish, marine and freshwater) and used a set
of agreed upon protocols to ensure realistic deployment
scenarios and accurate data. The testing sites were also
chosen due to the partnerships between ACT, the University
of Maryland, the University of Hawaii and the University of
Michigan. These existing relationships meant that
technicians at each location were familiar with ACT
evaluation protocols and had the funding to support the
verification testing.</p>
<p>Also, the extensive market research conducted has served as a
great incentive to the competitors. The knowledge of the
potential post-challenge market has been very valuable. The
coalition is also exploring approaches and strategies
related to current funding policies and regulations that
would encourage and incentivize the use of continuous
monitoring for nutrients.</p>
<h2>Challenge Type</h2>
<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>
<p>At the conclusion of the Nutrient Sensor Challenge,
affordable, reliable and accurate nitrate and orthophosphate
sensors will be commercially available. While this challenge
is aimed at accelerating technology development, because
market stimulation was a primary goal of this challenge, the
design and implementation of the challenge was structured
heavily around market stimulation.</p>
<p>The first event held by the challenge was the Nutrient Sensor
Challenge Summit in August 2015. This was an opportunity for
the 29 registered teams to convene to discuss, learn,
network and demonstrate their abilities. The summit served
as a great meeting point of the technology developers and
the users. The market efforts were emphasized and networking
was encouraged among the attendees. Following the summit,
no-risk beta testing began. This phase of testing was an
opportunity for the teams to take advantage of no-cost,
no-risk laboratory and field testing as an important
milestone towards final verification testing in 2016. Final
verification testing began in May 2016 and will be held in
aquatic ecosystems in three locations – Hawaii, Michigan and
Maryland.</p>
