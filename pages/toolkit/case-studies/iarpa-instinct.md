<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The INSTINCT (Investigating Novel Statistical Techniques
for Identifying Neural Correlates of Trustworthiness)
Challenge called on members of the American public to
develop innovative new algorithms that would help
improve the prediction of individual trustworthiness.
The solvers made use of research conducted by the IARPA
teams during the first phase of the TRUST (Tools for
Recognizing Useful Signals of Trustworthiness) program,
which aimed to improve the understanding and assessment
of trustworthiness under realistic conditions.</p>

<p>The TRUST research resulted in large amounts of neural,
physiological and behavioral data recorded in
experiments in which volunteers decided whether or not
to keep promises that they had made. IARPA suspected
that this dataset might have untapped potential to
predict trustworthiness in individuals. However, it was
unclear which analytic techniques were appropriate to
apply to the data.The INSTINCT Challenge sought
solutions in the form of new feature selection methods
and algorithms that would yield new insights into how to
best analyze the TRUST data and lead to improved
accuracy in recognizing who was trustworthy or not. In
addition, as this was IARPA's first challenge, it sought
to engage new people and communities with the
organization's problem-solving opportunities and provide
lessons for the development of future challenges.</p>
<p>IARPA worked with the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) on
the challenge through a Program Level Agreement (PLA).
AFRL prepared the data set for the challenge and
provided support based on its previous experience with
challenges. The INSTINCT Challenge and data set were
hosted on the InnoCentive prize platform.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The challenge offered $25,000 for the top-performing
algorithm that beat the performance of the baseline
analysis. If other teams beat the baseline, $15,000 was
offered as a second prize, and $10,000 was offered as a
third prize.</p>
<p>One winner was chosen from 39 entries and awarded the
$25,000 first prize. The winning team connected focused
expertise with broader interdisciplinary interests in
neuroscience, data and engineering. The winning
solution, called JEDI MIND (Joint Estimation of
Deception Intent via Multisource Integration of
Neuropsychological Discriminators), improved on IARPA's
baseline data analysis by 15 percent.</p>
<p>The challenge attracted considerable attention. IARPA
continued to receive interest in working with the TRUST
data following the close of the challenge. This has led
to an exploration of new ways to make such data publicly
available in the future. The challenge was also
successful in engaging new communities by increasing
awareness of the high-risk, high-reward research that
falls under IARPA's mission.</p>
<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Build a
Team"</strong></p>
<p>IARPA's internal team included the program manager and
contract support for the TRUST program, out of which the
challenge grew. The AFRL team had been involved with the
program, providing independent test and evaluation.
IARPA also invited government personnel involved with
the creation and implementation of previous federal data
analysis challenges to participate in an advisory
steering committee.&nbsp; The committee provided input
on lessons learned at the start of the INSTINCT design
process, and continued to provide advice and feedback
throughout development and implementation.&nbsp; The
committee included members from NASA, the U.S. Agency
for International Development, National Science
Foundation, Defense Threat Reduction Agency and Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Define Evaluation and
Judging Process"</strong></p>
<p>Evaluation was objective and quantitative.&nbsp;
Participants first created their algorithms using a
training data set which included the
outcomes-to-be-predicted.&nbsp; They then downloaded a
test data set which did not include those outcomes and
submitted their algorithms' outcome predictions.&nbsp;
They could submit up to once per day throughout the open
challenge period, with the 10 highest scores appearing
on a leaderboard.&nbsp; At the end of the open period,
solvers who had created algorithms with performance that
exceeded the threshold could submit their full code with
documentation to the challenge organizers.&nbsp; Solvers
were aware that only those who submitted full code with
documentation would be considered for a prize. AFRL then
evaluated these algorithms using a third, withheld
portion of the data, and performance against this data
set was used to determine challenge winners.</p>
<p>In dividing the data set, AFRL sought to favor the
training set first (40 percent of the full data),
reserved evaluation set second (35 percent) and the
leaderboard set last (25 percent). This weighting
maximized the amount of data in the training set while
retaining a sufficiently large reserved evaluation set
to minimize the possibility that random chance would
produce spuriously high accuracy for a particular
solution. The percentage of the full data set used for
each segment was chosen based on common practices in
machine learning research; the percentages were weighted
to favor the training and final validation sets in order
to maximize training efficacy and validation
accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #3: "Identify Goal and
Outcome Metrics"</strong></p>
<p>The central goal of INSTINCT was to improve prediction of
trustworthiness.</p>
<p>INSTINCT also had special visibility as IARPA's first
challenge, and therefore sought to attract new potential
partners and performers and help them become familiar
with IARPA and IARPA's research opportunities. Outreach
metrics helped measure how well it attained these goals,
and also helped create lessons for future
challenges.</p>
<p>Outreach and engagement goals were measured through
extensive tracking of site visits, registrations,
submissions and referral sitesâ€”IARPA's internal team
made use of Google Analytics for these measures as well
as reported figures from the challenge management
company. These measures suggested that some outreach
efforts exceeded expectations, while others
underperformed.&nbsp; The largest number of visits came
from IARPA's initial outreach push and ongoing Twitter
posts, an e-newsletter ad, an agency-level Facebook post
and the challenge management contractor's own outreach
to its solver pool.&nbsp; A live presentation at a
federal conference for algorithm developers also
resulted in a registration surge.&nbsp; However, banner
ads on a major scientific journal website received a
relatively low click-through rate.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #4: "Accept
Solutions"</strong></p>
<p>Submission requirements varied over the course of the
challenge. The requirements were minimal for the
leaderboard evaluation but increased for participants
whose performance passed the initial threshold. Training
data set data, including the outcomes-to-be-predicted,
were provided for initial creation of algorithms.&nbsp;
In order to evaluate the performance of these algorithms
on test data (no outcomes included), IARPA required only
CSV files (e.g., Excel files), showing the algorithm's
outcome predictions, submitted up to once a day through
a form on the challenge website.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Feedback was provided via a publicly viewable
leaderboard.</p>
<p>At the end of the open period, algorithms with
performance that exceeded a threshold could be submitted
as full code with documentation to the challenge
organizers.&nbsp; These algorithms were then run by the
challenge owners themselves against a third, evaluation
portion of the data, and performance against this data
set was used to determine challenge winners.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #5: "Judge Submissions and
Select Winners"</strong></p>
<p>Predictive performance at both the test and evaluation
stages was calculated using d' (d-prime), a measure that
takes into account both the ability to accurately
predict an outcome of interest (here, trustworthy
behavior) and the ability to avoid incorrectly
indicating such an outcome when it is not present (i.e.,
false alarms).&nbsp; The minimum threshold for a prize
was d' = .7. A d-prime value gives the number of
standard deviations (in a unit normal distribution)
separating two data distributionsâ€”in this case the
distribution of signals associated with the
"trustworthy" and "untrustworthy" outcomes. The goal of
using d' is to equally weight performance with both
trustworthy and untrustworthy predictions, preventing
the appearance of superior performance due to biasing
one type of prediction.&nbsp; This was vital as the base
rate of trustworthy behavior was extremely high, and a
simpler measure of overall accuracy would have given
high ratings to algorithms that simply predicted
trustworthiness for all trials.</p>
<p>The minimum performance threshold was set using a
baseline solution representing current off-the-shelf
techniques as a comparative benchmark.&nbsp; This
solution was developed by the TRUST program's Test and
Evaluation Team at AFRL. In addition to preparing the
data sets for use by solvers, AFRL also created separate
data sets for independent testing and used them to
evaluate the solvers' submitted solutions.</p>
<p>In spite of the purely quantitative evaluation method, a
number of judgment calls were required to implement it.&nbsp;
For example, some algorithms (including the baseline
classifier) were non-deterministic, running based on a
random seed and creating different prediction sets for
every run.&nbsp; For these, AFRL ran each solution 200
times; the median performance and 95-percent confidence
interval were calculated from the resulting d'
distribution. The median performance value was used as
the estimate of solution accuracy for non-deterministic
solutions, as it should be most representative of
generalized accuracy with a new dataset. These
guidelines were shared with solvers.</p>
<p>While the evaluation technique was effective, performance
on the test data set during the open period was not
strongly predictive of final performance.&nbsp; While
eight algorithms passed the threshold on the test data,
most over-fit their solutions to that specific data set,
and only one maintained high performance during the
evaluation period.</p>
<h2>Challenge Type</h2>
<p><strong>Analytics</strong></p>
<p>How do you know if you can trust someone? The INSTINCT
Challenge asked members of the American public to
develop algorithms that improved predictions of
trustworthiness using neural, physiological and
behavioral data recorded during experiments in which
volunteers made high-stakes promises and chose whether
or not to keep them. Answering this question accurately
is essential for society in generalâ€”but particularly so
in the Intelligence Community (IC), where knowing whom
to trust is often vital.</p>
