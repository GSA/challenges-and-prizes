<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This competition was developed by All Children Reading: A
Grand Challenge for Development (ACR GCD), a partnership of
USAID, World Vision (a multinational nongovernmental
organization) and the Australian Government (DFAT).</p>
<p>By 2010, USAID had assessed the reading skills of primary
school children in multiple countries in Asia, Africa and
Latin America and found that a large percentage were not
learning to read or were reading too poorly to use reading
to learn. USAID made a commitment to improve the reading
skills of 100 million children in less developed countries.
An analysis of data from 22 developing countries and 160
language groups revealed that children who had access to
instruction in their mother tongue were significantly more
likely to be enrolled in and attending school, while a lack
of education in a first language was a significant reason
for children dropping out. In addition, multiple studies and
reading acquisition theory supports the need for children to
learn to read first in a language they speak and understand.
One of the main barriers to improving the reading skills of
children is the lack of appropriate and engaging reading
materials in mother-tongue languages, which means children
are unable to practice reading.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">The Enabling Writers Prize

reading materials for early-grade students. (Image

<p>The ACR GCD Enabling Writers Prize Competition aimed to spur
the development of software solutions that would facilitate
the writing of high-quality, mother-tongue reading materials
that were interesting and appropriate for early-grade
students. The prize organizers offered a $100,000 prize for
the best software solution. Solvers were challenged to
develop an easy-to-use, open source software that would
facilitate the writing of materials that were decodable
(includes only letters and sounds that a reader has already
learned) and leveled (written at the vocabulary and reading
difficulty of students in a specific grade). The resulting
software would combine an easy-to-use text generation
software for decodable and leveled materials in multiple
languages and scripts and in the most common publishing
formats.</p>
<p>The competition had two phases: Solvers submitted their
initial software solutions, and then the finalists'
solutions underwent field testing in Cambodia, Jordan,
Ethiopia and Bangladesh. In each country, teams used the
software to write materials in their mother-tongue languages
and then completed a software evaluation based on their
experience.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The competition had 39 registered entrants from the Bahamas,
the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Ghana,
Tanzania, South Africa and Germany.&nbsp; Three finalists
were chosen for the field testing stage and received $12,000
each. A grand prize winner was awarded an additional
$100,000. The three finalists were comprised of two
nonprofits and one small tech startup.</p>
<p>The winning solution, which was developed by <u>SIL
International</u>, supports writing in any language or
alphabetic script. It also provides multiple page layouts,
access to free artwork and downloading in multiple print and
digital formats. The software, <u>Bloom</u><u>,</u> is
unique in two ways: Its simplicity allows individuals with
limited technology skills to use the software without
extensive training, and it provides writers with the ability
to write leveled and decodable materials with pre-set
parameters, enhancing the quality and appropriateness of the
materials. Globally, there is an insufficient supply of
mother-tongue early-grade reading materials. Writing and
publishing books in these languages is an ongoing challenge,
and the Bloom software is a tool that will help make this
process easier for authors in any language.&nbsp; Bloom is
an open source product that is freely available on the web
or for use on computers, and SIL International may develop
it into a commercial product or service in the future.</p>
<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Determine if a Prize Is
Appropriate"</strong></p>
<p>ACR GCD knew that several for-profit companies and nonprofit
organizations had developed online and computer-based
programs that help writers produce supplemental reading
materials, but none of these programs had sufficient
functionality to produce materials in multiple languages and
scripts for early-grade students who were just learning to
read. Choosing one of these providers and paying them to
develop the product might not work, since ACR GCD had no way
of judging which provider was most likely to produce a
product that, at the time, did not exist. The prize
competition produced a large group of innovators willing to
take on the task of developing this new product and caused
them to turn their creative energy to planning on how they
would develop it. The winner of the competition produced a
product that is sufficient for the task and is committed to
continue improving it. In addition, some of the innovators
who did not win are continuing to improve their products to
make them available to the broader international community.
The prize competition ensured that ACR GCD would choose the
best product developer and caused an increase in capacity of
multiple providers that can compete with each other in the
future.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Develop a Communications
Plan"</strong></p>
<p>The Enabling Writers communication plan was focused on
attracting solvers (i.e., potential applicants) for the
competition and future ACR GCD competitions and raising
awareness of ACR GCD. The main target groups were software
developers (individuals and companies), leading tech and
software communities and local entrepreneurs (e.g., software
start-ups and engineers in developing countries).</p>
<p>Marketing activities were primarily conducted by InnoCentive,
a U.K-based "prize" platform provider.&nbsp; To target its
established network of more than 300,000 solvers,
InnoCentive used social media posts on Facebook, Twitter and
LinkedIn; published a "Seeker Spotlight" blog; crafted a
"Writing Made Simple" tagline; designed two Enabling Writers
graphics for social media; created a prize landing page on
its website; and promoted the competition in its weekly
Challenge eBulletin. To reach new networks, InnoCentive
built a database of both international and domestic contacts
(innovation hubs, bloggers and those in the target groups
mentioned above) and sent outreach emails to them, with the
additional request to share the competition with their
networks. Both InnoCentive and the competition
partners—through their local presence and broader
international networks—also disseminated competition
announcements globally to receive applications from as
diverse a problem-solving community as possible. This was
particularly relevant because of the primary utilization of
the software in a low-resource, developing-country context.
To respond to technical and challenge-related inquiries from
solvers, an email address was also set up and managed by
InnoCentive.</p>
<p>The ACR GCD partners promoted the competition through their
individual international networks and also through the ACR
GCD Twitter handle. Twitter content was also provided for
distribution through ACR GCD partners' Twitter handles. The
prize was also promoted on the ACR GCD website and in its
monthly eNewsletter.&nbsp; Additionally, a <a
href="http://allchildrenreading.org/all-children-reading-a-grand-challenge-for-development-launches-100000-prize-competition-for-book-writing-software/">press
release</a> was released by ACR GCD and InnoCentive at
the launch and <a
href="http://allchildrenreading.org/sil-international-wins-enabling-writers-prize-for-software-solution-to-childrens-book-shortage/">another</a>
was released by ACR GCD at the selection of a winner.&nbsp;
ACR GCD also promoted the competition at conferences and
other events.&nbsp; Since the competition, the software has
been promoted at several conferences and a roll-out plan is
in process.</p>
<p>The competition page received more than 130,000 views from
more than 100 countries, sourcing 39 registrations. Google
Analytics revealed that the top three referrals to the
competition landing page were, by far, direct links,
InnoCentive.com and AllChildrenReading.org.&nbsp; The next
tier included Facebook, Twitter and fundsforngos.com.</p>
<p>As this was ACR GCD's first prize competition, it partnered
with InnoCentive to develop a list of contacts and conduct
several marketing activities to reach new, nontraditional
solvers beyond those that would be attracted through
traditional grant opportunity marketing. This was a
beneficial investment. However, after this first prize, ACR
GCD has built a database of subscribers for its newsletter,
Twitter followers and other relevant contacts/networks and
has now successfully conducted its own prize competition
marketing.</p>
<p>To more clearly inform the results of marketing efforts, it
is recommended that the online application process include a
question about how applicants heard of the challenge. It is
also recommended to list all the marketing mechanisms
employed, as respondents may not remember or may answer
vaguely. For example, respondents may say they learned about
the challenge "at an event" rather than naming the specific
event.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #3: "Document the
Challenge"</strong></p>
<p>The InnoCentive web-based "OmniCompete" platform was chosen
as a portal to manage both applicant and judging feedback.
The InnoCentive platform became a one-stop shop for
reviewing applications and providing scoring of those most
highly ranked. The platform operated around discrete values
that judges would assign to weighted requirements. As each
solution provider was evaluated, both quantifiable points as
well as notes were held within the InnoCentive platform. The
use of a web-based portal for the operational aspects of
collating evaluations, automating notifications to prompt
review in a timely fashion and collecting judging notes
created a trackable and permanent library surrounding the
challenge.</p>
<p>USAID learned that targeted outreach is critically important
for attracting the teams of technology and literacy
specialists who would need to be engaged in software
development, and to ensure that the prize method is
effective in reaching nontraditional implementers. For
example, two of the competitive software submissions came
from organizations that had never received U.S. government
support. Organizers revised the prize call and shaped a list
of frequently asked questions based on questions from
several applicants about what type of open license the
software needed to be provided, what programming languages
should be used and what was meant by leveled and decodable
software.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #4: "Manage
Solutions"</strong></p>
<p>The Bloom software was compared against offerings that arose
from both new literacy projects as well as existing
applications that were internationally available. Bloom
captured the majority of requirements in addition to having
been built upon years of feedback and actual field use in
South America, Asia and Africa. The software competition
spurred applicants, including Bloom software designers, to
add step-by-step functionality to create decodable and
leveled readers, including menus, prompts and guidance for
the users.</p>
<p>The evaluation of Bloom against existing applications
revealed the strengths of the offering in light of the
challenge's requirements and eventual roll-out goals. Given
the breadth of functionality and prior field use, Bloom
offered a discrete feature set that was in line with the ACR
GCD vision of an application for worldwide acceptance and
eventual distribution. In addition to behavioral and
non-behavioral requirements, SIL International proved to be
amenable to quick changes and software adjustments during
and after the challenge.</p>
<p>Directly on the heels of the challenge, a workshop for
literacy authors was conceived and implemented during
February 2016 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with the help of the
local USAID mission. Feedback from this workshop, both
direct and through observation, helped refine the ongoing
concept of a "writer's workshop" to surround the software.
Similar workshops were given at the University Research
Corporation headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, as well as
with an audience of collegiate-level diaspora writers at
Indiana University.</p>
<p>Extending the model of the software from prototype to
workshop platform and beyond, SIL proved to be adaptable and
completely engaged with changing their decades-long business
model and formulating a plan that would cover operating
revenue. It is this plan to move forward with a corporate
and development structure based around support fees that
will enable SIL and implementing partners to continue the
worldwide implementation of Bloom.</p>
<p>The competition reached more than 100 countries, which raised
the profile of ACR GCD as a partnership and U.S. government
agency initiative in the education technology space.
Profiling the Bloom software at events has started a global
discussion and awareness of the need for early-grade reading
materials. Bloom is being promoted for use by governments
and other organizations. It is already being used by World
Vision, Peace Corps, Save the Children, Beyond Access and
other organizations.&nbsp; In addition, the Bloom software
is being introduced to university students in the United
States as a way to encourage U.S. citizens and residents to
write materials for their respective home countries.</p>
<p>A 10-country rollout plan is under development for the Bloom
software. The rollout plan is being administered by
University Research Co., LLC, (URC) under a contract with
USAID's Office of Education and through dedicated funds for
rolling out technologies—such as Bloom—that ACR GCD sources
through its prize competitions. The Bloom software rollout
plan aims to attract groups in developing countries that can
mobilize writers, effectively link with their ministries of
education and ensure materials created are printed and
placed into the hands of early-grade children.&nbsp; USAID
missions and World Vision's national offices have expressed
interest in hosting writers' workshops using the Bloom
software. The first of these workshops was held in January
2016 with more than 30 representatives from Ethiopian
publishing houses, the Ethiopia Ministry of Education and
nongovernmental organizations in attendance.&nbsp; By the
end of the five-day workshop, participants had created 61
books in six different languages. Three types of
supplemental materials were created: read-aloud, decodable
and leveled stories.</p>
<h2>Challenge Type</h2>
<p><strong>Software</strong></p>
<p>With its design as a low-cost, low-bandwidth,
easy-to-navigate and adaptable software solution,&nbsp; the
software developed in this competition, Bloom, will enable
the scalable and sustainable development of local-language
materials for communities and classrooms around the
world.</p>
<h2>Legal Authority</h2>
<p>As a partnership-driven and funded initiative between USAID,
World Vision and the Australian Government, we were able to
use the memorandum of understanding between the three
partners to identify the most appropriate mechanism for
supporting the Enabling Writers' prize call. As such, on
behalf of the ACR GCD partners, World Vision issued the
prize call and funded the award.</p>
