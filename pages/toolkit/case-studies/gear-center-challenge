<h1>GEAR Center Challenge</h1>
<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid #e4e4e4;">Scale new solutions to boldly tackle government's most complex management challenges.</h3>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The federal government is exploring how to better connect to the public, academia, and private industry to solve federal management challenges. One potential path in that pursuit is through a Government Effectiveness Advanced Research (GEAR) Center that uses applied research to improve mission delivery, citizen services, and stewardship of public resources,  as proposed in </span><a href="https://www.performance.gov/GovReform/Reform-and-Reorg-Plan-Final.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivering Government Solutions for the 21st Century: Reform Plan and Reorganization Recommendations.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

</div>
<p>Over the summer of 2019, the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) ran a </span><a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/gear-center-challenge/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">GEAR Center prize competition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Challenge.gov. The competition challenged problem solvers from the public, academia, and industry to build cross-sector, multidisciplinary teams to demonstrate the potential of the GEAR Center. Teams described how they would tackle challenges facing the government as outlined in the </span><a href="https://www.performance.gov/PMA/Presidents_Management_Agenda.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">President's Management Agenda (PMA).</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge's goal was to test the GEAR Center model before investing further. Another goal was to see how the Center could help solve the federal government's current and future challenges.</span></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GSA and OMB ran a successful prize competition on Challenge.gov. Leaders from across federal agences acted as judges, with GSA also tapping subject-matter experts (SMEs) from Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal teams and other government-wide initiatives.</span></p>
<p>Forty-nine eligible GEAR Center project proposals came in from solver teams representing:</p>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">security clearance reform</span></li>
</ul></p>
<p>After an intense three-phase evaluation process, three grand-prize winners and five honorable mentions were selected. The grand-prize winners each received $300,000. There were no case awards for the honorable mentions.</p>
<h3>Grand-Prize Winners</h3>
<p><b>Cybersecurity Workforce Collaboration</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under this solution, a federal neurodiversity cyber workforce will be established to focus on training a particular federal agency to identify, hire, onboard, train, support, and retain neurodiverse individuals for cyber positions. This pilot program will be facilitated by winning team members including George Mason University, Mercyhurst University, Rochester Institute of Technology, University of Maryland, Drexel University, SAP, Specialisterne, DXC Dandelion Program, and the MITRE Corporation.</p>
<p><b>Data for Impact</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, data on federally funded workforce, education, and human services programs are too often held in silos that prevent local, state, and federal agencies from assessing the true impact of their joint service delivery. This solution, a collaboration between SkillSource Group and Third Sector Capital Partners, Inc., strives to improve government use of admininstrative data to measure impact. This team will pilot an approach to integrate currently disparate data that builds on existing state data integration efforts. The team will use many administrative data sources to measure the impact of Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) services for Virginia Opportunity Youth with past involvement with the child welfare and/or criminal justice systems.</p>
<p><b>Data and Evidence for Government and Academic Impact</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project aims to help 250 federal practitioners in Kansas City by customizing an existing training curriculum and recommending how to replicate and scale it in other regions. This collaboration focuses on improving the use of evidence and data by the public sector workforce among the Johns Hopkins University Centers for Civic Impact, and Volcker Alliance's Government-to-University Initiative, and the Mid-America Regional Council.</p>
<h3>Honorable Mentions</h3>

<p><b>Improving Grants Management Using Blockchain Technology</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MITRE Corporation team proposes demonstrating the benefits of a grants management operating model and blockchain-based Distributed Grants Ledger using the joint efforts of private sector technology vendors, state government agencies, universities, and community-based service organizations.</p>
<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<h3>Running a Transparent and Effective Evaluation Process</h3>
<p>The challenge was designed to run through three evaluation phases. This encouraged multiple types of solvers to participate givent the low barrier to entry in their initial submission.</p>
<p>As solver teams progressed through the evaluation process, they provided more detail on their project ideas. While multiple phases required more coordination and judging, they allowed for diverse judging panels who offered multiple perspectives in their evaluations. They also enabled solver teams to address challenge requirements in more manageable segments.</p>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Barriers to access of relevant situational and health data (e.g., electronic health records)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of confidence in data sources</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncertainty about existing, evolving, and emerging biological threats</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Absence of infrastructure, technologies, policies, and knowledge needed to effectively collect and derive insights from data</span></li>
</ul></p>
<p>DHS intends for this work to be the first step in the design of a local and/or national-level system that could enable city-level operators to make critical and proactive decisions based on the most relevant and actionable insights. To form the basis for a proof of concept, the challenge focused on large metropolitan areas such as New York, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Chicago, Boston, and Atlanta.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge launched Oct. 17, 2017. DHS S&amp;T used an interagency agreement with NASA's Center of 
 Excellence for Collaborative Innovation to contract with a third-party prize administrator, Luminary Labs. A <a href="https://www.hiddensignalschallenge.com/">website</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was established that provided access to additional information, newsletters, blogs, and other information about the challenge.</span></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge received 37 submissions from entities, teams, and individuals from academia; artificial intelligence / machine learning and information technology fields; city and federal government; health technology and research fields; and research think tanks.</span></p>

</ul>
<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Design the Challenge Structure"</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Challenge was designed with two stages, the first to attract novel concepts and the second to develop the top concepts into detailed system designs.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the open submissions period, judges selected five finalists based on the criteria, and each finalist was awarded $20,000 in cash prizes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Stage 2, finalists from Stage 1 further developed their concepts with guidance from expert mentors as they competed for an additional $200,000 in cash prizes. At the end of Stage 2, finalists submitted detailed system designs, which described how concepts from Stage 1 could be implemented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Stage 2, the challenge included Virtual Accelerator modules and optional field exercises that encouraged finalists to ground their systems in reality through user research, persona development, and iterative storyboarding. The Virtual Accelerator featured a module that focused entirely on user research, with an expert panel, reading list and hands-on exercises to discuss with mentors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many teams cited the Virtual Accelerator as a critical benefit of the learning experience. In fact, the grand prize winning team said: "The information [the Virtual Accelerator mentors provided] on potential end-user workflows and experiences was incredibly informative. We feel these mentor discussions helped to mature our initial design, with better insights into the variability of the needs of end-users."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the challenge structure accelerated solution development and impact. The sprint development approach proved effective, even in the complex space of biodefense. With eight weeks for concept development and eight weeks for system design development, the challenge proved that the sprint development approach can produce impact (and in many cases, working prototypes) at an accelerated rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The submission requirements and time constraints pushed teams to identify and focus on the most mission-critical elements, leading to a balanced approach for near-term and long-term goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Overall I was impressed by how streamlined the challenge process was and impressed by how much effort and thought the submitters put into this without any money upfront," said one DHS judge.</span></p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Define Evaluation and Judging Process"</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For each stage, the judging process relied on carefully chosen criteria that were weighted equally to emphasize the importance of a balanced approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review panelists and judges were selected to represent a range of expertise relevant to the challenge goals and objectives. Ultimately, a panel of seven judges with expertise in bioinformatics, biological defense, epidemiology, and emergency management helped select the grand prize winner and runner-up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When evaluating Stage 1 entries, review panelists and judges assigned each submission one to five points in each of the six criteria categories (for a total of up to 30 points):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Originality.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Presents a novel approach to the problem, and offers creative solutions and unique hypotheses.</span></li>
<li><b>Impact.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Has the potential to significantly advance current city-level practices and resources for identifying biothreat signals, and simultaneously complements existing resources.</span></li>
<li><b>Feasibility.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Demonstrates significant potential to rapidly detect patterns with a high degree of confidence, ideally within a day of exposure and no longer than ten days from exposure, and uses technically sound methods that are backed by credible supporting evidence.</span></li>
<li><b>Sustainability.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Makes use of freely available and/or low-cost data sources that are readily accessible to city-level operators and DHS on a consistent and long-term basis.</span></li>
<li><b>Scalability.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Has the ability or potential to expand to other geographic areas, or signals indicative of biothreat incidents or other scenarios of concern for homeland security.</span></li>
<li><b>Team.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Demonstrates an appropriate level of experience, commitment, and ability to move from concept to system design within the timeline of the Challenge.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When evaluating Stage 2 entries, judges again assigned each submission one to five points in six criteria categories (for a total of up to 30 points):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Empathy.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Extent to which the system demonstrates an understanding of and is clearly designed to support a city-level and / or national-level end-user's needs, workflow and decision-making process, both day-to-day and in the instance of a public safety emergency.</span></li>
<li><b>Impact. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submission details how the system will measurably advance current city-level and / or national-level practices, as well as how the system will integrate with and complement existing systems and technologies.</span></li>
<li><b>Feasibility. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submission demonstrates a reasonable path for implementation, and a clear method for validating data-driven signals with a high degree of confidence, backed by credible supporting evidence.</span></li>
<li><b>Sustainability. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extent to which the submission illustrates a plan for DHS to maintain consistent long-term access to the system, and adequately addresses potential constraints and potential unintended consequences of the system.</span></li>
<li><b>Scalability.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Offers a plan as to how the system will expand to other geographic areas, to different signal types indicative of biothreat incidents, or to other scenarios of concern for public safety.</span></li>
<li><b>Team. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonstrates commitment and an ability to further advance the system design into a prototype and / or operable system, and also demonstrates significant evolution and improvement of the initial concept over the course of the Virtual Accelerator.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitepapers and system designs were required as discrete assets to encourage a comprehensive plan for both data and operational viability. And the criteria, submission requirements, and design of the Virtual Accelerator for Stage 2 all were designed to encourage finalists to exhibit how they developed systems with a balanced focus on data, technology, and users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge's streamlined submission and evaluation process opened the doors to a wide array of expert solvers representing many disciplines beyond biodefense who can contribute their expertise and technology to the field. In fact, many judges remarked on how impressed they were by the quality of submissions and diversity of submitters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the 37 teams that entered, many other potential solvers showed early interest by visiting the challenge website, registering for webinars and registering on Luminary Lightbox™. All of these audiences could be targeted for future efforts in this space.</span></p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #3: "Execute the Communications Plan"</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The communications and engagement plan for this challenge took into account a variety of audiences including solvers, stakeholders, and news media. While the stats provided below show a significant media footprint, more importantly this challenge opened new channels for direct communication and collaboration with cities across the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge team invited representatives from cities across the country to collaborate in shaping this effort, through invitations to participate in a "Meeting of the Minds," serve on the judging or review panel, or join the Virtual Accelerator as a subject matter expert or mentor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cities joined the product development journey, providing user feedback and testing opportunities. Certain finalist teams stood out for their emphasis on prototyping with cities, collaborating directly with officials on research and preliminary user testing:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">One Health Alert System: This team worked directly with the Cabarrus County Health Alliance to redesign the Daily Disease Report to produce more real-time results. They incorporated learnings from this process in their storyboarding exercise.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-Syndromic Surveillance: This team formed a data use agreement with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and formed a partnership with the New York City Department of Sanitation for early piloting. They used these partnerships for user testing and exhibited their workflows in their system design asset.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the process, city representatives recognized the relevance and expansion potential for these innovations and appreciated the broader applicability of the technology this challenge explored. As such, they welcomed the opportunity for future collaboration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the open submission period in Stage 1, the challenge team sought to drive submissions from innovators and communicate the program's value to the public and stakeholders. This was accomplished through a public press announcement and targeted outreach, solver and influencer activation, and sharing messages through the challenge (e.g., blog and newsletter) and various DHS S&amp;T channels.</span></p>

<h2>Challenge Type: Analytics, Ideas, Software, Technology</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DHS S&amp;T decided to address gaps in biothreat identification through an open innovation challenge to engage a diverse community of solvers and access new thinking; maximize available traditional and non-traditional data resources; and accelerate concept development process to save lives faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solutions sought and received bridged several types, including analytics, ideas, software, and technology. The challenge specifically focused on ideas in these solution areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Producing real-time alerts by prioritizing fast-acting biothreats and using sustainable real-time data streams</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing actionable insights that enable decision makers to launch interventions (or choose not to intervene) with confidence</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detecting abnormal conditions (rather than just specific pathogens), because in some cases general awareness of a biothreat can be enough to intervene and knowledge of the specific pathogen isn't required for an effective early warning</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By starting with concepts and then allowing finalists to further develop those concepts into actual system designs, the challenge set up a natural bridge between ideas and actionable solutions that will carry on past the end of the challenge. As such, it created buy-in and enthusiasm for future collaboration among all those involved, including solvers, subject matter experts, and stakeholders.</span></p>
