<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Each year influenza epidemics occur in the United States
but vary in their timing and intensity. The CDC tracks
influenza activity through nationwide surveillance
systems, but these systems lag behind real-time flu
activity. Infectious disease forecasting, a promising
new approach, could provide a more-timely and
forward-looking tool that predicts rather than monitors
flu activity so that health officials can be more
proactive in their influenza prevention and control
strategies.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">CDC hosted this challenge to
spur innovation in the development of mathematical
and statistical models to predict the timing, peak
and intensity of the influenza season.</p></div>
<p>To better understand influenza forecasts and improve
their usefulness to public health decision-making, CDC
organized the Predict the Influenza Season Challenge, a
competition designed to foster innovation in flu
modeling and prediction. The challenge sought models
which would successfully predict the timing, peak and
intensity of the 2013-2014 flu season using digital data
(e.g., Twitter, Internet search data, web surveys) and
novel methodological techniques. With this challenge,
CDC hoped to encourage exploration into how digital data
can be used to predict flu activity and complement CDC's
routine systems for monitoring flu.Academics, scientists
in private industry and experts in big data participated
in the challenge.&nbsp; Eight teams that completed the
challenge were composed of individuals from multiple
universities, and one team was from a private company.
By hosting this challenge, CDC was able to receive and
evaluate 13 influenza-season forecasts based on a
variety of digital data sources and methodologies—a high
number that stands in contrast to what CDC would have
likely received using more traditional means of outside
engagement.</p>
<p>Challenge goals were to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the utility of influenza forecasts to CDC
and connect forecasts to public health
decision-making
</li>
<li>Increase interest in influenza forecasting and
encourage researchers to utilize novel sources of
digital surveillance data
</li>
<li>Examine the accuracy of influenza forecasts</li>
</ul>
<p>The total cash prize for the Predict the Influenza Season
Challenge was $75,000.</p>
<p>Nonmonetary incentives were also used to motivate
participants. Participating teams were invited to travel
to Atlanta (one member of each team received travel
funds) and present on their methodology and results to
other participating teams and CDC staff. CDC
acknowledged the challenge winner on its website.
Members of participating teams also had the option of
being an author on a peer-reviewed manuscript describing
the challenge, the results&nbsp; and the
conclusions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>This challenge represents the first nationally
coordinated effort to forecast an influenza season in
the United States. Planning for the challenge began in
August 2013, and the challenge was announced November
2013. Sixteen individuals or teams initially registered
for the challenge, 15 entered at least one forecast and
nine submitted at least one forecast every other week
for all four required forecasting milestones. After a
review of the forecasts, the team led by Dr. Jeff
Shaman, an assistant professor in the Department of
Environmental Health Sciences at the Mailman School of
Public Health at Columbia University, was named the
winner on June 18, 2014. Dr. Shaman's submissions stood
out because he determined in real time the reliability
of his forecasts and presented the results in a similar
manner to how a meteorologist provides the chance of
rain for each day's weather forecast. This approach
helped communicate flu forecasting in a way that was
meaningful to both public health officials and the
public.</p>
<p>The results of the challenge indicated that forecasting
has become technically feasible and reasonably accurate
forecasts can be made in the short term. CDC continues
to work with the researchers who participated in the
challenge to forecast subsequent influenza seasons and
determine the best uses of forecasts to inform public
health decision-making. A single cash prize of $75,000
was awarded to the challenge winner.</p>
<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Determine if a Prize
is Appropriate"</strong></p>
<p>By hosting this challenge, CDC was able to create a sense
of urgency and excitement around influenza forecasting,
ignite a sense of competitiveness and receive and
evaluate 13 influenza-season forecasts based on a
variety of digital data sources and methodologies. These
forecasts were submitted by teams that were affiliated
with a diverse set of organizations including
universities and private industry and were from both
highly published investigators and investigators who are
relatively new to the field. The high number of
forecasts received from a diverse set of organizations
and individuals is in contrast to the number of
forecasts that likely would have been received if a more
traditional method of outside engagement, like a
contract or grant, had been used. The challenge
mechanism also allowed CDC to seek solutions for
accurately forecasting influenza season milestones
without having to choose the forecasting methodologies
and allowed CDC to evaluate forecasts for accuracy and
quality prior to awarding of the challenge prize.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Accept
Solutions"</strong></p>
<p>The challenge was data intensive for both the
participating teams and CDC. Teams were required to
submit biweekly forecasts for the start, peak, length
and intensity of the 2013–2014 influenza season from
Dec. 1, 2013 to March 27, 2014. Forecasts were required
for the national level, but teams could also submit up
to 10 additional forecasts for the Health and Human
Service Regions. The selection of the winner for this
challenge was based on an evaluation of the methodology
used to make the forecasts and the accuracy of the
forecasts. Contestant submissions were judged by a panel
of reviewers that included two CDC staff outside the
Influenza Division and one faculty member from a
noncompeting university. Judges scored submissions on a
scale of 0 to 100 points using the following
criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>the strength of the methodology (25 points), which
assessed how clearly the results and uncertainty in
the forecasts were presented and how the data
sources and forecast methodology were described
</li>
<li>the accuracy, timeliness and reliability of the
forecasts for the start, peak week and intensity of
the influenza season (65 points)
</li>
<li>the scope of the geography (U.S. plus one or more
HHS Regions) that the source data represented (10
points)
</li>
</ul>
<p>Up to 50 bonus points were awarded to any contestant that
submitted forecasts for the 10 HHS Regions. Solutions
submitted by the teams varied in format and complexity
as no common standard existed for receiving and
evaluating the accuracy of influenza forecasts, making
comparison and interpretation by the judges difficult.
CDC challenge management worked with the judges to
provide a comprehensive and clear compilation of
individual team forecasts. The challenges in data
management and judging were noted, and standardized
forecasting formats and accuracy assessments were
developed for subsequent challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #3: "Document the
Challenge"</strong></p>
<p>Participating teams were invited to travel to Atlanta to
present on their methodology and results and discuss
lessons learned and the next steps, including
participation in future forecasting challenges.
Participating teams used the opportunity to share
datasets and forecasting methodologies and provided
valuable input that helped shape subsequent forecasting
challenges.</p>
<p>CDC also coordinated a scientific manuscript documenting
the challenge, the results and the lessons learned to
ensure that the information was captured and available
to the public in the open-access, peer reviewed journal
"<a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-016-1669-x">BioMed
Central</a>." Summarizing the challenge in a
scientific manuscript was chosen because authorship
provided an additional incentive to participating teams
and allowed the results and conclusions of the challenge
to be reviewed by experts in the field, increasing the
credibility of the findings.</p>
<h2>Challenge Type</h2>
<p><strong>Analytics</strong></p>
<p>CDC hosted this challenge to spur innovation in the
development of mathematical and statistical models to
predict the timing, peak and intensity of the influenza
season. This challenge required the development of
forecasting models that used open-access data from
existing CDC surveillance systems, including the U.S.
Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network
(ILINet) and Internet-derived data on influenza activity
(e.g., Twitter data, Internet search term data,
Internet-based surveys), which have been shown to have
correlation with influenza activity.</p>
<p>Because of the various data sources utilized, the
challenge encouraged a strong connection between
forecasters, subject matter experts and public health
decision makers. Forecasters needed support
understanding the nuances of CDC's surveillance data
while public health decision makers needed support
understanding the different digital data sources and
forecasting methodologies. This challenge identified a
number of areas that need further research before
forecasting can be routinely incorporated into
decision-making, including the best metrics to assess
forecast accuracy, the best way to communicate forecast
uncertainty and the types of decisions best aided by
forecasts. To help fill these research gaps, CDC has
built upon the success of the original challenge to host
additional challenges to predict subsequent influenza
seasons.</p>
