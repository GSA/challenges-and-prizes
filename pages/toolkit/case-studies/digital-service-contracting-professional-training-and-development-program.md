</div>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">In 2014, the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) set out to transform the way the federal government buys technology to support improved digital experiences for citizens. As a first step, they turned to Challenge.gov and ran a prize competition that produced a pilot training program and the first-ever digital certification for federal contracting officers. The open-source curriculum since continues to evolve to educate digital procurement pioneers across the federal government.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Background</h2>
<!--Body Content Start-->
<p>Digital technology has transformed all aspects of society, including government. Federal agencies must adapt and change the way they serve members of the public who increasingly demand and require digital services.</p>
<p>But technological changes happen at a breakneck pace, and federal procurement practices don&rsquo;t always provide the flexibility required to buy and deliver modern digital services.</p>
<p>In 2014, USDS was established to help improve interactions between citizens and their government. A crucial part of this mission is reshaping how government purchases IT goods and services. OFPP, in conjunction with the release of the Digital Services Playbook, also launched the TechFAR Handbook which described the flexibilities that exist in the FAR specific to implementing digital service strategies.</p>
<p>Strengthening digital expertise in the government and simplifying the digital experiences that citizens and businesses have with government can reduce the risk of failed acquisitions and save taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>USDS set out to create a community of digital contracting experts who could lead the government into a more efficient procurement process and implement strategies to adopt agile software development and human centered design services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To accomplish this, USDS partnered with OFPP in an effort to develop an immersive development and training program to enhance digital services acquisition expertise across the federal government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Digital Service Contracting Professional Training and Development Program prize competition was designed to spur innovation in the training and development of federal contracting professionals who are fundamental to the success of digital service acquisitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through a multi-phased challenge, participants were eligible for prize money up to $360,000. The challenge called for concept white papers, up to three design presentations, and a pilot program developed by the winner of the competition.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>Develop a Digital Service Contracting Professional Training and Development Program for the federal government, which will add a digital service core-plus specialization for contracting professionals under the Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting (FAC-C) Program issued by OFPP.</li>
<li>Foster transformative change in the federal digital service acquisition culture.</li>
<li>Spur innovation in the training and development market for federal contracting professionals who are fundamental to the success of digital service acquisitions.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>By using Challenge.gov, USDS and OFPP were able to elicit feedback from a diverse group, ranging from the public to the private sector.</p>
<p>USDS received 23 submissions during the initial call for concept papers. These came from individuals, training companies, and businesses large and small. Based on specific criteria, they narrowed the pool to three submissions from: GovLoop, Management Concepts, and the team of ICF International &amp; ASI Government.</p>
<p>In the second phase of the challenge, the three finalists presented their program design in oral presentations and a mock classroom sessions. All three finalists offered compelling approaches, detailed solutions, and creative uses of technology and agile instruction methodologies.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the judging panel selected the team of ICF International and ASI Government as the winner to develop and pilot their program. Elements of the winning solution included customized learning paths, self-directed learning, in-classroom guided learning, and a live digital assignment.</p>
<p>The six month pilot period began October 20, 2015. The concept was tested with a cohort of 30 contracting officers representing several federal agencies. These <a href="https://techfarhub.cio.gov/initiatives/ditap-alumni/">participants</a> received the first-ever Digital Service Contracting Officer Core-Plus Certification, establishing them as pioneers in the field of digital services procurement.</p>
<p>The challenge was only the beginning of our efforts to develop digital service and IT expertise for contracting professionals, program managers, and other stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of the challenge and the partnership between USDS and OFPP, there is now a thriving Digital IT Acquisition Professional community (DITAP). The DITAP training and certification program produced by the challenge was run again to prove that it was repeatable. This method of incrementally moving towards a full implementation is championed by the USDS and was demonstrated through success in an additional 30 Contracting Officers being put through the training course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pilots focused on training contract specialists/officers to create a community of informed buyers on the front lines of acquisition. In May of 2018, OFPP published the <a href="https://techfarhub.cio.gov/assets/files/FAC_C_Digital_Services_5-18-18.pdf">Memo</a> which made the FAC- C Digital Service Certification an official core-plus designation. Beginning in 2022, a procurement specialist who has the Certification will be required to be involved digital services acquisitions of $7 million or more.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is for the program to be offered in multiple agencies, by various training providers, or by the Federal Acquisition Institute. USDS and OFPP continue to work with training institutions and companies to continue offering new DITAP Development Program courses.</p>

<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Building a Team</strong></p>
<p>NASA&rsquo;s Center of Excellence for Collaborative Innovation (CoECI) assigns a team member to every challenge launched by one of its crowdsourcing contractors. The CoECI team member serves as the individual responsible for ensuring that a challenge owner has clear expectations and understands their responsibilities to ensure successful challenge execution by the contractor.</p>
<p>The CoECI challenge coordinator also ensures that the contractor responsible for executing the challenge understands the needs and expectations of the organization that owns the challenge. The challenge coordinator essentially functions in a role similar to that of a contracting officer&rsquo;s representative, serving as the intermediary between the government requirements and the crowdsourcing contractor&rsquo;s ability to meet those requirements through application of a particular method of crowdsourcing.</p>
<p>Additionally, roles and responsibilities were defined up front as this challenge involved several concerned participants and stakeholders from NASA and its partners at the Minor Planet Center, PRI, Harvard, and TopCoder. This included an executive steering committee and a technical execution team. While TopCoder was responsible for full execution of the challenge, PRI undertook custodianship of the data under a NASA Space Act Agreement and interacted with the Minor Planet Center. PRI also was instrumental as a technical expert along with NASA and NASA&rsquo;s representative from the Minor Planet Center. Harvard provided contest scoring metrics, and analysis of resulting algorithms.</p>
<p>Those roles were facilitated through an agreed-to status and internal communication plan that was facilitated by the use of TopCoder&rsquo;s instance of Basecamp. Those individuals responsible for technical execution were able to move quickly and with agility while any decisions associated with scope change and cost were brought to the attention of the executive committee. The TopCoder Project Manager and the CoECI Challenge Coordinator worked closely together to facilitate a rapid decision-making process.</p>

<p><strong>Executing the Communications Plan</strong></p>
<p>As with any challenge, the Asteroid Data Hunter communication plan was an essential part of the effective execution of this challenge, particularly given the attention it was receiving through various media outlets. As part of the overall team roles and responsibilities, specific attention was paid to ensuring clear roles and responsibilities associated with external communication for each of the parties involved in the execution of the challenge. Again, this helped to ensure as efficient and effective execution of the communication plan as possible.</p>
<p>The plan also clearly identified the specific products to be produced (e.g., press releases, social media channels) and a schedule for release of those products. Developing an agreed-to hashtag name for social media products provided a significant benefit in coordinating social media efforts from the three parties. All team members had access to the plan in the Basecamp instance set up to support project execution.</p>

<p><strong>Announcing Winners</strong></p>
<p>For challenges executed on the TopCoder platform, focus on the winners is not typically an expected outcome. As a result, focus instead is on the outcome and results of the challenge itself. The ability to announce the launch at the 2014 South by Southwest Festival and return the next year to announce and demonstrate the tangible results of that effort was a considerable boon to the attention brought to the success of this effort. It resulted in coverage in such diverse media outlets as wired.com, govexec.com, theguardian.com, and bbc.co.uk. The Weather Channel also picked up the story and actually modified the video to appeal to its audience during a feature section.</p>

<p><strong>Managing Solutions</strong></p>
<p>This challenge evolved from having an intended outcome of a new open-source algorithm to include the integration of that improved algorithm into a software application easily downloadable to almost any home computer. Once the potential for the successful use of the new application became apparent, PRI acknowledged that it would assume responsibility for maintaining the code. Please note that maintenance of this open-source code was not resource intensive but did provide users a responsible party who could answer questions and continue to monitor the use of the software.</p>
<p>NASA initially provided an easily accessible GitHub site as repository for the open-source code.&nbsp; All the original code is within this GitHub instance. It is maintained by PRI, and the source code is posted there under an Apache 2.0 license.&nbsp; All products from the competition are still available through the NASA GitHub instance. PRI, however, maintains a SourceForge instance where the Mac/Windows/Linus installers&mdash;plus the test data and user guide&mdash;are kept to enable any user access to data to practice with the app. This is maintained by PRI as well.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p><strong>Be clear with partners about who does what when it comes to outreach.</strong></p>
<p>This challenge worked because all stakeholders were on the same page regarding goals, and project management responsibilities were well defined. This carried over to the communications plan. Still, it wasn&rsquo;t crystal clear to PRI from the onset that NASA would be taking the lead on outreach. Once this was cleared up, PRI took on the role of amplifying NASA&rsquo;s communications. This proved critical to the success of the challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Be open and willing to go where your innovators take you.</strong></p>
<p>This project was initiated purely as an algorithm-improvement challenge. It wasn&rsquo;t until it was clear the improvement was going to be significant that the idea was born to use that algorithm as part of a software application that could be used by citizen scientists. Given how well the NASA, PRI, and Topcoder personnel were working together, the second phase fell into place quickly and easily once funding was secured.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a lesson learned as much as a confirmation of the benefits of open innovation. In this case, NASA and its partners adapted based on initial results, and the project morphed into something with even greater reach and utility.</p>

<h2>Challenge Type</h2>
<p><strong>Software and Apps, Analytics, Visualizations, and Algorithms (AVA)</strong></p>
<p>NASA, in partnership with PRI, launched the Asteroid Data Hunter challenge in 2014-2015 to improve the algorithms for image processing of telescopic space imagery to detect asteroids. This challenge was conducted by TopCoder through NASA&rsquo;s contract with Harvard University.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge had over $70,000 in prizes and resulted in an algorithm that was determined to be 15 percent better than current methods in locating asteroids in the main belt. Additionally, the project built the algorithm into a multiplatform downloadable app for use by amateur astronomers.</p>
<p>Given the data set that was available through partnership with PRI, and NASA and PRI&rsquo;s interest in more efficiently sifting through the available data, this was the perfect problem to address with an algorithm challenge. NASA had been experimenting with image-processing algorithms prior to this effort, and that previous experience benefitted the challenge. Also, once the successful algorithm results were known, there was an added goal of making sure that capability could be placed in the hands of both amateurs and professionals.</p>
<p>This is a good example of a problem aptly suited to an algorithm challenge that evolved into an effort to develop an app that was easy to use. The expertise and effort already underway for the algorithm challenge became the perfect scenario for a follow-on software development challenge. Thus, what started as a challenge to generate a specialized scientific tool resulted in a solid application that supports the use of citizen science to support scientific discovery.</p>
