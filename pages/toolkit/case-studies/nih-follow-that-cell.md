<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The NIH Single Cell Analysis Program (SCAP) is searching for
novel, robust methods for analysis of individual cells that
can serve as the basis for predicting alterations in cell
behavior and function over time. The ultimate goal is to
develop new tools and methods that allow time-dependent
measurements at the single cell level in a complex tissue
environment to assess functional changes, provide
information on the health status of a given cell and help
guide diagnosis and therapeutic treatments related to human
disease states. The NIH believes the Follow that Cell
Challenge will stimulate investment from both public and
private sectors in single-cell-analysis research and product
development, which, in turn, could lead to the development
of more sensitive, robust and cost-effective assay
approaches, reagents, tools and devices for basic research
and clinical diagnosis. Through this $500,000 prize
competition, the NIH Single Cell Analysis Program aims to
spur the development of innovative solutions that allow the
research community to "follow that cell."</p>

<p>This challenge was structured in two linked phases. Phase 1,
which required a written solution describing a novel method
for analyzing dynamic states of individual cells that can
serve as the basis for predicting alterations in cell
behavior and function over time, was initiated on Aug. 15,
2014 with prize winners and finalists announced on March 16,
2015. Phase 1 prize winners and finalists were invited to
attend the third annual Single Cell Analysis Investigators
meeting on April 20-21, 2015, at which they presented
posters on their theoretical solutions.</p>
<p>Phase 2, a reduction to practice where solvers will execute
their proposed solutions described in Phase 1 and produce
single cell data in support of a significant biological or
clinical question by measuring changes in a single cell over
time, was open only to Phase 1 prize winners and finalists.
Phase 2 submissions are due by March 30, 2017, and winners
will be announced on July 31, 2017.</p>
<p>InnoCentive, Inc., supported the development, hosting and
marketing of the challenge under contract with NIH.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Phase 1 of the Follow that Cell Challenge is complete, and of
the 33 eligible submissions received, 16 were selected as
Phase 1 finalists, with cash prizes and travel reimbursement
awarded to five solvers totaling $100,000. These finalists
were from a variety of academic disciplines, including
biology, physics, bioengineering, pharmacy, computer
sciences, neurosciences and others. Two of the finalists are
postdoctoral fellows, six are assistant professors, two are
associate professors and six are tenured professors. Six of
the finalists had never received an NIH research grant prior
to the challenge; three had received only one grant.
Submissions were received from institutions across all
regions of the United States.</p>
<p>Each of the submissions from the Phase 1 finalists described
potential advances that, if successful in Phase 2, would
significantly impact research efforts. The top five
(prize-winning) submissions offer highly innovative
solutions that show particular promise and originality. All
proposed solutions from the Phase 1 finalists are posted on
the NIH Single Cell Analysis Program website with an
executive summary of each solution.</p>
<p>NIH practice currently does not allow the use of federal
grant or contract money to support development of solutions.
Organizers did follow up with the Phase 2 solvers and found
that some have secured non-federal funding to support Phase
2; however, other Phase 2 solvers have not yet provided this
information. The organizers do not expect the 16 finalists
to convene again, but the teams are mostly still intact and
working on Phase 2. NIH has requested six-month status
updates and have encouraged the solvers to bring any issues
or problems to the attention of the NIH scientific team.</p>
<p>Phase 2 started in March 2015 and will finish in 2017. Up to
two prizes may be awarded from the total pool of $400,000
for Phase 2, and depending on the scientific assessments by
the Technical Evaluation Panel, the judges will determine
how to allocate the prize pool.</p>
<h2>Areas of Excellence</h2>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Determine If a Prize Is
Appropriate"</strong></p>
<p>Between 2011 and 2012, the NIH issued requests for
information (RFIs) and held two workshops asking the
research community how best to accelerate research in single
cell analysis and to identify key challenges in the area of
single cell research. In response to this public input, the
NIH Single Cell Analysis Program initiated several programs,
including studies to evaluate cellular heterogeneity using
transcriptional profiling of single cells through
cooperative research grants, projects to develop
exceptionally innovative tools and technologies for single
cell analysis through exploratory/developmental grants and
efforts in accelerating the integration and translation of
technologies to characterize biological processes at the
single cell level through research project grants. While
these efforts are already advancing the field of single cell
analysis, a recurring theme from the RFIs and workshops was
the need to conduct multiple tests on a single cell over
time.</p>
<p>At this point, NIH wanted to know if there were other ways to
stimulate efforts from a broader and more diverse community,
and ultimately it was decided to run a challenge to provide
another avenue for seeking innovation. Through this
challenge mechanism NIH was looking for a way to stimulate
fresh ideas and engage individuals or teams from different
backgrounds, perhaps teaming with biologists, to propose new
and creative ways to measure cells in a population over
time.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Estimate Budget and
Resources"</strong></p>
<p>The NIH Single Cell Analysis Program determined, through its
budget development process, to set aside $500,000 and the
necessary administrative costs to develop and announce a
challenge. SCAP decided that the award needed to be robust
enough to attract a large pool of solvers. As with many
cross-organization initiatives, the majority of the work
performed by core staff is in addition to their regular
full-time duties, and the cost of staff time is borne by
their home organization.</p>
<p>The Follow that Cell Challenge was the first purely
scientific challenge run by NIH, and the amount of time and
effort from staff and experts needed to define the problem,
develop evaluation criteria and address all administrative
aspects of eligibility, intellectual property and timeline
was substantially more than initially anticipated.
Additionally, the initial cost of the support contract
increased, due to the decision to structure the Follow that
Cell Challenge as a two-phased challenge and required
InnoCentive, the contractor, to host two separate phases,
adding an additional two-and-a-half years to the
timeline.</p>
<p>The Follow that Cell Challenge was led by the coordinators
for the Single Cell Analysis Program Working Group and
administratively managed by the National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH) Challenge Manager on behalf of the NIH Common
Fund. Additional individual scientific support was provided
by another scientific leader in the Working Group and a
scientific program analyst. InnoCentive, Inc., supported the
development, hosting and marketing of the challenge under
contract with NIH.</p>
<p>A number of other individuals and groups were also critical
to the development and execution of the Follow that Cell
Challenge, including the NIH Challenge Manager, contracting
specialists, NIH Federal Register coordinator, senior
attorneys at the HHS Office of General Counsel, other senior
professional staff at NIMH and NIH and clerical support
staff. NIH leadership was involved in approval and judging,
including the Co-Chairs of the Single Cell Analysis Working
Group; the Director of the Division of Program Coordination,
Planning, and Strategic Initiatives; and the NIH Principal
Deputy Director. Several groups provided advice and
assistance including the SCAP Coordinators, SCAP Challenge
Working Group, Subject Matter Experts, SCAP Working Group,
Technical Evaluation Panel, Program Evaluators, and the
Communications Team.&nbsp; Overall, a total of 80
individuals, or about 2.7 full-time equivalents, contributed
to the Follow that Cell Challenge development and the
execution of Phase 1.</p>
<p>Additional direct costs included the amount of the prize
pools and the contractual cost to InnoCentive, from January
2014 through July 2017, to support development, hosting,
marketing, screening and prize payments for the
challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #3: "Develop Submission
Requirements"</strong></p>
<p>The submission requirements and evaluation criteria for both
phases of the Follow that Cell Challenge were announced in
one Federal Register Notice. Specific instructions for Phase
1 submissions included a description of the proposed
solution with page-length limitations, font size and
margins; a required executive summary; background
information; a state-of-the-art statement; a feasibility
assessment; and a biographical sketch. These were needed for
thoroughness of solution and also for the evaluators and
judges to have uniformity and thereby ensure fairness in the
evaluation. Phase 2, a reduction to practice, also requires
a detailed project description, in addition to the execution
of the solution and information on the quality and
significance of the data. The Federal Register Notice stated
that additional submission requirements would be available
to Phase 2 solvers no later than 30 days after the Phase 1
finalists were announced. &nbsp;NIH held a webinar on April
10, 2015 for all eligible Phase 2 solvers to go over the
requirements as posted in the Federal Register Notice. The
slides from the webinar were posted on the NIH website.
Additionally, the NIH recognizes that some solvers may
encounter challenges or opportunities in Phase 2 that were
not anticipated in the theoretical Phase 1, so Phase 2
submissions allow for documenting and explaining any changes
from the original design in Phase 1. Lastly, NIH has asked
Phase 2 solvers to submit a one-page status update at
six-month intervals; however, since this status report was
not part of the Federal Register Notice, it cannot be a
requirement for Phase 2.</p>
<p>Submissions for Phase 1 of the challenge were evaluated using
specific criteria for:</p>
<ul>
<li>time course measurements;</li>
<li>predictability;</li>
<li>cellular environment;</li>
<li>significance; and</li>
<li>adaptability plus feasibility, throughput and data
content.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase 2 will be evaluated using the same criteria.
Additionally, the Federal Register Notice stated that as
part of the evaluation process for Phase 2, the technical
evaluation panel may request a demonstration of the
technology.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #4: "Complete
Reporting"</strong></p>
<p>The NIH Follow that Cell Challenge has submitted two reports
to be included in the Office of Science and Technology
Policy (OSTP) annual report on the use of the America
COMPETES Act prize authority by agencies. One in fiscal year
2014 when the challenge was announced and the second in
fiscal year 2015 after the completion of Phase 1. A final
annual report will be due upon completion of Phase 2 for the
fiscal year 2017 annual report. Reports are submitted
through HHS to OSTP.</p>
<p>HHS requires a report five days after the selection of prize
awardees and has provided a template. NIH suggests that
challenge managers begin work on the template when the
challenge is being developed and announced. Completing the
template as you work through the challenge makes the final
report much easier. Additionally, HHS compiles annual
individual reports from challenges launched, continuing or
completed in a given fiscal year. The information collected
is used both for the synthesized report sent to OSTP and for
internal strategy on how to provide future support. HHS
requests informal updates a year after a challenge ends to
better understand impacts on both the internal challenge
sponsor and on the problem area.</p>
<p>NIH practice currently does not allow the use of federal
grant or contract money to support development of solutions,
so follow up with Phase 2 solvers was done to determine if
they were able to secure non-federal funding support for
Phase 2. Some Phase 2 solvers have secured non-federal
funding for support of Phase 2, but other Phase 2 solvers
have not provided this information. This information was
included in the OSTP report.</p>
<h2>Challenge Type</h2>
<p><strong>Scientific</strong></p>
<p>Challenges seek to encourage innovation and solicit creative
ideas. Much of the biomedical research supported by the
federal government is through research grants and contracts,
but challenges are a way to solicit additional new ideas
from individuals who may or may not be familiar with the
NIH. Even before the NIH Big Think in 2010, scientists had
been discussing the need for new ideas in single cell
research and specifically the importance of being able to
pinpoint changes in a single cell within a population of
cells. The Follow that Cell Challenge was designed to
stimulate creative ideas from a broad audience with varied
expertise, different backgrounds and different career
stages. The solvers embraced this mechanism of seeking
solutions to a tough problem and offered the following
comments to describe their experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>The challenge generated an increased level of
excitement
</li>
<li>They had fun putting together the proposal</li>
<li>It pushed our thinking</li>
<li>The proposal was easier without having to think about
budget and personnel justification, and they were able
to devote all the thinking to the science
</li>
<li>A challenge offers a novel approach by presenting the
need and asking for solutions without constraints
</li>
<li>It was open to everyone, not just NIH researchers or
funded researchers
</li>
<li>It generated creative ideas</li>
<li>Solvers can submit proposals without strict NIH or NSF
guidelines
</li>
<li>They enjoyed working on the solution</li>
</ul>
<p>One lesson learned: in order to secure government-use
intellectual property (IP) rights, as outlined in the rules
of the Follow that Cell Challenge, agreements between
solvers, employers and the NIH needed to be developed and
signed. While the Phase 1 prize winners and finalists were
announced on the schedule outlined in the Federal Register
Notice, the actual prize payments to solvers could not be
made until the agreements were signed. Agreements took one
month to nearly one full year after the announcements to get
signed, and prize winners were anxious about getting the
promised prize money. All Phase 2 solvers were notified of
the NIH requirement for a signed IP agreement, which should
allow Phase 2 prizes to be awarded in a timely manner. NIH
and HHS staff now plan to attend various meetings of
research administrators to educate and explain challenges to
individuals from the administrative side of the
organization.</p>
