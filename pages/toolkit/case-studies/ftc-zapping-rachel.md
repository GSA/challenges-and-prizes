<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Robocalls—or prerecorded phone messages trying to sell
something—have plagued consumers for years. &nbsp;The vast
majority are illegal and often peddle scams. &nbsp;Although
the FTC has taken aggressive law enforcement actions against
robocallers, these perpetrators exploit technology to mask
their identities and avoid detection. &nbsp;To stem the tide
of robocall harassment, the FTC has unveiled a number of
initiatives to help protect consumers from illegal
robocalls, including issuing public challenges to stimulate
the development of technological solutions that address this
prevalent issue.</p>

<p>Following on the success of its first challenge in 2012, the
FTC held its second robocall contest, Zapping Rachel, at DEF
CON 22, one of the oldest conferences for information
security experts. &nbsp;Zapping Rachel's primary goal was to
develop the next-generation robocall honeypot—information
systems, or a collection of phone lines, that gather data on
robocalls. &nbsp;Robocall honeypots can enhance law
enforcement efforts and advance technological solutions that
combat robocalls, as well as further the general
understanding of robocaller tactics. &nbsp;In addition, the
FTC hoped to gain new insights from information security
experts, engage new partners from the technology community,
stimulate the development of private-sector robocall
solutions and raise public awareness of FTC goals.</p>
<p>The FTC divided Zapping Rachel into three phases, and
contestants could enter one or more phases as individuals or
teams. &nbsp;For phase one, contestants designed a honeypot
that identified inaccurate call detail information (i.e.,
spoofed caller IDs) or categorized incoming phone calls to
identify likely robocalls. &nbsp;For phase two, contestants
identified methods of circumventing a honeypot so that the
honeypot could not collect information about the incoming
calls. &nbsp;For phase three, contestants analyzed data from
a honeypot and developed algorithms that predicted
robocalls.</p>
<p>The FTC awarded a total cash prize of $12,075 divided between
the three phases. &nbsp;The winners of the best solution for
each phase received $3,133.70. &nbsp;For phase three, two
contestants also received the honorable mention prizes of
$1,337 each. &nbsp;All five winning teams or individuals
also received recognition from the FTC. &nbsp;The prize
money came from FTC appropriations, as authorized by the
America COMPETES Reauthorization Act. &nbsp;All solutions
are open-source and the FTC made the winning solutions for
phases one and three available online.</p>
<p>The FTC announced Zapping Rachel on June 16, 2014.&nbsp;
Phase one opened on July 18, 2014, and phases two and three
opened on Aug. 7, 2014.&nbsp; The submission deadlines were
Aug. 8, 2014, for phase one, and Aug. 9, 2014, for phases
two and three.&nbsp; The judging period for all three phases
took place Aug. 8-10, 2014, and winners were announced on
Aug. 28, 2014.</p>
<p>The FTC drew on partner relationships from a diverse array of
experts as it formulated Zapping Rachel. &nbsp;The FTC's
partners included prior Robocall Challenge winner Aaron
Foss's company Telephone Science Corporation and VOIP
service provider Twilio. &nbsp;Aaron Foss partnered with the
FTC on all three phases of Zapping Rachel, including by
providing the means of testing the honeypot submissions for
phase one, creating the honeypot for phase two and providing
the honeypot data for analysis in phase three. &nbsp;Twilio
partnered with the FTC for phases one and two by providing
credit for contestants to use its platform. Both Telephone
Science Corporation and Twilio signed memorandums of
understanding and nondisclosure agreements to formalize the
partnerships.</p>
<p>The Canadian Radio-television Telecommunications Commission,
Federal Communications Commission, the White House, the
General Services Administration and academic advisors also
assisted in providing guidance on designing the challenge.
&nbsp;Moreover, DEF CON 22 organizers provided assistance
with marketing and promotion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Zapping Rachel was a success for many reasons. &nbsp;First,
stakeholders involved in the fight against robocalls
obtained new insights on honeypot design from the
open-source solutions, improving the functionality of
current honeypots. &nbsp;The new insights advance law
enforcement efforts and help further stakeholders'
understanding of robocaller tactics.</p>
<p>Second, private-sector companies developing technical
solutions to combat robocalls have expressed interest in
utilizing the open-source solutions and the new insights to
improve their product designs, thus better protecting
consumers from illegal robocalls.</p>
<p>Third, Zapping Rachel attracted individuals who had not
previously worked on stopping robocalls. For example, many
of the individuals or teams who participated in phase three
did not have any prior experience working on telecom-related
issues. Winners for all three phases are mostly from the
private sector, in industries from telemarketing to computer
games.</p>
<p>Fourth, by holding the contest at DEF CON 22, a conference
attended by roughly 20,000 people, the FTC conducted
effective outreach to a community of information security
experts regarding the purpose of Zapping Rachel, the
robocall problem and the FTC's technological initiatives to
tackle it.</p>
<p>Many DEF CON attendees that did not participate in the
contest were interested in learning more about robocalls and
offered numerous promising ideas to tackle this thorny
issue. &nbsp;Since Zapping Rachel concluded, the FTC has
gained several new partners from DEF CON 22 who are now
working with the FTC and other industry stakeholders through
the London Action Plan International Cybersecurity
Enforcement Network and the Messaging, Malware and Mobile
Anti-Abuse Working Group (M3AAWG) to create solutions to
stop illegal calls, as well as the related topic of
fraudulent caller ID information.</p>
<p>Finally, Zapping Rachel's broad media attention promoted
public awareness of the FTC's technical initiatives. &nbsp;In
particular, the media's interest in the topic gave the
agency an opportunity to convey its consumer education
messages about illegal telemarketing calls to a broad
audience.</p>
<h1>Areas of Excellence</h1>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #1: "Define the Problem to Be
Solved"</strong></p>
<p>After the FTC amended the Telemarketing Sales Rule in 2009 to
prohibit the majority of robocalls, the FTC noticed a steady
rise in the number of consumer complaints it receives on
this issue.&nbsp; The FTC receives more complaints about
robocalls than any other topic, averaging approximately
300,000 consumer complaints per month.&nbsp; To explore the
causes of this consumer frustration, the FTC held a public
meeting—the Robocall Summit—in October 2012, bringing
together industry experts, telecommunications providers,
academics and government regulators.&nbsp; The Robocall
Summit made clear that the convergence of the legacy
telephone system and the internet has given rise to a new
environment where robocallers can blast millions of calls to
consumers at minimal cost, while simultaneously hiding their
identities. The Robocall Summit also explored whether a
technological solution could be developed to attack this
scourge.&nbsp; The FTC concluded the Summit by launching its
first robocall challenge to stimulate private sector
development of call-blocking technologies.</p>
<p>After the success of the <a
href="https://robocall.devpost.com/">first robocall
challenge</a>, the FTC continued working with stakeholders
interested in developing technological solutions through
industry groups such as M3AAWG.&nbsp; One M3AAWG initiative
was the development of robocall honeypots.&nbsp; Although
honeypots are successful tools that have been applied in
other arenas, such as reducing email spam or dealing with
malware, they had not yet been used to combat robocalls.&nbsp;
In 2012, the FTC launched its own robocall honeypot.&nbsp;
To further explore the use of honeypots in combatting
robocalls, the FTC decided to launch its second contest,
Zapping Rachel, and tap into the ingenuity of information
security experts to generate ideas on how to develop the
next-generation robocall honeypot.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #2: "Prepare to
Announce"</strong></p>
<p>In announcing Zapping Rachel, the FTC took several steps.
First, the FTC identified its target audiences and developed
appropriate communication strategies for each audience type.
&nbsp;The audience type ranged from consumers harassed by
robocalls to information security experts attending DEF CON
22. &nbsp;The communication strategies included posting
consumer friendly blog posts and hosting social media chats
to allow potential contestants to ask questions about the
contest. &nbsp;Second, the FTC developed a contestant
friendly website to provide the key pieces of information
with respect to the contest deadlines and events.&nbsp;
Third, the FTC developed promotional materials, graphics and
logos designed to attract DEF CON attendees to participate
in Zapping Rachel or learn more information about the
robocall problem and the FTC's technological initiatives.&nbsp;
The promotional materials included a large banner
advertising the contest, stickers with the contest logo and
website, a 6-foot-tall cutout of Rachel the Robocaller,
infographics on how a robocall works and poster handouts
with background information about Zapping Rachel, the FTC's
law enforcement mission, and the FTC's technical initiatives
on robocalls.&nbsp; Fourth, the FTC worked with DEF CON
organizers to promote Zapping Rachel, including posting a
video of Zapping Rachel on social media during DEF CON 22,
connecting with relevant media outlets and preparing and
launching a PSA over DEF CON radio.&nbsp; Finally, the FTC
worked with GSA to ensure that all relevant contest
materials were posted and available on Challenge.gov.</p>
<p>Throughout each step, the FTC ensured that staff members with
relevant expertise were engaged in every step of formulating
and executing the communication plan, including the contest
project manager and experts in consumer outreach, media
outreach, graphic design, video design and website design.&nbsp;
FTC staff members developed all materials used in the
communication strategies, including the contest website,
graphics for the promotion materials, infographic on
robocalls, poster handouts and the radio PSA.&nbsp; FTC
staff also consulted with the contest judges and other FTC
employees familiar with the DEF CON community on the
appropriate promotional materials to use and their design.&nbsp;
The FTC used outside vendors to create the stickers and
6-foot-tall cutout of Rachel the Robocaller.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #3: "Accept
Solutions"</strong></p>
<p>For each phase, contestants were required to submit source
code and a written description of their proposed solutions.&nbsp;
For phase one, contestants were also required to provide
access to the honeypot and the associated call detail
records from the honeypot.&nbsp; For phase two, contestants
were also required to submit all means necessary for the
judges to replicate the proposed solution.&nbsp; For phase
three, contestants were required to submit an answer key of
the calls they predicted to be robocalls.</p>
<p>Contestants submitted their solutions by email and the
requested documentation as attachments or as links to
accounts on repository hosting services that contained the
solutions.&nbsp; Contestants also provided all necessary
information to access those accounts in a secure manner.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Excellence #4: "Document Metrics, Results
and Outcomes"</strong></p>
<p>In order to track the success of Zapping Rachel, the FTC
defined three clear goals of its contest.&nbsp; First, the
FTC hoped that Zapping Rachel would generate design ideas
for the next-generation robocall honeypot.&nbsp; Second, the
FTC hoped to engage a community of information security
experts that have not yet applied its expertise to the
robocall problem.&nbsp; And third, the FTC hoped to promote
public awareness of the FTC's technical initiatives to fight
robocalls and disseminate consumer education on this
issue.</p>
<p>To measure the success of each of these goals, the FTC kept
track of specific metrics as required by the COMPETES Act.&nbsp;
For example, to ascertain the success of the FTC's first
goal of creating the next-generation robocall honeypot, the
FTC assessed the quality of the submissions and the interest
that industry demonstrated in applying the insights.</p>
<p>To track the success of the FTC's second goal of engaging
information security experts, the FTC gathered metrics
on</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of contestant registrations and submissions
by collecting contestant registration forms;
</li>
<li>the number of individuals that FTC staff spoke with at
DEF CON by tracking materials distributed at DEF CON;
</li>
<li>the number of individuals or companies who have
continued engaging with the FTC through industry groups
such as M3AAWG; and
</li>
<li>the number of individuals who participated in the FTC's
outreach efforts through social media.
</li>
</ul>
<p>FTC staff</p>
<ul>
<li>collected 96 registration forms for all three phases;
</li>
<li>distributed approximately 4,900 promotional materials
(e.g., copies of the official rules, FTC fact sheet,
robocall infographic, contest fliers and contest
stickers);
</li>
<li>gained three new partners who have continued to engage
with the FTC through M3AAWG;
</li>
<li>generated 323,543 impressions from the FTC's 67 tweets;
and
</li>
<li>reached 14,864 people through the FTC's other outreach
efforts on social media.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the FTC contest website received 18,214 unique
page views of the contest homepage, the rules, judging
criteria, FAQs, resources and contest judges.</p>
<p>To determine the success of the FTC's third goal of promoting
public awareness of the robocall problem and the FTC's
initiatives, the FTC tracked</p>
<ul>
<li>metrics such as the number of media outlets who covered
Zapping Rachel;
</li>
<li>the number of individuals who saw the FTC's social media
campaign;
</li>
<li>the number of individuals who visited the Zapping Rachel
website and other consumer blog posts on Zapping Rachel;
and
</li>
<li>the number of individuals who saw the FTC's press
releases regarding Zapping Rachel.
</li>
</ul>
<p>FTC staff spoke with media outlets, including major print
outlets, technology blogs and websites, other widely read
websites, national and local radio and television shows,
regarding the contest that resulted in more than 35 stories
that covered or mentioned the contest.&nbsp; The FTC's press
releases and blog posts received 22,413 unique page
views.</p>
<h2>Challenge Type</h2>
<p><strong>Software</strong></p>
<p>The overall goal of Zapping Rachel was to create the
next-generation robocall honeypot and to tap into the
ingenuity of technologists with information security
expertise.&nbsp; The contest was structured in three phases
that focused on different aspects of building or utilizing a
robocall honeypot including the creation of a honeypot that
could analyze data in real-time, circumvention of a honeypot
to prevent the honeypot from functioning as intended, and
analysis of data from a honeypot.&nbsp; The FTC formulated
Zapping Rachel so that each phase would appeal to solvers
with different skill sets, but the insights of each are
important in developing different aspects of the
next-generation honeypot.&nbsp; Additionally, as
demonstrated by the winners of the contest, solvers did not
need extensive expertise in the telephony industry to
successfully compete in the contest.&nbsp; For example, in
phase three, many of the contestants were individuals with
expertise in data analysis and algorithm development, and
most did not have prior experience dealing with telephony
systems.</p>
