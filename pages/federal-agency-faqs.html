<h3>General Questions About Prize Competitions</h3>
 <details>
  <summary><em><b>What is a prize competition?</b></em></summary>
  <br>
  <p>A prize competition (also referred to as a “challenge,” "prize challenge," "competition," "incentive
prize" or any combination thereof) is a type of project that allows the public to solve challenges
presented by federal agencies and receive awards for the best solutions. The process for running
a prize competition boils down to three steps:</p>
   <ol>
     <li>Agency announces a prize competition and invites the public to solve it.</li>
<li>Participants create and submit solutions to the problem.</li>
<li>Agency evaluates solutions and awards prizes to the best ones.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>This process may sound similar to grants or contracts, but prize competitions differ in small and
significant ways. In grants and contracts, an agency receives proposals to do tasks or research,
chooses one entity to participate and then pays the monetary award incrementally for the work
to be done. In prize competitions, an agency generally selects a winner or winners based on the
work that has been done. In more complex, multi-phase prize competitions, phase winners may be
     selected as each phase ends. In prize competitions, only the winner(s) receives an award.</p>
<p>Unlike contracts which provide detailed specifications of the work that needs to be done, prize
competitions define a smaller set of requirements, which allow participants to bring their
creative solutions. This can be advantageous when a problem can be solved in many different
ways, including ways that the agency is not even aware of. The open innovation approach can
entice participation from those who may not have direct expertise in the problem subject matter
area but can lend expertise from their diverse backgrounds.</p>
</details>
<br>
<details>
  <summary><em><b>Why should my agency sponsor a prize competition?</b></em></summary>
  <br>
  <p>Prize competitions are a great way to spark innovative ideas to address agency challenges. They also offer unique benefits not available through grants or contracts. Specifically, they can:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Lower the barrier to entry for participation and encourage a more diverse pool of
innovators. They open the door to new entrepreneurs who may not have the
necessary background or infrastructure necessary to apply to a federal grant or
contract opportunity.</li>
<li>Allow federal agencies to award only the best results. Contracts and grants are
structured to fund work to be completed in the future. However, prize competitions
are a “pay-for-results” model that award those who best accomplish the results,
rather than efforts to accomplish those results. Awarding only the best solutions
sourced through a competitive process, prize competitions are a proven
pay-for-results model. Attract new talent. Prize competitions create opportunities
for solvers to apply their expertise in a new sector and share their talent(s).</li>
<li>Raise awareness and seek private sector engagement in problem solving and
innovation. When several partners come together to sponsor a prize competition,
they send an important signal regarding the magnitude of the problem and the
federal government’s interest in developing and advancing solutions.</li>
<li>Spur innovation and entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs often face an uphill battle to
secure funding to move from innovative idea to working solution. Prize competitions
make it easier for agencies to nurture private sector entrepreneurs and startups.
Prize competitions allow the federal government to engage leading edge innovators
       and entities in problem solving and innovation.</li>
     </ol>
</details>
<br>
<details>
  <summary><em><b>How long does it take to run a prize competition?</b></em></summary>
  <br>
  <p>The timeline for a prize competition is influenced by a multitude of factors such as partner needs,
budget and staff availability, immediacy of the problem you are addressing, and requirements of
the competition, to name a few. If you're managing your first prize competition and it's fairly
straightforward, allocate at least eight months from discovery and design to awarding winners.
You'll need to extend your expected timeline if the challenge is technically difficult and
participants need significant amounts of time to meet the competition requirements; if you
    incorporate multiple rounds; or if the challenge becomes more administratively complex.</p>
</details>

<br>
<details>
  <summary><em><b>Do all agencies have legal authority to run a prize competition?</b></em></summary>
  <br>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/5116">America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010</a> (COMPETES) provides the statutory
authority for the head of a federal agency to run prize competitions. COMPETES leaves a great
deal of leeway for legislative interpretation and the flexibility to create processes for running
prize competitions. Be sure to check with your leadership, general counsel, budget officers, and,
in some cases, your procurement team to get off on the right foot. In 2017, the authority was
    updated under the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/3084/text">American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017</a> (AICA).</p>
<p>Not all agencies use COMPETES as the legal authority to run their prize competitions; NASA, for
example, has used the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and National Aeronautics and Space
Administration Act of 2005. Both the Department of Defense and U.S. Agency for International
Development leverage their own legal authorities: DoD Direct Prize Authority and USAID
Innovation Incentive Award Authority, respectively. See the <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R45271.pdf">Congressional Report ServiceFederal Prize Competitions report (April 2020)</a> for more information.</p>
