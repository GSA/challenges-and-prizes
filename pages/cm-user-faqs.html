  <h3>Challenge Management</h3>
  <details>
    <summary><em><b>What’s the process for listing a prize competition or crowdsourcing campaign on Challenge.Gov?</b></em></summary>
    <br>
    <p>You (or someone from your challenge team) will create the listing for your agency’s prize competition or crowdsourcing campaign using the platform’s Challenge Creation Wizard. The wizard will walk you through the steps to create the tile that will appear on the Challenge.Gov homepage, as well as the details page. When setting up your listing you will have options for: publication date & time; single or multiple phase competition; collection of submissions via Challenge.Gov or an external site or email; default or custom URL.</p>
    <p>Once your competition content is created, you will submit your challenge to the Challenge.Gov support team for review. Please allow up to two business days for the team to complete this review.</p>
    <p>Refer to section II.A -Create a New Challenge of the Challenge Manager User Guide for step-by-step instructions.</p>

  <details>
    <summary><em><b>Once my listing is live on Challenge.Gov, can I make updates to it?</b></em></summary>
    <br>
    <p>YES! You are in full control of your listing content and can make updates as needed at any time. Any updates you make to a published prize competition do not need review by the Challenge.Gov support team, and will go live on the site once finalized by you.</p>
    <p>Refer to section II.D -Make Updates to an Open Challenge of the Challenge Manager User Guide for more information.</p>

    <summary><em><b>Will Challenge.Gov visitors automatically be notified when an update is made to the listing?</b></em></summary>
    <br>
    <p>No. The system does not automatically notify Challenge.Gov visitors when updates have been made to your listing. Communication regarding these updates is up to you. Should you wish to provide notification of an update there are two ways you can do this: (1) display an “important announcement” banner on your listing; (2) send a bulletin email to followers of your challenge.</p>
    <p>Refer to sections II.G-Add a Challenge Announcement and V.A-Send Bulletin to Followers of Your Challenge of the Challenge Manager User Guide for more information.</p>
