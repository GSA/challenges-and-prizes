The Challenge.gov platform is available at no cost to all federal agencies to help them list their challenge and prize competitions and learn how to engage the public through this innovative approach.

Contact the Challenge.gov team at team@challenge.gov to learn how to get started. 

Thinking about running a challenge and prize competition at your agency, but really want to talk to someone who has done it? Better yet, want to talk to somebody at your own agency, or someone who has run the same type of challenge you want to run?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, the Challenges and Prizes Community of Practice is for you!

The Challenges and Prizes Community of Practice is an inter-agency group of more than 730 U.S. government professionals encouraging innovation in government by promoting challenges, prizes, contests, and competitions through public crowdsourcing.

Members of the community gather about four times a year to share ideas, review best practices, and discuss policies and procedures, but also participate remotely in online trainings, webinars and other activities. Membership and participation is open to federal, state, local and tribal governments. We host a listserv for members to ask questions, announce new challenges and prizes, voting opportunities, challenge results and impact, events, research, resources, and more.

To join the listserv, send an email to challenges@listserv.gsa.gov and indicate SUBSCRIBE in the subject line.

You can also keep up with the community and Challenge.gov on social media.
