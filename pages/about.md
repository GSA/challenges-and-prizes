# About Challenge.gov

Welcome to Challenge.Gov - the official hub for challenges and prize competitions across the U.S. federal government.

Challenge.Gov, managed by the General Services Administration, is a leading program that supports federal agencies to mature and scale the use of prize competitions in order to advance their missions. The Challenge.Gov team delivers this support by offering advanced infrastructure, empowering members of the Challenge and Prize Community of Practice, hosting interactive learning experiences, and developing practical toolkits. 

Through this Challenge.Gov website, federal agencies can engage public solvers in challenges and prize competitions (together referred to as “prize competitions”) to identify innovative solutions to critical issues.

This site also provides a [comprehensive toolkit](<({{ site.baseurl }}/toolkit/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}>) for federal employees interested in or currently running prize competitions. Developed with insights from experts across government, this toolkit contains a robust repository of resources, best practices, and case studies. 

**About Prize Competitions**

U.S. government agencies constantly work to address issues that affect people, communities, and industries throughout the country and even the world. Sometimes, they need help.

Since 2010, the U.S. government has run over 1,200 prize competitions - engaging public solvers ranging from students and hobbyists to small business owners and academic researchers.

Longitude and ship navigation, Lindbergh’s transatlantic flight, even initial designs for the U.S. Capitol and White House—all were the result of open prize competitions. More recently, challenges have produced concepts for the next “lunar loo” (space toilet), an improved digital wallet user interface, protecting fish from water infrastructure, opioid detection in international mail, and “getting out the count” for the census.

And yes, those self-driving vehicles got their start in federal prize competitions too!

**Become a Public Solver**

If you’re interested in being a public solver, start by browsing the [catalog](<({{ site.baseurl }}{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}>) of prize competitions on Challenge.Gov. If something catches your eye, dive in a little deeper to find out how to submit your ideas and concepts. Every prize competition is structured differently, and the details matter. Make sure to follow the detailed instructions to submit your entry correctly and before the posted deadline.

If you have a question about a specific challenge, reach out to the point of contact for that challenge.
