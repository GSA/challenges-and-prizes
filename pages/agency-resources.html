  <summary><h4>What is Challenge.Gov?</h4></summary>
Challenge.Gov, managed by Technology Transformation Services (TTS), within the General Services Administration, supports federal agencies to mature and scale the use of prize
competitions and crowdsourcing campaigns in order to advance their missions. The Challenge.Gov team delivers this support by offering advanced infrastructure, empowering
members of the Challenge and Prize Community of Practice, hosting interactive learning experiences, and developing practical toolkits.

This Challenge.Gov platform is the central hub for prize competitions across the U.S. federal government. Through this platform, federal agencies can engage public solvers in prize
competitions and crowdsourcing campaigns to identify innovative solutions to important issues.
